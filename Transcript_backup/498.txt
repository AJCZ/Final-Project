LEVINE: Today is July 3rd, 1995 and I’m here in Whitinsville, Massachusetts and I’m here with Elsie Vandercook Finnema who came from the Netherlands—another person from Friesland, when she was eight years old in 1920. Mrs. Finnema is eighty-three years old of the date of this interview, and I want to say I’m delighted to have discovered you here…

FINNEMA: Oh thank you.

LEVINE: …and to be able to talk with you.

FINNEMA: Nice to meet you.

LEVINE: Thank you. Lets start with your birth date—if  you would say it for the tape.

FINNEMA: My birthdate well was in April 29, 1912. I was born in Heerevaeen and do you want me to spell that?

LEVINE: Yes please. 

FINNEMA: Capital H-E-E-R-E-V-A-E-E-N you see a double “E” in Dutch is like a long “A” here: Heerevaeen.

LEVINE: Oh…say it again.

FINNEMA: Heerevaeen. 
 
LEVINE: Heerevaeen. 

FINNEMA: Mm-hmm.

LEVINE: Now did you live in Heerevaeen up until you left…

FINNEMA: Until I left the Netherlands, yes. 

LEVINE: Okay. Now what do you remember about the town itself?

FINNEMA: It was nice. I went to school. I went to a Christian school there in Heerevaeen for three years I went there. And as children we didn’t have much. We were rather poor but we made our own fun, and it was nice—especially Christmas time was always a very nice time for us.

LEVINE: What did you do at Christmas?

FINNEMA: Well for one thing in the church we always had a huge Christmas tree, which was so happen…we didn’t have much of anything else but that Christmas tree meant a lot to us, and we would all go be very happy. 

LEVINE: Do you remember the tree? I mean like did some people go and cut it down? 

FINNEMA: Yes it was a fresh tree, and they had it all full of candles. Of course at that time they didn’t have the lights like we have today.  

LEVINE: So they were real?

FINNEMA: They were real candles but they were man made—they botched it. It was nice and then they had a regular program, and then when we got home we always got a box of candy, a book, and an orange—that was the only orange we got for the whole year [laughs]. 

LEVINE: Wow.

FINNEMA: So it was nice and we had a beautiful church too. We went to church. My father was very active when he was living, in the church, and my mother. We all went as a family. 

LEVINE: What was your father’s name?

FINNEMA: Gerpa. G-E-R-P-A. Gerpa

LEVINE: Gerpa, and your mother’s name?

FINNEMA: Elizabeth.

LEVINE: And her maiden name?

FINNEMA: Vanderbrug.

LEVINE: Vanderburg…B-U-R-G?

FINNEMA: B-U-R-G. Yes. Vanderbrug.

LEVINE: Uh huh and how about brothers and sisters?

FINNEMA: I had two sisters and one brother. My two older sister Ann passed away a year ago—last June…about the first of June—and then my sister Hilda has been gone I would say about twenty years. She had cancer and my other sister had Alzheimer’s, and my brother is at the Lincoln Street nursing home. He’s been there now fifteen years; he had a massive stroke and so his right side is paralyzed, and so it also affected his speech. So he’s there in the wheel chair in the nursing home. But I go to see him whenever I have a chance, which isn’t very often because we don’t have a car anymore. Gary can’t drive and hasn’t driven for four years, so I don’t get to see him as often as I would like, but anyway, and then I’m the youngest of them. 

LEVINE: Oh the baby.

FINNEMA: Yes, uh huh. 

LEVINE: So how about grandparents—did you have grandparents in the Netherlands?

FINNEMA: No, not in the Netherlands. I had an aunt; my father had one sister and she lived in Sneek—that’s spelled S-N-E-E-K, Sneek, and she had…they had a very lovely home. And she had one daughter and they were very good to me—to us as a family you know—especially after my mother brought up a child after her husband died, you know that’s not easy.

LEVINE: Why don’t you…wait…just let me pause for a second here. 

LEVINE: Okay we’re resuming now, having corrected the hearing aid noise…

FINNEMA:…noise.

LEVINE: Okay let’s see why don’t you tell the story of your father and how he died young.

FINNEMA: Yes he died young and he died of pneumonia and he was only forty-one years old and because he was going to be forty-two in November. Anyway he was forty-one when he died and even that’s young, and he had pneumonia. He had been working—they were building a new Christian school in that area—and he collapsed. He hadn’t been feeling good; my mother didn’t want him to go to work, but oh well anyway that’s part of the story but he died anyway. When he got home he passed.

LEVINE: Now was he a carpenter or he was…?

FINNEMA: No he was working there in the Christian school. It was rather hard work for him to do. He wasn’t too well a man, you know, in his married life, he wasn’t too well but that’s beside the point.

LEVINE: Now how old were you when he actually died?

FINNEMA: I wasn’t born. My mother was…

LEVINE: Oh your mother was pregnant with you.


FINNEMA: My mother was fourth months pregnant when he died. So you see that wasn’t easy to bring up a small baby and then you have three; you see Ann was ten and Hilda was seven, and Bill was five, and then I was on the way. And it wasn’t easy of course she had children in between that too that died. 

LEVINE: Now can you remember any—either your mother or later or anybody else actually having a child or giving birth—I mean how it was done in the town that you were in? 

FINNEMA: Well you had a midwife. My mother had this certain lady, and she took care of all four of her children and this is what they did. They had the babies at home, and she was a very good lady; she was good to my mother in other ways too. She was a very nice person.

LEVINE: And how about the church—what kind of a part did that play in your life at the time?

FINNEMA: Well we went to a reform church in Holland. Where we go now is what they called a Christian Reform Church. But my father wasn’t…didn’t approve of that. It was a separation years ago between the Reform Church and the Christian Reform.

LEVINE: Oh really?

FINNEMA: Yes the reform church is really the church of Holland; that’s the church of Holland—that’s where the Queen goes. But the Christian Reform was when? Barely sixties I would say eighteen-sixty- something—that was a certain group that started that. But my father never…we always were for the reform church, and that’s where we went in Holland. But the Reform Church is almost more like the Presbyterian Church—like their catechism, their rules and regulations are similar to the Presbyterian Church.  But of course when we came here we couldn’t speak English naturally, and of course in the church everything was in the Holland language: your sermons, your catechism, your Sunday school. But of course when we came here that was nigh for us but that was all we could understand but this is America and we have to learn English. The first thing our cousins told us when we came to this country is you’re in America…[Tape skips at 0:08:41] and we did. 

LEVINE: Now will the…between the Christian Reform and the Reform. You were in the Reform Church in Holland and when you came here?

FINNEMA: Christian Reform because it was in the Holland language—that’s what we could understand. There was no Reform Church here, it was just a Christian Reform, and all are relatives went there so we automatically went there, and I still remember that. 

LEVINE: I see. Okay now getting back to when you were still in Holland. What do you remember doing like on a given day? 

FINNEMA: Well Christmas was always a big event. I told you but not only church but of course you have two holidays there—the sixth of December is really Christmas like for the children—that’s when you have your gifts and that’s when Santa Claus comes you know, and it used to be if we went to school, the day that Santa Claus arrived from the North Pole say; he came in a big barge and he would have…he would be on a beautiful white horse, and he would sit with a white robe on and he had a crown with a gold on it…and he had a gold staff, and he would ride down the street, and the kids—all of us—were elated this…its St. Nicholas of course, that’s St. Nicholas, and we were elated and then maybe we’d get maybe a book or something you know. Of course if you were bad then it’s a peep you called them, [swept the peep], and it was all painted black and he had a bag and two feet sticking out and that was supposed to be a bad boy or girl, you know. But anyway…

LEVINE: [Interrupts] What did you call him before you called him…you called him a Piet?

FINNEMA: A Zvarte Piet.

LEVINE: No it was another name for him?

FINNEMA: No it’s Zvarte Piet. He was… 

LEVINE: Oh Zvarte Piet… black?

FINNEMA: Because he was all painted black and he was the one that picked up the bad boys and girls—that went a lot with the children. Well we didn’t have much though in the line of money or gifts or anything. But my aunt from the [Unintelligible: 0:10:55] Sneek, she always gave us some nice things; we always got a nice gift, maybe a nice sweater or something, and then she always had this pastry, you know...but of course got a big chocolate and each one and I had an issue because of course mine would be eaten …and we’d get that on with a cake…she’d make nice cookies and she said we always looked forward to that, that was [Unintelligible 0:11:22-26] you know. But then the real Christmas, the 25th of December was in the church and that was a holy day—no gifts you know it was sacred—we went to church and so on, but it was nice. 

LEVINE: This aunt that sent you the gifts on St. Nicholas’ day—did you see her?

FINNEMA: Oh yes. I went there often. I used to go with my mother, and we had oh we called it [Unintelligible: 0:11:50] and it was on the same idea as the Sneek from Heerevaeen, and we used to go from Sneek to Heerevaeen. My two older sisters and brother were already in school so see I was the youngest and I was in school. But the neighbors would take care of them and I would go with my mother to my aunt because she used to have—as I told you—she had a beautiful home, and we’d go over there and she’d help her because around the holidays especially…she was a lady [laughs]. If I ever had a picture…she was a beautiful woman.

LEVINE: What was her name?

FINNEMA: Tante. We called her tante that means aunty. Tante.

LEVINE: Now was she your mother’s sister?

FINNEMA: No she was my father’s sister; my father only had one sister…had only the one sister, and then we would go over there and my mother and I would sit…we’d sleep in the alcove; she always had an alcove in the living room you know. And my mother and I… I do remember going on the tram…

LEVINE: How do you spell that tram?

FINNMEA: T. We spell it T-R-A-M, tram. 

LEVINE: Oh tram. 

FINNEMA: [Laughs] And go there…and then my cousin was there and she had one daughter, and she had a bicycle and she put me on the back of the bicycle and take me all around town [laughs]. So those are the good memories I have and then we came here and it was nice coming here and meeting all our cousins and everything. We couldn’t talk to them at first but we slowly picked it up.

LEVINE: Now what else did you do for enjoyment? Did you…did you have grandparents who were alive?

FINNEMA: Uh no, they were all gone. It was the only one we had in Holland was my aunt—my mother’s sister—and the grandparents yeah died long before, yeah.

LEVINE: So this aunt was your father’s sister…

FINNEMA: [Interrupts] sister. 

LEVINE: … but your mother didn’t have sisters or brothers?

FINNEMA: My mother. Oh my sisters around here and mine so that’s why [Unintelligible 0:13:59]. She had one brother and he’s the one that paid for our way over here because after I was born they wanted as I say right away but …

LEVINE: Do we need to stop? No not today… [Seems as though a door opens and mumbling at 0:14:18].

FINNEMA; So anyway…

LEVINE: Your brother of your…

FINNEMA: [Interrupts] My mother…my mother’s brother. He paid for our way over here.

LEVINE: And he was already here?

FINNEMA: He was already here. My mother’s sisters were already here; she had four sisters, and they were already here too. 

LEVINE: And then the war broke out.

FINNEMA: And then the war broke out for the first time, and then so we had to stay another three years. So I was three years old the first time that they were…we were going to go, and see I was eight so we had to wait five years before we could go. You know it was hard and especially during the war—you know many, many times that we didn’t have much to eat either because everything was rationed—but we managed.

LEVINE: What else do you remember about those war years?

FINNEMA: Well it wasn’t very pleasant because my mother used to work for these rich people and sometimes they would get these things black market, and she would like—one of the ladies who would give my mother over on Saturday or Sunday some tea and some coffee and a few things, so she could make herself a a cup of tea, you know during the war. But everything was rationed, wasn’t very pleasant. So then afterwards when my uncle did sent the money and we came—we planned to go to America, my mother’s cousin who was a minister, who lived not too far from where we lived. And he was very good to my mother. He took her to Rotterdam to get the passport and things like that you know and I can remember going there to Sunday dinner—you know Sunday—very nice. So…so that wasn’t all bad, it was a lot of good things too.

LEVINE: Can you remember any times, any experiences that you remember fondly about being there? I mean and you mentioned St. Nicholas day but were there any other times that…

FINNEMA: Oh there were things. I don’t know some to me…some people it doesn’t make sense but my mother used to make [Unintelligible: 0:16:35] with one of the neighbor ladies and she’d uh…because the night before Christmas we’d always have [piepernuf] you know with little round pieces.

LEVINE: How do you spell that, piepernuf?

FINNEMA: P-I-E-P-…uh…

LEVINE: [Interrupts] Its piepernuf, right?

FINNEMA: Its piepernuf but we call it [piepernut] [laughs]. I don’t know offhand that’s just how I spell it but anyway she’d make arrangements—this lady—along with the neighbor ladies and of course we’re kids and all of a sudden there’d be banging on the door, you know and they’d say ‘who’s at the door?’ and why would she say ‘go to the door, see who that is!’ and this woman would have a whole bag—my mother had bought them at the bake shop—the piepernut—and she’d come in and threw them all on the floor and we’d all land on the floor and get the…to see who would get the most, you know like kids would…but other than that we didn’t have much; we were poor.

LEVINE: When did you…how about skates—skating?

FINNEMA: Well I didn’t skate. My sister Ann did and Hilda; they skated. But I didn’t; my mother had a nice pair of skates because she was a good skater when she was young, you know. As a matter of fact we had them here but then my nephew wanted to borrow one time and then never saw them again. But I have Gary’s father’s skates here; he used to be a racer, you know…they had to… when there was ice and then you have to go through thirteen counties, and his father won the prize, and I got the skates I think.

LEVINE: Oh wonderful.

FINNEMA: Yeah, they’re right in the chest there. 

LEVINE: So…so this would be an annual event?

FINNEMA: An annual event oh yes, and sometimes when people really [Unintelligible: 0:18:17] just sway back and forth, and they liked to skate, [microphone moving and sound unintelligible: 0:18:25] and they lived here the [Skatanisis] and they liked to skate and one time our arcade pond here was frozen, it was one of those cold winters, and her and her husband [Karen Gerban] they’d go like this you know; they’d sway along and they’d skate—oh beautiful skaters. Well of course everyone had skates in Holland but my mother—we were as I saw we were poor; my mother couldn’t afford it but my sister Ann got skates and Hilda, they both skated.

LEVINE: Now how about the canals in general—can you think of any either experiences on the canals or…?

FINNEMA: [Interrupts] Oh yes, oh yes. It was nice because I can remember most everybody had a little boat, you know and you’d go down the canal, and I remember this man said—I was just a small child—but I can still remember he said, “would you like a ride you know on the canal?” and even in boat [laughs] [Unintelligible: 0:19:29].

LEVINE: What is that?

FINNEMA: Get…come in the boat.

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. 

FINNEMA: And I would go and say…I would tell my mother okay I had a ride on the canal, and it was nice and other than that I don’t know so much you know, I was only eight. But my sisters they…well they had friends and they went out for walks. She didn’t have much money [Microphone error, unintelligible: 0:19:54]…in the best way you could, you know you’d go for long walks and we had a very nice park where they called it the Jarjanje boat. 

LEVINE: How do you spell it?

FINNEMA: J-A-R-J-A-N-J-E. Jarjanje, and the boat was definitely old… round the boat, and it was a nice park and they had boats and everything else and that would be our entertainment.

LEVINE: How about music. Was there any music or dancing?

FINNEMA: Um not so much dancing, but music—we used to sing a lot you know and even like sometimes on a Sunday…Sunday night we’d have supper and my mother would say, ‘well lets sing a hymn’ and my mother and the four of us kids we’d all sing and you know in Dutch they sing and they take the sounds and they put it to music and they set their song…they sung as a chorale; all the notes are of even length; like I know still some of those hymns—a couple of them—that I learned in school in Holland like the [Names song; unintelligible: 0:21:22]

LEVINE: Could you sing like a part of one?

FINNEMA: Oh no I can’t. No, I don’t want to do that. 

LEVINE: No? Okay.

FINNEMA: And it would be this in the song…[coughs; unintelligible: 0:21:33]. You know we used to…

LEVINE: [Interrupts] And they were of equal notes?

FINNEMA: All the notes. I have a little Dutch song; all the notes were of equal length, and just where they are…if I had known I shouldn’t…they’re like well I can’t find it now but I know its in the drawer…but… 

LEVINE: And was this a little book that you brought?

FINNEMA: Oh some and we brought it to church and that’s what we sang. 

LEVINE: And you brought it back from the Netherlands to this country? 

FINNEMA: Oh yeah. Well they had yeah I… and when they…we have some but most of them you could buy because in Grand Rapids there was a lot of Dutch printing and in New jersey too, so yeah, and of course as I say when we first came here—the first two years that we were in this country—it was still all Dutch. You had catechism, you had Sunday school, you had sermons, but then Dr. [Bauma] he was…he went to Harvard; he was a student at Harvard and he could of course speak English and so he decided, well he talked to a lot of people, his sister and so forth and he said ‘you know you have a lot of young people here and you are in America,’ and he says ‘these people have got to learn the English language.’ So he used to come down I think it was every other Sunday and he’d preach at night—see we used to have services at ten o’clock in the morning to the night…but then at night it was the English language. Well of course you learn English all week at school and of course you learned English all week in school and it was so the kids…and all of us kids—we loved that but the old people were very against it at first. But of course now it’s all different because everything is English…everything. The only. ..

LEVINE: [Interrupts]…sorry. 

FINNEMA: The only thing is there is one Christmas song we have in our hymnal and you can either sing it in Dutch or you can sing it in English you know: “Eere god”—its a Christmas hymn, and so at Christmas the minister will always say ‘those who can sing it in Dutch, sing it in Dutch, if you can sing it English, sing it English’ [laughs]. It’s kind of nice. 

LEVINE: Very nice. Now what is the title of that? What is it…what does it translate to? 

FINNEMA: Eere god. Yeah… [er] means honor…er… honor the Lord. 

LEVINE: Honor the lord. 

FINNEMA: Yeah. Yes Eere god. 

LEVINE: Now could you spell that—the title in Dutch? 

FINNEMA: In Dutch its spelled E-E-R-E and that’s one word, and then god is g-o-d but the “G” you pronounce “hot.”

LEVINE: Hot. 

FINNEMA: Yeah.

LEVINE: Uh huh so as far as other recreation that maybe your mother and father had? What would they do for recreation…or just your mother?

FINNEMA: Well my father…my mother…well we didn’t do much; we made our own fun. As I say we’d sit around the table as a family and play dominoes or anything like that—any game like that. And we’d sit around the table…that’s the way our—what do they call it?—[tinya] we used to call. What do they call it here? Oh they have a lot of it going around the different churches.

LEVINE: Bingo?

FINNEMA: Bingo—its fun with that idea—they would call numbers. But we used to play…we used to do that as kids but we made our own fun because we didn’t have any money to spend on anything else. And it was the same when we first came here, everything was strange, and we had to learn the language but it was…as children I mean going to school seemed no time at all I was talking English. You know you are in it everyday and you soon learn. But we had to all have a start in the first grade to learn the language see, and this girl who goes to the women’s club—Christian women’s club—that goes once a month, we were talking about that and I said to Frances, she said you know your mother was my first teacher in the first grade. 

LEVINE: Oh wow. 

FINNEMA: So it was…that was quite an experience to come to another country when you can’t speak the language. Of course my older sister when she was married, her and her husband and daughter went to Holland because his folks were still living and they spent three months there and they enjoyed it. The only thing…they had one daughter Louise, and they have a Dutch dish, oh I shouldn’t say that on the phone. “Soup 'n brye we called it; it’s made with buttermilk. Louise says to her mother ‘Mommy I don’t like that Dutch soup—that sour soup.’ She said well so… she explained it to Peter’s father and she said well if she doesn’t like it, she doesn’t have to it, you know. But that’s what she called it, she called it sour soup—it’s made from buttermilk—but to the Dutch people it’s quite a treat. There’s even a lady upstairs here; she’s Dutch and she makes it, and then this other lady who lives next door in the retirement home here, she’ll go over and say [speaks Dutch], which means ‘this is delicious’ I thought oh! [laughs].

LEVINE: And what did you call it—the name of the soup?

FINNEMA: Soup 'n brye. No don’t put that…oh it’s already there. 

LEVINE: Soup 'n brye.

FINNEMA: I should…I have to keep…be careful of what I say.

LEVINE: Okay so let’s see—anything else about food that you remember from…?

FINNEMA: Well I think of course as I say with my mother being a widow, and when we first came here…of course Ann…when we came here Ann was seventeen, Hilda was fifteen, and Bill was eleven and I was eight. So my sister Ann got a job in a shop, and my mother got a job in a shop, and she hated it. And my sister Hilda got a little job as housework; Bill and I were home, and my grandmother took care of my brother and I; he was eleven and I was eight, but then we went to school and then my mother stopped working and things changed…which for or the better.

LEVINE: Well before you left there… was there…were there any customs that you remember over there that either got dropped when you came here or changed somewhat?

FINNEMA: What do you mean customs?

LEVINE: Any ways of doing things or how about dress—do you remember?

FINNEMA: Oh well we came…yeah well we dressed just like the other people do. Well we came here, yes we just had our ordinary clothes but of course in those days you didn’t have a car anyway but you sent for things. You had like so many catalogues, and my sister Ann, she was working in the shop and she worked with this lady and this lady could speak Dutch a little bit and so she said ‘you know I’d like a new dress’, and she said ‘well you know what we do here, we have catalogues and you send it out’ and she said ‘I’ll tell you how to make out an order.’ So she taught Ann how to make out on order and from that day, we had some nice clothes because we all worked and we all…and Ann would make out the order so. 

LEVINE: How about the clothing in the Netherlands?

FINNEMA: Well it was similar to here—I wish I had some…I have a lot of pictures of how we looked when we came from Holland.

LEVINE: Oh yeah?

FINNEMA: Yes. 
 
LEVINE: Can you describe it for the tape? How you looked then?

FINNEMA: Well it’s hard. It one picture it was my mother and I—I was a baby then—and my two sisters and they both had white and black checkered dresses on because they were still mourning my father. You know they mourned a lot in the old country.

LEVINE: Oh really. How long?

FINNEMA: Yes. Oh my mother wore black for a long time, and my sisters Hilda and Ann. I have pictures of that—they were white and black-checkered dresses and black stockings and shoes—and as a matter of fact I was saying I was born after my father’s death, and one lady said ‘you know’ she says, ‘I’m making her a christening outfit.’ She made a bonnet and a dress and what do you suppose she made it with black. I said to my mother afterwards, it was terrible putting white and black on a baby [laughs]. But that was—she thought she was doing a favor, and she thought it was the right thing to do so.

LEVINE: Do you remember any of those kinds of ritual things like weddings or funerals that in the Netherlands…?

FINNEMA: Well at that time my mother told us when my father passed away, they had a…and they would put a robe on him, like say a choir robe—it was white—my mother said. She explained it to me and it had a big black bow all the way down, and that’s the way…well they don’t put on their own clothes, they just wore…they put a robe on him in the casket and that’s the way he was buried…where here you are fully dressed so.

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. I see. Lets see. Is there anything else about the old country…when you think about…?

FINNEMA: [Interrupts] Well my niece, the one who lives in her summer home now…oh what is it? Duxbury. She lives in Duxbury. She has a beautiful summer home there and all her kids are there just now and uh and now where do I start…oh and when we came here well it was different with the clothes and everything but we got used to that.

LEVINE: Do you remember when you first heard you were going to leave?

FINNEMA: She hated to leave you know because she said well we don’t know the language but so my folks out here in Whitinsville they kept writing and writing, and my uncle said ‘don’t worry about the cost I’m paying for everything’ and he did—he paid for all five of us, which was nice. So and he was the only brother she had, and he…they’ve always been good to us—very good. And because we didn’t always have the best of everything because and then pretty soon well I went to school…two of us went to school but Ann worked; Ann was a saver. She was always a thrifty one, but she was very good. And Hilda was…took up sewing and she was a seamstress so she made me a dress [laughs]…you know different things like that. Bit I don’t know if these things matter.

LEVINE: Oh yeah well. They are all very interesting. Okay so when you left do you remember what your mother took with you or what you brought?

FINNEMA: Well we had—my mother’s friend whose husband was a carpenter—made these huge boxes like a table you know square and as high as that, and we put…I even…my mother’s old sewing machine from Holland here, but I and I sewed on it a lot. I made a lot of things. Its one of these you can you turn with your hand you know, and that’s well over one hundred years old because she bought it when she was seventeen years old. She started working and the first thing she bought was a sewing machine. So that went along to America. 

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. Anything else you can remember that came along?

FINNEMA: Well my mother had little some nice things in Holland and oh she had a nice stoofkje. We call it a stoofkje. You put it on your table when you have tea, and I have one in here and then if you have company—like I do this a lot in the winter—and I call my Dutch friend who’s upstarts down and I say Jean ‘come on down, have a cup of tea,’ and especially if it’s a cold wintry day then I have the stoofkje with a teapot on it and we sit here and we have a cup of tea. 

LEVINE: How do you spell stoofkje?

FINNEMA: S-T-O-O-F-K-J-E.

LEVINE: Huh. 

FINNEMA: Stoofkje. Oh my mother had a beautiful one and she gave it to my sister and I missed out on that one. The one I got there is Gary’s grandmother’s stoofkje.

LEVINE: So that came to this country too?

FINNEMA: Yes Yes.

LEVINE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh, and did you personally as an eight year old bring anything that you didn’t want to leave behind? 

FINNEMA: No I…we didn’t have much you know. We brought just the clothes and my mother brought the sewing machine, and you know a few things—not too much. But other than that…we didn’t have too much to bring. We were glad to get here and so on.

LEVINE: Now do you remember leaving—the departure?

FINNEMA: Yes we went to…we stayed with a cousin of mine in Rotterdam, and then they took us to the boat the next day and we slept there the last night that we were in Holland. I can remember that—that’s all—and from there we went on the boat

LEVINE: Uh-huh and the name of the boat?

FINNEMA: New Amsterdam.

LEVINE: And do you remember anything about the passage?

FINNEMA: Its cost you mean?

LEVINE: No. Well anything about the trip over.

FINNEMA: Well I think for Bill and I—we were eight and eleven—we went for fifty dollars each, and my mother and my two sisters were a hundred dollars each for passage.

LEVINE: And what were your accommodations on the boat?

FINNEMA: Oh they were very good. We had good meals and everything and of course Bill being the only boy…that he had to be downstairs with the men, and of course my mother felt bad, and the captain was very nice and he was very sympathetic and spoke Dutch also. And he says, ‘don’t be afraid, I’m going to take care of you son.’ He said…you know because she was worried. He was eleven at the time and she said ‘well he’s my only boy’, and he said ‘don’t you worry I’ll take care of him.’ It was very good; they were very good. 

LEVINE: Now were you in steerage, were you in third class, were you in the cabin?

FINNEMA: We were in the cabin, yes.

LEVINE: And were there any events that happened on route…on the boat?
 
FINNEMA: Well we had a couple of days it was pretty stormy; it was up and down you know, and seasick, oh man. And on the first two days you know everything was so good on the tables, and the captain says ‘come and eat,’ and we did but then everybody gets seasick you know and that was the end of the food. But it was a good trip, and but when we landed in Ellis Island my brother was always on the ball and he looked and he said ‘there’s Uncle Hetsen!’ he says to my mother. ‘There’s Uncle Hetsen!’ You know he remembered him from the picture, you know.

LEVINE: What was his name?

FINNEMA: Hetsen. 

LEVINE: H…

FINNEMA: H-E-T-S-E-N. Hetsen. He says ‘oh there’s uncle Hetsen’ and my mother says you stay here—she was so afraid he was going to get lost. So anyway they were very nice on Ellis Island you know.

LEVINE: Do you remember any examinations?

FINNEMA: Oh yes they were there in your eyes and they weren’t too gentle either you know. Of course there were so many people, and there were all kinds—all nationalities, you know—and there was one lady there in our room, and she kind of clung to my mother. But her boyfriend…well she came alone…and her boyfriend was supposed to meet her. She was supposed to get married but we had to go because my uncle came after us and I don’t know whatever became of her, whether her boyfriend ever came or not, I don’t know… he was supposed to meet her at the boat. Whatever happened to her I don’t know. 

LEVINE: Did you stay over night at Ellis Island?

FINNEMA: I don’t think so. I’m not sure about that but I don’t think so because we uh…as I say my brother Bill saw my uncle and so we were all anxious you know to get there, and so there he was with another man and so from there we went on the train to Whitinsville. And then they had a truck there and they took them to one of my aunts; they lived up on the Williams Hill on the other side of town and that’s where we landed up on Williams Hill. So it was quite a trip. We were ten days on the water—on the ocean.

LEVINE: Uh huh and do you remember when you first got to this country any of the things that struck you?

FINNEMA: Well I came to the…we came to my aunt’s and of course all the children there were speaking English. I looked at one and then I looked at the other, I said…and my sister says we’ll never learn this, we’ll never learn, and I said I don’t know. I was only eight years old but anyway we soon picked it up. When you start going to school you soon learn.

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. How about things you saw? Did you see anything?

FINNEMA: On the water?

LEVINE: No when you first got this country that you know that you’d never…

FINNEMA: That impressed us? 

LEVINE: Yeah.

FINNEMA: Well of course we were there I think two or three days up in Williams Hill; we stayed at my aunt’s. She had quite a big house and we stayed there, and then we lived…we went to [Golthway] Road; I don’t know if you know where the [Phelan] church is—you probably don’t. It’s on the other end of town. Well we lived on the house directly across from the Phelan church and of course at that time the church wasn’t there and it was all pasture and some had gardens there; and it was so different; it was really beautiful when we first came to Golthway Road. It was real country and it was in the spring of the year; the trees were all in blossom. It was really beautiful and so then that’s where we had four big rooms there; this man that owned the house, his wife had died the year before so it was six big rooms. So he had the kitchen downstairs and the bedroom upstairs and we had the other floor rooms, so it worked out very nicely and we were happy to be there.

LEVINE: And then what did your father do? I mean your mother do?

FINNEMA: Well she used to do a lot of home nursing, you know, and as I say she didn’t like working in a factory. She said…no she didn’t think it was nice for a woman to work in a factory and so anyway she did a lot of that—home nursing—but you didn’t get much money. I’ll tell you that at time—of course everything was cheaper then too, you got to figure it that way—but she’d get two dollars a day and with that she and to take care of the mother, the baby, baby wash, and then the husband would come home at noon for dinner, and she’d have to cook them dinner and then she’d home after supper. So that wasn’t an easy job either but she enjoyed doing it and she did that for a long time. She brought a lot of babies into the world [Laughs].

LEVINE: And then your sister went to work?

FINNEMA: Yes my sister Ann worked in the shop. She was seventeen and she doesn’t care too much about it and then later on she got a job working for Mrs. [Rainer], she was a farm school teacher and she worked there, and her husband was a foreman in a shop. And so she got a job there cooking. So she did that and she liked that very much; she was a good girl, and my sister Hilda, what did she do? I don’t know; she did a little of everything I guess and Bill and I were in school. Of course Hilda had to go to school to because she was only fourteen or fifteen. She had to go to school too so.

LEVINE: And did you learn any new things here like games or…?

FINNEMA: Oh yes. We had neighbors near us there and they had I think six children. Oh yes. Well children soon learn and chime in with other kids, and no time at all we were playing hopscotch and all the other games that the children had. I think was interesting.

LEVINE: Now were you ever called like “green-borns” or were you singled out for having just come to this country?  

FINNEMA: No I can’t remember that no, and I don’t think that would be very nice either [laughs].

LEVINE: No, no but it happened a lot—but maybe more in cities perhaps. 

FINNEMA: Perhaps, maybe so. No and I can’t say…we went to church every Sunday and so on, and we had to go to catechism, Sunday school and of course we had to learn that in English. In the first few years that they were here was fine because it was in Dutch and we could learn that more easily. But then when it was English by that time we could speak English pretty well so it wasn’t that hard after all. 

LEVINE: And then when did you stop going to school, and what did you do?

FINNEMA: Well I only went through the eighth grade because my mother worked so hard at bringing us, and my two sisters by this time were married, my brother who had…in the meat business—he had his own business. And so I went to school; I was in the eighth grade and I quit, because I felt so sorry for my mother, I said ‘I’ll get a job’ and so I said to mom ‘you stay home’ so that’s what I did. And then I worked in the shop for a quite few years and then before that I took care of a Mr. Brown—he had brain cancer—and I took care of him. And then the doctor wanted me to go in training. I says I can’t because I don’t have the money. I don’t have the money and I says I didn’t go to high school, but at that time you could only need two years of high school but I said I cant afford that anyway.

LEVINE: Is that something you would have liked to do?

FINNEMA: Yes because after I got through…I worked twenty-seven years in the machine works…as a purchasing inspector and then after I got laid off—there was a big layoff and I was one of them—and so then I went to work in St. [Lou’s?]—that was a hospital for chronic diseases, where you had cancer, heart attack, stroke, anything like that and I loved it. I worked there and I retired from there. I liked it very…and then after I retired from there then now I switched to nursing. I had been home for about eight months and I met this other girl who worked with me at St. Lou. She said do you know that they want help in northern Jersey, how would you like to go back to work? And as old as I am now, so I says well let’s go up, and I didn’t think they would hire me. They said you could start right away if you wanted to. I said no, no way how it’s done. I think this was on a Thursday. I said I’ll start at the beginning of the week so then I worked for two and a half years there, and then I quit for good.

LEVINE: So when did you meet your husband?

FINNEMA: Well I had a very good friend, and it happened to be Gary’s cousin, and her…Gary’s mother had been very sick so her father said I want to see my sister. They were living in [Blackstone] and I want to see my sister, she’s very sick so he wanted to go on the bus and my friend Bert said there’s no way you’re going on the bus, ill take you by car. So we went up there, took the car, so we walked around a little bit and then we came back to the house and there was this young man sitting here and she says oh here’s my cousin Gary. She said I want you to meet him. So he had a …he worked in some mill in Wynsox but he also had a dog food business. So he was sitting downstairs at the bottom…downstairs of the house. So that’s how I met him and that’s how it happened, and if all goes well and he lives to the ninth of September then we will be married forty-five years.

LEVINE: Wow.

FINNEMA: Yeah it was nice. We had a good marriage. He was very good to me—very considerate. I’ve had cancer twice and I almost died the first time, and when I came home after four weeks in the hospital and I still couldn’t do anything. He washed, he ironed, he sewed. He’s a beautiful sewer you know. He did everything. 

LEVINE: Wow.

FINNEMA: Yeah, he was a good husband. I never regretted being married and I was thirty-eight when I got married and he was forty-one so we weren’t too young. But I’ve had other boyfriends but I guess this was it [laughs].

LEVINE: oh that’s nice. Now his name is Gary?

FINNEMA: Gary Finnema.

LEVINE: Did you have children?

FINNEMA: No I did lose one, that is by miscarriage. When I was forty I became pregnant; I was fourth months pregnant and then I lost him. It would have been nice if I had just one but that wasn’t to be.

LEVINE: Right. Mm-hmm. And so how is this time…I know it’s difficult because you’re taking care of your husband now, but this time of your life after retirement?

FINNEMA: Well I really enjoyed it because I have some nice friends and we go out; you know we used to go out to eat here and there and of course now I’m well might I say tied down. Well I said because the other day he had a bad spell and he says to me ‘why don’t you put me in a home? I said Gary as long as I’m able I will take care of you and I’m going to.

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

FINNEMA: I’ve had enough experience in St. [Camilla’s] hospital. I know how to handle it, so anyways that’s its.

LEVINE: Yeah. How about any attitudes or any ways that your mother tried to bring you and your brothers and sisters…?

FINNEMA: I think my mother did a very good job bringing us up alone. We had to toe the mark and sometimes we thought she was strict but she says you know some day you’re going to thank me for it. She was strict—you didn’t get away with anything, and that was all right too. Sometimes I think the parents are too easy today.

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. How about advice—would you have any advice for an eight year old who is immigrating to this country, you know based on your experience?

FINNEMA: Well I would say if you came to this country you got to be sure you have good friends and they go to a good school and start them off right. Of course now they have a beautiful Christian school here; they have it right through high school you know, and they have everything for those children. They have orchestra, they have band, they have everything, and they have a dress code and everything. They are very, very strict but it’s a wonderful, wonderful school.

LEVINE: Now can anyone go to this school?

FINNEMA: Yes, yes, yes oh I think but a third of them are Roman Catholic I think and other nationalities too. 

LEVINE: I see. 

Some come from Worcester. Some come from Northborough. They come from all over, and a lot of people have moved to town. I know one family—they had two daughters—and they came from Northborough. When she first brought them here, she used to commute and she said that was too much so then they bought a condo and now they live here. And there’s so many and a lot of them have joined a church too. But I think it’s a nice; it’s a wonderful school and they have a dress code and they don’t get by with anything.

LEVINE: Now what part would you say that the church has played in your life since you came here as an immigrant?

FINNEMA: Well I know how we had rules and regulations that we go by. We were brought up you know like going to catechism and you know what’s right and what’s wrong, and you abide by that and you know whatever you do in this world you have to answer for some day. Oh that’ll be good. So church and I think the now…my family…one has three children and the other has two, and the three girls and the other one has one, and they came here for Christmas and they call me—that was the first time they came from the church. They knew that Gary was a [chef] … could we come over? I says we’d love to have you. Oh a young couple you know and they have three children. So they came; they brought food, and honestly it was lovely, it was so nice, and then Judy she was a schoolteacher and that’s how she met her husband in a Christian school. She talks to Gary and you know she’s very religious and she says to Gray you know because Gary doesn’t belong to the same church as I do and a lot of the Dutch people resent him for that—which isn’t right. I shouldn’t say that…but that’s true …so she, Judy, will come over and sit on there with him and talk to him. It makes me feel good; you know he’s such a good living person. He really is like his brother was a wonderful violinist. Gary played the accordion, and they used to go when they lived like on the [black’s on grange hall]…and the young people there…because Gary will not drink and his brother either. They will not drink and they have a group of young people; they’d entertain them and they could dance. And then there was a quartet—they Gary and his brother. They both were good singers, and they would have two other fellows, like a quartet who sing in church, who sing for socials, and things like that. He always led a good life—he’s a good, clean living fellow, yeah. But he does not find a reason…I hate some things I hate to say on that like I wouldn’t say that now… but I’ll say that when it’s turned off.

LEVINE: Okay well let’s see. Is there anything else that you can think of—do you think coming here as a young person…do you think that made a difference in your life?

FINNEMA: Oh yes. I think it would. We were glad. This is a good country, and I know there’s a lot of things going on but it’s a good country and I’m thankful we’re here, yeah. Although everybody was good to us in Holland too I will say. They were wonderful to my mother. There was a couple…there were two brothers and a sister and neither one of them married, and they were very wealthy, and they lived on our street and they used to come over to our house. And when they heard we were going to America they said ‘Mrs. Vandercook why do you want to go to America? We’ve helped you and we’d do anything for you,’ and they did—how often did they bring us a nice Sunday dinner or things like but my mother says all my relatives are there. I have no one here.

LEVINE: And how about your mother…did she become a citizen?

FINNEMA: No she didn’t. She couldn’t see its everything as I say…everything was in Dutch…and she…no she did not become a… its too bad that—she said I wished you’d help me but you have to go you know really go to school. You have to read and do everything. But we all became American citizens you know.

LEVINE: Was she happy that she had company?

FINNEMA: Yes. Yes she was after she got used to it. You know it’s a switch going from one country to another. Yeah its…there’s a lot of nice things. My niece went down last year and she wanted me to go. I said no I can’t go. Her son is with this computer science and they sent him to Amsterdam to teach. So he said I’m going for a week, so he says to his mother, pack your suitcase; you’re going with me. So then he says what can I bring you? I want to bring you something…said I don’t know I got plenty of dishes, and I says okay bring me some blue dust sugar and cream. Its beautiful—ill show it to you. It’s really nice. So she brought me that but she wanted to take me to Holland oh it was about three years ago, but then Gary had to go to surgery. He had to…one week he was operated on two—on Monday he was operated on for prostate and on Thursday he was operated for a kidney. He had a malignancy on the kidney. They took out one of his kidneys so he couldn’t go. I said I wont leave him so I never did get to Holland.

LEVINE: Well when you consider yourself—do you consider yourself sort of part Dutch and part American?

FINNEMA: I don’t know I think I’m all-American I would say. I mean how can you say otherwise you know this is a good country. And you know I think you should be glad that you live here. You’re never without food or any number of things, and it’s a wonderful country to live in.

LEVINE: Well I think that’s a perfect place to end. I want to thank you very much for the interview. 

FINNEMA: Oh yeah, thank you.

LEVINE: And I’m speaking with Elsie Vandercook Finnema.

FINNEMA: Mm-hmm.
