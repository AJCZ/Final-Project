DALLETT: My name is Nancy Dallett and I'm speaking with Mr. Lyle Small on Wednesday, June 25, 1986. We're beginning this interview at 9:50 a.m. and we're about to interview Mr. Small about his immigration from Barbados in 1921. This is interview number 196. Can we start back at the beginning of your story, and could you tell me when you were born. SMALL: I was born [. . .] 13, 1898. DALLETT: And where were you born? SMALL: I was born in St. Johns. St. Johns. See them islands [. . .] so I was born in St. Johns. [. . .] St. Johns, by right. DALLETT: And can you tell me a bit about your early childhood memories, about life on St. John as a young boy. SMALL: Well, everybody was most poor people up there, you see. But, they just, it was all like a family, like. You see, each--you live in a certain village. Where we live, it was older folks, and they had a big house, like what do you call, a plantation. Well then it was a sister, a different sister there, four--my grandmother, there was four of them. And each one had a part of that big house. So you [. . .] lived there. So, then they, then after they married, then they still lived the same place, see, still lived the same place. And you, just like one family, they were never, they never hold everybody, you know, each one, they never had no problem or nothing like that. DALLETT: So it was four families, then, that lived together? SMALL: Four sisters--it was Aunt, my grandmother was Aunt--Granny, what was Granny's name? Aunt Margaret. My grandmother was Aunt Margaret. And then her sister was Aunt Liddy. Her sister was Liddy, Liddy. And then, Becca, what's her name--Sammy--I can't think of them names now. Aunt Liddy, Aunt Becca, and Aunt Margaret. So there was three sisters like that, and them was the three, and they're on that--like, I don't know, the property, someone's property, like, and it was [break up] by them, and they still lived there all along. Till we grown, and then after then we leave, I leave. I went then to the city, which was St. Michaels. DALLETT: Was it a plantation, did you say? SMALL: Something like a plan--you would call it a plantation, that's what you would call it, like. I don't know how it was, but that's what it was. We never thought of it, but we lived there, but it was a plantation. DALLETT: What was grown on the plantation? SMALL: Cane. DALLETT: Cane. SMALL: Cane. Mostly cane. DALLETT: Do you remember life on the plantation as a young boy? Did you work at all? SMALL: No, I never work there, I never work on the plantation, never work on the--I, after I get growing up enough, I be leaving, my grandmother leaving, and came to the city. Well, then I actually had probably--and then, the city then, my godfather, he was a, he was the water works. There was a water works there. Well, and most people [. . .] 'cause that was their source of income, at the water works. [Baumeston] Water Works. The name was [Baumeston] Water Works. Well, and he used to work there, he used to work at the centrifugal, where they pump the water, the big pump. And see that [churley horse] go back and forth and pump that water. So then, and all in there was pumped to the different stations around that was the head, and the smaller stations around--huh? There was a, there was pumped to different stations, and that was the source, and then, through the water works, then they used to have to bring up coal, had to bring coal for those machines, so then they would go to the city. Every day they would bring up a load of coal, and that's how, and keep the, everybody keep the family running like. It was like one community, one big family existing like that. DALLETT: How many brothers and sisters did you have then? SMALL: Three brothers. Myself and two others. One is still living. The second one to me is died. A few years ago. Then one, he's still living in Barbados. DALLETT: At what age were you when you moved, you said you moved into the city? SMALL: Yeah. I was about sixteen, around sixteen. DALLETT: Was life there very different than your early childhood? SMALL: Well, I didn't remember moving--the city [. . .] like I was coming to school there, finish grade school, and coming to school down there, and there's college, you know, and the college [. . .] like that; you see, so then most people that are going to help themself there with a [. . .] with a trade; everybody learn a trade. You see, that's what [. . .] college trade, that's a trade. Well, I learned the ship carpenter trade. Ship carpenter. Learned a [shipter], [bailer], [lagger], what you call a [lagger]. There's a big place of John Blackwood, but I work with a smaller company, [C.B. Reeves], he was [C.B. Reeves]. 'Cause my mother, she, she knew, she used to work, she works for the--she's a housekeeper for those people. And then she asked the boss to--you know, recommend--he wouldn't let everybody--so he [turn]--I like the ship carpenter's trade because I used to run a lot of water so I learned the ship carpenter trade. And that's--I worked there for a while, until I almost leave the place. [. . .] John Blackwood, I guess, you ever heard of John Blackwood? DALLETT: Yeah, yeah. SMALL: John Blackwood, That was [the still] there, John Blackwood. And [around us]. DALLETT: So you started off learning that trade, when you were about sixteen? SMALL: That's right. Learned the trade, right. DALLETT: And was it like an apprentice situation? SMALL: Apprentice, that's what I was, I used to be in--the slow, slow season, we had to go and they used to cut down mahogany trees, 'cause they used to make, they used to make mahogany furniture too. You see, so I used to work, and go down and help cut the mahogany trees. And you would have to saw those, two of us get on [. . .] and saw them big, them big trees, and things like that, and keep, you keep community moving, everybody doing something. And the slow season, and the crop season, is when they do cane. Well, And when they finish then, people that don't have no land, work. Well, we never had land. We was--we just was--we didn't have no land. But we--I go to get my mother. She used to work in the city. She was housekeeper for Crawford, he was a big race horse, he own race horse, to Trinidad and Jamaica and all over, and she used to work for him, Jesse Crawford. I remember those. And those days, I don't know, just think [about yourself]. DALLETT: You look back on that period with fond memories? It was a good time? SMALL: Well, I--yes, I think it was very good in [. . .] and I really had a good time. We didn't have no--we used to make our own toys, we used to make toys and all like that, that we used to play with and things like that. But, we never--we didn't have those things and we didn't know about those things and it didn't both you. You make out with what you had and everybody starts out one community. When a certain time, when we lived in the city then afterwards, we was near to the jail, what you call--we call it [Landeri], and at eight-thirty in [Landeri] when the bell ring, everybody playing and [. . .] and then in five minutes, 'cause you have five minutes to where you live. Everybody got off for home then. The bell ring, all us stop playing and cut out for home, never had no problem. If you stay a half hour or so along, the door locked, locked, latch on the door. And you go, you got to knock at the door, your old man says, "What's the matter with you, boys? What was doing over there so long?" So you says, "Nothing," you know, you just make some silly excuse, and you go on in, and when, the third or fourth time, you do the same thing then, you could get a whipping. I mean, a whipping. So that's how we--we never had no problem. DALLETT: Had some people in your family, had some relatives, come to this country? Before you started thinking about it? SMALL: Oh yeah, I had relatives over here. My aunt. They had--the Jackmans. They was the Jackmans. Barry, Jim, you'll meet the Jackmans-- DALLETT: They had come to Massachusetts? SMALL: They live in Boston, Roxbury, yeah. Boston. They had, they had a handful of relatives there, so you used to, they used to keep contact, keep in contact. Well, when after all the people die out, then we lose--I lose track of them. Now I don't even know where they're at now. Just still in Boston, things like that. But in those days, we used to keep in touch with each other. Each year would come over and anything that happened, any [feud] or any big affair, wedding or anything, we would always come over. 'Cause you remember [. . .] he come over for the funeral; I think you drive the car; you the one who drives the car, yeah. DALLETT: And, how long did you apprentice, as a ship carpenter? SMALL: Oh, about ten years or so. Ten years. See, 'cause they keep you there a long time, 'cause see, you have to give them service, and after you--then you can work, then you have to give him some time, 'cause he's--he learn you, for what you say, for nothing. In the way I understand that now. Them days, I couldn't understand it. I couldn't understand why you couldn't leave and go and you wouldn't get a job unless he give you approval. But then after you stay around a certain length and then you can go on your own as journeyman, then, you see. But you have to give him a certain amount of time, your time, you see. DALLETT: And what kind of ships were you building? SMALL: We building a--we build a one-and-a-half mast, schooners. Schooners. And then the most thing there was, that work, we built most of the time was [lighters]. [Lighters] they bring the coal and things out from the country. The wagon bring the coal, they pull [. . .] then you get on the [. . .] so that was the most thing that was do for them [lighters]. 'Cause you see up there then was at the water works, and the water works use a lot of coal, with the pumps and things like that, so then that's what-- DALLETT: So they're mostly ships that would take materials around the island? SMALL: Yeah, [lighters], yeah, they call them [lighters], right. DALLETT: And then did you go on to become a journeyman? SMALL: Yes, yes, I worked afterwards. I became a journeyman. But still they wouldn't pay much money, so then I would leave them after Cuba. I leave them after Cuba on the-- DALLETT: What made you decide to go to Cuba? Why Cuba rather than somewhere else? SMALL: Well, Cuba was at that time, there was--this was the only place you could go, 'cause you see, Cuba had big plantations. [. . .], sugar, [. . .] all those big plantations. And there was a [. . .] sugar, all those kids around there. [. . .] and them places. So everybody go there then, you see, you could get a job on the plantations, cutting cane, then, was what called [. . .] 'cause they was Spanish, they really [. . .] Spanish to cut cane. But, see, I worked [. . .] I was from the city when you get to the city they call you "city boy," so they don't know nothing about [. . .] I work in the centrifugal with Chinese, where they make the, refine the sugar and thing like that, so I work in there with the Chinese. Chinese, they can work, work naked, yes, 'cause it's so hot there, you work naked, and you--you work, you didn't have no problem. Chinese, they can work, too. Chinese and Japanese, they're hard-working people. Yup. DALLETT: When you went to Cuba, did you travel with friends, with other companions, or did you go off by yourself? SMALL: When I went to Cuba, I went off by myself. No, my mother didn't know where I was for about, what--Cuba, tell her about--three or four months, before I contact her and left a note where I was. So she says she was praying for me; she says she knows I was okay. DALLETT: Why did you not want to let your mother know that you were going--planning [. . .] to Cuba? Would she not have wanted you to go? SMALL: Well, she still was very poor but proud. Still don't want you to leave home. And the place was such a happy leaf--get out to hell, to hell. So I remember my grandmother, she was--my grandma, she was very heavy, and we had a [. . .] and had a big stairs in the back of the house that you used to have to come down. And you got to hold on the railing, to come. I mean, she thinks she was heavy, she got to hold on the rail, so whenever I home and she come down, she call me and tell me, "Come on, love," and I know, when she called me once, she wanted to come downstairs. Come downstairs. So, I said, "Granny, if I ever work, the first hundred dollars I save. I'm going to have this place fixed." So she said, "Go ahead, boy, you ain't gonna remember." I said, "Oh." So, sure enough, when I went to Cuba, well, I must be had a little over a hundred dollars, but I sent home money, a hundred dollars, to fix those back steps. So, my godfather, he was a contractor, you know, he used to work [. . .] and the rainy season, the back of the place used to be always a leak. And there was just fixed the front where they have to sleep, but then [. . .] the back, so, I remember I sent the hundred dollars, and she says after, "Love sent a hundred dollars and don't tell my godfather, to fix the [. . .]" So, he want her to fix the front first, maybe, be better think--it was leaking. But she wouldn't let them fix that. She make them fix them stairs that she had to come down. "Cause she said [. . .] send the money to fix those stairs and they got to be fixed first. And she sit down there, and my godfather fixed the stairs. She says, "Well, you got enough money to--See, let me see--" She say, "My rent," she say, "No, you 'gone fool me." She won't let him work unless--I remember that [. . .] Say, she sit down there till they fix them stairs that she had to come down. And then after that then they could do what they want. DALLETT: She knew that's what you wanted to have done. SMALL: Yes, that's what--she set him up, yeah. So, those things bring fond memories, to know that--she also used to tell me, "You never gonna want for nothing." And she's right. I don't really ever want, seriously, [about] so much. So. DALLETT: So your grandmother sort of wished you well on your travels. SMALL: Oh yeah, granny, she was always for me. DALLETT: What age was it, then, that you went off to Cuba? SMALL: I went to Cuba about, I think it was around, twenty, around twenty, yeah, around twenty or so. DALLETT: And were many young men going off to Cuba at that time? SMALL: Well that was the only outlet we had. Everybody went to Cuba. Outlet--they see--they give you--you didn't have to pay, but you see, you were, what you call it--I forget what they call it--but you go there, but you have to stay on the plantation to work a certain length of time to pay them back for their time. DALLETT: For the voyage, you mean. SMALL: Yeah, yeah, and then after you spend a certain length of time, then you were released, you could sign off. So I spend the time and then I start on my own, then. DALLETT: How long were you in Cuba, then? SMALL: A couple of years. About two years or so. I was up on--I was up on, I start from Jucaro, then [Ilicia], then [Feya], then [San le Grande], and come on down. I worked different places coming down, 'cause I didn't have money enough to get long transportation, so I just go work these plantation for a few days. Well, then I did cut cane then. Work on these [. . .] called [kinseel], and every ten days it would pay. And if you work, you work ten days and that's long enough because your feet are [traveling], so then you work on down till you get down to city. That's how it was. DALLETT: And what happened next? SMALL: Well, after I get to the city, then I start learning things about what I've got to do, 'cause then you, you [. . .] and learned, and they didn't hire, they wouldn't give colored jobs on that trade--you only could work good-- DALLETT: There was shipbuilding? SMALL: Yes. DALLETT: But you couldn't get the jobs? SMALL: You get--[. . .]--but, they give you a job, but then, after you work for about a few weeks, they'll start coming after you for a union card. You see, you if you didn't have a union card, they tell you, "Bring your union card," after you done a certain amount of work. I mean, they get the work done because you were [. . .] and carpentry, and things like that. But, your work was [medium/needed], but after you get a little, then they want to lay you off, then they ask you for a union card. Well, you didn't have a union card, so-- DALLETT: You couldn't get a union card. SMALL: No, you couldn't get a union card. So then I had to-- DALLETT: Even with all your experience, your training? SMALL: No, no, they tell you, they don't give a--I forgot how to put it, but it's Spanish, that they won't give you the union card, no, not colored. When they rush, they give you job, 'cause they want you, then they let you work. But as the season's over, then you back. So then I came up the trail, I give up that, then I start looking further employment. DALLETT: Did you think of going back to Barbados then? SMALL: No, no. I never--it never entered my thought, going back to--no. DALLETT: So, where did you decide to go? What did you decide to do, when you couldn't get your union card? SMALL: Well, I, first I started as a cook. 'Cause I learned to cook on the boat, too. So, I started as a cook. And work for Davenport. I used to get a job from the employment office, and I went to Livingston Manor. Livingston Manor and I worked there, Davenport, he had a, he was a professor, and he had a--what you call it--studio there, that you would go and pick all kinds of little bees and things like that, and he used to analyze those, he was a professor there, and along those lines. So then I got the job there, a job cooking there, for a while. So I worked there till the season over, but then the heat didn't agree with me, and I stopped, start looking for further employment, then start going to school, picking up this and that. Till I get married and had kids, and then I, that's how I break up then. DALLETT: Well, sorry, I got a little confused. You said you started to cook but was that in Cuba, or was that here? SMALL: Well, that was here. That's in Cold Spring Harbor. I worked in Cold Spring Harbor. [. . .] and Professor Davenport was there, in Cold Spring Harbor. DALLETT: Take me back to the time in Cuba when you couldn't get your union card. Why was it you decided to come to the United States? Or how did that--how did you do that? How did that work? SMALL: Well, I--up in the country there, you work there, but afterwards, I had saved up some money, and being I used to run the waterfront, I went round the waterfront, and I see a captain, a couple of captains that I knew. And they was on strike then, and they needed help. So which mean that men that they know they walk, but they leave the boat, so the boat then was lay up there, and they needed help. So, now, I got lucky enough to get a job there, working as a mess boy. Mess boy, who serves the officers. So I got a job as mess boy. But, I got that job through the captain. I knew the captain from working on boats. Ordinarily, [. . .] I worked on that boat, but that boat was there, and I talked to him, and he say "Yes, I remember when I was up [. . .] with Harris." I say, "Well, I worked with you," so he give me a job. So, then I--but then he give I--but still I had to get--'cause, you see, a traveling--how you--the traveling papers. So, you hand the captain a story, you had no papers, nothing, in other words, you didn't have nothing to identify yourself. So then you had to--and they have no [. . .] to mess with the English [. . .] 'Cause you couldn't travel if you didn't have the right papers. So then I applied. I went to the English consul, and that was a job. They had people down there, record people, all the time. Always hanging around there, trying to get--and he [. . .] about four a day or so, but still they [apply to go there for weeks], so have 'em--I was always the last, for some reason. I run into one, as far as I know, I work on--I had to work on the boat with him. And he, he tell me, he tell me what to do. So I just take my pass--I didn't have no passport, I take some fake papers, letters I had and have that in my hand so when I went to the consul, I had these in my hand, so he looked at--he didn't look at the papers, he let me through with the papers, and he says, "You go on in." So they only take about four, and you stay there all day. Well, then you're going then, he was very nice, he was [for after] you getting them consul and things. They didn't--they was very nice. So, then he signed the papers, he wrote and signed the papers, and I had my passport, I could travel. DALLETT: We're just going to turn the tape over. This is the end of side one of interview number 196. END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE DALLETT: This is the beginning of side two of interview number 196 with Mr. Lyle Small. So, you were telling me about how it wasn't too difficult to get the papers from the English consul, and what happened after that? SMALL: After I got the papers then? DALLETT: Yeah. SMALL: Well, then I could travel then. You see, there was a strike on so I got a job though the strike was on; at least I was one of the strike breakers. So, when, you know, the strike on, the men walk away, and I was a [strike], so then he, he sometimes, kick you back. I mean, I got the job then. And work on the boat. DALLETT: Just out of curiosity, why were the workers on strike at that point? SMALL: They wanted to stop [people] from joining the union. Then the unions came in, then unions, they starting them unions. After all, this was the unions, 'cause, you see, them days we used to work twelve hours and twelve hours was the limit, most of them, everything, work was twelve hours. So the union take over, they wanted eight hours, they get more overtime then, you see, 'cause when you work eight hours all--you have to work longer than that, you get overtime. Not time. DALLETT: So before you came on board, it was a union job that the other men had? And they were striking for-- SMALL: They were striking. DALLETTE: Eight-hour day-- SMALL: The strike, it wasn't union, the strike to get in the union. You see, it wasn't unionized then. There wasn't no union. But, the CIO and Lewis and them all, different unions, and they was broadcasting and everything, telling the people to strike, don't work for more than eight hours, and blah blah blah, because it was making more [trouble] and all that. So I was like a strike breaker then. DALLETT: How did you feel about that? SMALL: Survival's for the fittest. Life is a chance, and [the way I see] what's good for one hurt's the--the one, but see, everybody was trying to do the best they can. See, nothing was wrong with that; they do it right now still. So. DALLETT: So, it was a good opportunity for you. SMALL: That was my opportunity, yeah. That's right. DALLETT: So tell me more about the ship. SMALL: Well, they--nothing much to--I work on the boats, then I--after, I was [. . .] mess, and I worked there, [. . .] came here. Worked, when I came here, then I got off the boat and I [went] Wall Street. And, 'cause then I, see I--one mistake I did make, see you always bring your young 'uns, make do. When I got off the boat, I didn't, I supposed to sign, sign off, but the--see I just be anxious to get [. . .] go down to the office and sign off the boat, you just get off the boat. You see, it's legal, but we just get off the boat. So then, final, then afterwards, then you have to go back and, get back on line, and sign in them boats, and then, you could, if they want to reject you, they could still reject you and send you back where you come from just the same. 'Cause you do your [job]. The courts makes you call your like--make like you jumped the boat. You see. But, they all [. . .] do that. They understand all of that, so. So I didn't have no problems then. I got the papers signed and everything. So then I was legally here then. Didn't have no problems. DALLETT: What was the name of the ship that you were traveling on? SMALL: Ice King. DALLETT: Ice King? SMALL: Ice King. That's the name of the boat, Ice King. DALLETT: So it wasn't like one of the lighters that you had worked on and built before. SMALL: No, no, this is a big--this is a boat. This is an ocean liner, Ice King. That was a--what it used to--I think it used to bring beef, and things like that. One of these big--bring beef from Brazil and all up in there, yeah. DALLETT: Did you make a trip home? At all? To say good-bye to your family? Before you left? Before you left Cuba? You didn't go back to Barbados? SMALL: No. No, no, no. I didn't get back to Barbados. I didn't get back to Barbados until I established myself here and everything, and then I make the trip. I make the trip--different trips there a lot of times, not until I established myself. DALLETT: And, did you, did your mother and your grandmother know that you would be taking for the United States from Cuba or did you let them know that later? SMALL: No, they knew that afterwards. I didn't--when I leave, I didn't tell no person, no one, where I was going. DALLETT: Did you travel with any friends? Any other companions? SMALL: No, I traveled by myself. I really was by myself. I--for some reason, I don't know, I fall in line by myself. What happened, though, being I used to work on the boats, [one of] the sailors wanted to--the same boat that I came on--I knew him, and he tell me, "You can stay on the boat, you can stay on the boat, they'll take you. You don't have to tell no person." So, I stood there, I didn't tell no one nothing, so that's how I leave. You see- DALLETT: Had you been thinking for a while, before you made the trip, that you would come to the United States? SMALL: Well, I'd think I would like--not I would come; I would like to, because I have a relative lived in Boston and everything. But they are--they promise my mother that they would help me but after they get here everybody been looking for themselves. You see, so they didn't bother. So, but I came anyway. I visit them; we were still--at least we're relatives, we still visit each other [. . .] DALLETT: What kind of things had you heard about what life was like in the United States? SMALL: Well, most people that came back and visit, they used to tell you, you know, they wouldn't tell you, but you see, you just get the idea on your own impression how they're dressed up and the things they're having, think that they was making it very well. They didn't tell you, it just [. . .] a certain way. But still they had to get work. But there you couldn't get no work, not no work. So, thing is, we used to take it on our own that they used to make it so easy, so the money come in easy. That we believed that ourselves, they didn't tell us that. DALLETT: Tell me, how were they dressed differently, or what did they have that made you think that they were-- SMALL: Well, they were dressed nicely, they had nice suits and things like that. [Here] you dress, but not very nice. DALLETT: So you thought it would be a bit easier, here? SMALL: We thought it was easier here, and it was easier in some respects. It depends on who you are, and who you come in contact with. And how you start up. DALLETT: did you get any letters, yourself, from the relatives that you had in Massachusetts? SMALL: Oh yes, we contacted each other afterwards, yeah. After I was established, we contacted. They used to visit us, this and that; they used to visit us, yeah. DALLETT: I mean, while you were still in Cuba. SMALL: Oh no, not--no. DALLETT: So you didn't have their address. SMALL: No, not in Cuba, no and I wasn't established then, I was just a [. . .] sailor, I was just trying to establish myself, see what the hell. Sometimes I was young then, I wasn't married or nothing like that, so I didn't have no, no address or nothing like that. DALLETT: Did you hesitate at all before you took that boat to the United States, or did you just think, "This is my opportunity"? SMALL: No, no, I didn't take the second thought. I just--the opportunity [ hit it], and I didn't take, then, I leave, didn't tell my parents, didn't tell no one. The captain, I had no one there, the officers and he knew me. But, 'cause I--being I used to work on the boat. And he knew me, and he tell me, "If you want us to get board, get--you don't have to tell nobody." So that's what I done. I didn't need to tell no one. Was the boat six weeks or so, and my mother didn't even know where I was. No one know. So. DALLETT: How about when you came into the harbor? Did you--you came through Ellis Island, right? SMALL: Oh yeah, I came through Ellis Island. DALLETT: Tell me what happened there. SMALL: Well, that's funny--you have to, when you come to Ellis Island, you have to get in line. There was a line. A lot of people are there. Didn't have no one to represent, and they would be stranded there. At Ellis Island. But if you have the credentials, then you passed through. Well, I had credentials, I was working; [was I had] credentials, so I had no problem. I just passed through; take about couple of hours, you know, the different papers, sign, and things like that. So I was passed on through and had no problem there. Only one mistake I make so I [action] to get here, I supposed to sign, to go back to the office, and sign now, but I didn't sign, so, but I landed here just the same. So then, when I want my credentials, then I had to go and sign. Then I got the papers all right, though. Because I told them, the day that I came, the boat name, and everything, and once you had those things, then you had them everything. And they must checked the record and find out. You do that, and they have no--don't give them a story, then they know you have--your records is there, so then I didn't have no problems. No, I didn't have no problems. But, that--you know--that sounds so easy, that we still have to get the lawyer to [write] some papers in there. To represent you. A mouthpiece, you gotta always have a mouthpiece, you yourself can't do anything. DALLETT: But you could handle it for yourself? SMALL: Well I did, I did. So far. DALLETT: Did you go through some sort of examination? Did they ask you questions about what you plan to do? SMALL: Oh yeah, they ask you a lot of questions. They not trying to get--but, they asked if you have any money. You gotta have money. So, I had some money, so I tell them what money, I don't remember what it was, but I had to have some money. 'Cause I work on the boat so I naturally have money. I didn't--so I tell them I had money. I think [. . .] in the bank or something. But anyway, I did have it. So once you have a certain amount, there wasn't no problem. DALLETT: And, was Ellis Island crowded with many other people coming in? SMALL: Oh yeah, oh yes, Ellis Island, in them days. They's different layers, and there's people all, from over the world there, in Ellis Island. Some, you talk to some of them, and they being there for two and three weeks, some of them. Before--because it take time before, because [of the time] you lose unless you have a representation somewhat. So. DALLETT: And did someone sort of point you in the right direction, to show you where to go, and which line to get in, and all that sort of thing? How did you find your way through the maze of it? SMALL: Well the main thing is, they have signs and things, and tell you, and you see, there's one thing they was very particular about, too, illiteracy. You have to read and write, be able to read. See, if you couldn't read, then you were lost, 'cause you can't get around, always tell you that. You see, and they check you for that, you see. If you couldn't read, then you're lost, 'cause you don't know, you can't travel about so much. DALLETT: Did they give you something to read, to test to see that you could read? SMALL: Oh yeah, when you--they'd give you a--oh, no, only when they give you something, tell you to take for your citizenship, but them there, they give you nothing to read. They leave it for you. 'Cause if you couldn't read, you couldn't get around. The only time they give you something to read, when you take your citizenship. Then they check, to see if you can read, then. But that was a long time after that, you see. DALLETT: Did you have any sort of medical inspections? Did you see any doctors on Ellis Island? SMALL: Oh, well, they give you--the vaccinate, the vaccinate, they give you vaccination. But I think it was on the boat, I have vaccination on the boat. So I didn't have to have those things, no. Never at Ellis Island, no. 'Cause in them days it was for smallpox. [Car], and things like that. So you had to have a vaccination. Well, I still got my vaccination, look, my first vaccination, 'cause they take [old/all/whole] needle and they scratch. They scratch--look, it's still there. Very different now, they don't get even a mark on you like that. But I still got my first vaccination, that's a long time. DALLETT: Did you find that it was easier for you, since you spoke English, was it easier for you than it might have been for some other people who came from Europe who didn't speak the language? SMALL: Yeah, that was a handicap to some extent. Have to speak English, you see. 'Cause English is the universal, and when you speak English, you have a better chance. You see, 'cause, you see, other people that couldn't speak, then they have to have interpreters and that takes a little more complicated, see. But if you speaks English, things is all better. DALLETT: So did you think you got any kind of special treatment because you could communicate easily? SMALL: No, no special treatment, no. DALLETT: How did the officials treat you? SMALL: Well, they treat you like, I mean, they treat you, oh, ordinary. They didn't give you no--they didn't put no blocks, no stumbling blocks there--they had to tell you to do something, they ask you question, if you could answer them correctly, okay. If you don't answer it correct, then you wasn't coming through all right all along, like that. Even if you working. If you don't follow rules, then you, you got pushed aside. [That's even when] you're working [everyday], working. DALLETT: Were you nervous about not passing through, or did that not bother you? SMALL: Yes, you got to be nervous. If you didn't get nervous, you wouldn't be a human being! Yeah, you got to be nervous. 'Cause you don't want to go back, and you know you [got to] get nervous. DALLETT: So, you spent just a few hours there. On Ellis Island. SMALL: Yeah, it take a couple of hours to pass through, yeah. DALLETT: Did they feed you, give you a meal and all? SMALL: No meals or nothing, not when you're passing through like that, no. No meals, I didn't have. In fact, [. . .] get food, I don't want to be bothered with meals or nothing, because. DALLETT: And, was there some point where finally an official said, "Fine, you're through"? SMALL: Yeah, you pass through the line. There's a line and you got to certain procedures to take, and you just follow the crowd, just follow your nose, and then, whatever they tell you to do, you do it correctly, you just pass right on. That's all. Okay, [papers and all]. DALLETT: And, where were you going to go, when you got off of Ellis Island? What were your plans then? SMALL: Well, I had a friend there, that I came to--I can't remember--[Rena the name]--I know people there. So, I went to their house, and I stay there. DALLETT: Where were they living? SMALL: 137th Street. DALLETT: Do you remember what your first impressions were of New York, when you just came off of Ellis Island, and you were going to have to find your way up to 137th Street? SMALL: First, look like a big--I don't know--you couldn't, you can't imagine when your first impression, 'cause you see, you're not seeing that many people and subways and things. You're confused and lost. But then, someone did take me around a little. You see, he take me, show me different things, and jobs, and take me to jobs, and things like that. And the people in them days used to take a little time to help you. 'Cause you need a little help. If you didn't get help, you'd be confused. You see, so. DALLETT: I don't think I asked what year was it that you came through. That you came to this country. SMALL: 1921, wasn't it? I leave home in 1921--I think it was in 1921. DALLETT: So you were about twenty-three years old? Yeah. SMALL: Yeah, something like that. That's right, well, in that area. DALLETT: So was it a surprise to your friends when you appeared on their doorstep? SMALL: Well, they're always surprised to see someone from where you was born, you know. Well, I mean, they always give you a good welcome and people was more, well, understandable in those days, not heart-hearted like--now, people are more hard-hearted. Well, the people--the conditions around make people like that. But people were more friendly, they would take time off and take you around and show you different things. Or take you on a job, there was take--if they had to stay home a day, and they could afford to stay home, and didn't have no obstacle--they take a day off, and take you around, and help you look for a job. Yeah. DALLETT: Was there a community around 138th Street of people who had come from Barbados? SMALL: Yeah, there was a lot of friends who lived in the neighborhood, yeah. You see, these people that stick together. Everybody live around a certain neighborhood, yeah. DALLETT: So was it difficult for you to get adjusted to New York at that point? SMALL: No, I don't think it was difficult to get adjusted. Just confused most, more than anything else. You want to get--once you want to get--you try hard to adjust yourself to conditions, but they're a little more confused, 'cause you see, you didn't used to such a large area, and so many people, and coming in contact with so many--so you had to get yourself adjusted a little to those things, you see. And then, trusting people. You see, you were--people would come and then they used to warn you, and tell you, people would come and try to con you, for money, and different things like that. And you have to be very careful, 'cause you see, everybody looking for something for nothing. And you find out there's nothing for nothing. And [. . .] My grandfather used to tell me, "There's nothing for nothing, boy, and very little a dollar." So he used to always tell me, when I tried, he said, because they used to tell me what [pantomime] the people doing [pantomime] and things like that. And say, "Realize you don't get nothing for nothing. Some person want to give you something for nothing, refuse it. 'Cause he wants something for that." He's not going to give you--he can't afford to give nothing for nothing. He wants something for that. So if you leave it alone, if you don't want it, just refuse, 'cause it's a come-back [con man?]. He used to always say, "Nothing for nothing, and very little for a dollar." DALLETT: Did you follow his advice, or did you sort of fall into the trap a little bit in the beginning? SMALL: Well, I don't think I got--'cause you see, the point is, I--well, we was around a lot of people's coming in from Panama. And, we had a lot of advice, tell you advice, like don't do this, and don't do that. And white folks was nothing but "don't." I always tell ya, "Don't do this," and "Don't do that," don't-- DALLETT: Can you remember a few examples of, like, a few "dont's"? SMALL: Well, [. ..] I remember, I live 140th Street. And the post office was near the 140th Street. And them days, you used to put your money in the post office. And for some reason, I don't know, look like those people--I think later on in life I think of those. Those people used to come in them place and stay in them place and watch you. And follow you for miles around. See, you know, 'cause I remember once, I went to 140th Street, that time you used to put your money in the post office, so I went to 140th Street to draw some money out, to put it in the bank from the post office. And, after I got in the train, like, you know, sometime you get a, you get a feeling, you get like something--and didn't feel right. So then afterwards, directly then after that, a guy came up and asked me some address. Address. So I said, "I don't know." He says, "I don't know no address by that name, I can't help you." So, he didn't say no more to me. So when I got off the train, another guy, he come and ask me for an address, for some address, or something like that. And I tell him, and it happened the cop was right there, when I get off, 140th Street, post office is right--cop was--I tell him to leave, the cop, or I call, I holler for the officer. Then the guy wanted--so when I hollered for the officer, the two fellows--I didn't even know there was two of them together--both of them, see both [. . .] so then I know what was up. Tried to con me some way or the other. See, they used to con you some way or the other, and get you upset, and then they want to give you something for nothing. And that's--my grandfather used to always tell my grandmother, "Nothing for nothing and very little for a dollar." So them used things used to stay in my mind. DALLETT: What was the first job that you got, once you got established here? SMALL: The first job I got was a--my first job, working, pepper-pot restaurant down in the Village. DALLETT: Pepper-pot restaurant? SMALL: In Greenwich Village. I remember that. Yeah. And I worked there for a while, but then the heat, I used to, I was a short order cook, and I used to drink a lot of iced tea, and then, and milk, and then eat. Went to the doctor, doctor tell me [. . .] Didn't stop and the heat was no good for me. I was too small, and the heat was taking an effect, I didn't eat right. So he tell me I have to find something else to do, if you don't you can burn yourself up. So, I find another--find a job. Find another work to do, and I give up cooking then. And start. DALLETT: Tell me about--when did you become a citizen? How many years did that take? SMALL: Oh, it take about ten years, I guess. Good ten years. DALLETT: Did you have to go through a whole procedure to become a citizen? SMALL: Well yes, you have to. Well, the point is you have to--give you books to read. 'Cause they ask you--you never know what they're gonna ask you. You got to [. . .] of different things. You never know, so they give you books and you go through the books and you lucky enough, they might ask you some of the questions that you know. Sometimes they ask you questions you don't know and you have to go back a second time. But lucky enough for me, I, I did answer my own and I didn't have no problem. DALLETT: Can you tell me about the family that you raised here? SMALL: Well, I had three sons. One here, he take law, and he was too serious, he take up in international law, and he want to go to West Indies as a counsel [consul], and he burn himself a little and he died with a heart attack. Burn himself up. DALLETT: Very serious person. SMALL: Well, too serious, 'cause then you burn yourself up. Because I was sick around the time he died, too, I didn't even know it till a long time. I don't know how long, maybe two or three weeks, before--three months--that long? I don't know how long it was. DALLETT: How about your other two sons? SMALL: That's one there. The other one, Carl, Carl, he works for--he runs that old place [restaurant]. DALLETT: Did you ever think about going back to Barbados, or were you comfortable here in the States? SMALL: Well, I did think of going back once, but then, now so far gone, I couldn't make my transition, no. No, I just got to call it quits. DALLETT: Did you get a chance to go back and visit with your family, with your mother and grandmother? SMALL: I went back quite a few times, I went back. Not during when they was living. When I went back there they was gone already. But I went back quite a few times. I leave, I went back got a [. . .] there--what do you call that thing that I got from a man--what is that? The cemetery? Down at the cemetery? Oh, headstone. Oh, I went back and put the headstone and everything, for them. So, I leave them right there. DALLETT: And just one other thing. Can you tell me, did you come by the Statue of Liberty when you first came into the harbor? SMALL: Yes, you had to come--that's the only entrance. You come in, you can't miss it. And everybody want [. . .] the Statue of Liberty; everybody wanted to--you know what I mean, look at it, when you're coming through there. You get and you look at it, see, the Statue of Liberty. It [. . .]--sometimes people even make noise, keep a lot of noise, "ha ha," and all that. When you come to the Statue of Liberty. 'Cause that's the entrance to the United States. When you get there, you know that you entered the United States. DALLETT: I just want to thank you very, very much for telling us your story. SMALL: Well, thank you for what you doing then. If it mean anything, I don't know. DALLETT: It certainly does. That's the end of interview number 196 with Mr. Lyle Small, and it's 10:55.
