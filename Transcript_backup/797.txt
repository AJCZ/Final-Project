CLOUTIER: This is Dennis Cloutier, November 22, 1983, with the Ellis Island Oral History Program [sic]. Today we have an immigrant that came through Ellis Island. And your name is? JACKET: What is? CLOUTIER: Your name. JACKET: Betty Jacket. CLOUTIER: Betty Jacket. And when did you come through Ellis Island? JACKET: In August 20, 1920. CLOUTIER: Where were you born? JACKET: Russia, the Bessarabia. Village by the name Brishabin [ph], Serokiniest [ph]. CLOUTIER: That's the name of the village. JACKET: Brish [ph] was the name of the village where I was born. I left the city Beltz [ph]. Later we moved to a bigger city. The name of the city was Beltz [ph], and from Beltz [ph] we came to America. CLOUTIER: When were you born? JACKET: Where? CLOUTIER: When? JACKET: I told you, I never had birth certificate, so I don't know what. I just know I was the oldest. I must have been about fifteen years when we came to America. CLOUTIER: You said they didn't give birth certificate to ladies. JACKET: Women never had birth certificates. Only men, that had to go for soldiers. So I never know how old I was or what. ( break in tape ) CLOUTIER: So, Betty, when you came through you really don't know how old you were, because you had no birth certificate. JACKET: I was fifteen years of age. CLOUTIER: About fifteen, yeah. Do you remember what port you left from? JACKET: Eh, we went to Roumania from the city of Beltz [ph], no, from the HIAS to Paris. CLOUTIER: Huh. Say it again? From HIAS? JACKET: Paris. CLOUTIER: From Paris? JACKET: To Paris. And there we stayed about three weeks. HIAS kept us there. And then they put us, they got transportation to the America for tickets, and they put us, send us at Ellis Island. The sickness developed there, and we had to remain in Ellis Island for three weeks, quarantiered [sic]. CLOUTIER: Okay. Now, back on the ship, HIAS put you on a ship from Paris to Ellis Island. Now, did you travel in steerage? JACKET: Did we travel what? CLOUTIER: In steerage, down below? JACKET: Yeah, of course. We have to sleep on the bare floor. There was no beds, nothing at all but only what we carried from Europe. We took only a few belongings. CLOUTIER: What did you bring with you? JACKET: Nothing in particular. We brought a couple of pillowcases. There was a blanket. That's what, we had to bring our own food. It got spoiled, but we had to eat it whether we liked it or not. CLOUTIER: Your own food. JACKET: We had nothing else. CLOUTIER: They didn't serve any food on the ship? JACKET: No, not at all. CLOUTIER: How long was your voyage? JACKET: I think about ten days from Roumania to Paris. From Paris I don't remember exactly how long. The ship was a little better. CLOUTIER: Did you get seasick at all? JACKET: Yes, I was seasick. CLOUTIER: Was it a rough journey? JACKET: Very rough, very rough. Practically everybody was vomiting in the morning till night, and they have no place where to rest. They had to lay down on the bare ground. That's all. CLOUTIER: Did you all . . . JACKET: No bath, no (?), nothing at all. CLOUTIER: Did you stay down below most of the time, or did you go up . . . JACKET: There was no other way. Only downstairs, and the (?) was exposed to the air, to the rain, to the wind, whatever it was. It was on a (?) just to get off the floor. CLOUTIER: To do what? JACKET: The ground floor. CLOUTIER: Right. JACKET: The floor, that's all we could sit. CLOUTIER: Were you allowed at all upstairs? JACKET: We couldn't, there was nothing else to do. Just to look up to the open air. It was windy, cold, the rain. So that's what we were getting. CLOUTIER: You said it was a cattle ship, didn't you? JACKET: It must have been. CLOUTIER: It must have been. JACKET: Because there was nothing, no beds, no food, nothing at all. CLOUTIER: Huh. Do you remember how much they charged you for this? JACKET: No, that I don't know. My mother made all that. We were all very young. CLOUTIER: So you traveled with your mother. And how many others? JACKET: Five sisters and a brother. Four sisters and a brother. CLOUTIER: Where was your father? JACKET: My father died a long time ago. We were ten years, I was ten years old when he died, and there were five children younger than me. CLOUTIER: Did you have any friends or relatives here in America? JACKET: Yes. I had my mother's sister was here, and my mother had four sisters and two brothers, and my father had a brother that was well-to-do. So he came and promised that we were not to accept charity. Otherwise they wouldn't let us off of the ship. CLOUTIER: That's right. JACKET: So he got (?) for us. He was well-to-do. He had the real estate to prove it. CLOUTIER: He what? JACKET: Real estate. CLOUTIER: Real estate, uh-huh. JACKET: To prove that he won't, he's in a position to cover if we ever need help. CLOUTIER: To sponsor you. JACKET: That's all we had, yeah. As soon as I came to America, I started to work. We had to arrange our ages, we should be able to go to work. You have to be sixteen years of age before you start to work in America. CLOUTIER: Sixteen? Sixteen. JACKET: So we had to lie wherever we went to get a job. Where was we got a job, we tried to get as many hours as we could put in, to make a little more money. CLOUTIER: Sure. JACKET: The apartment that we got, was no heat, no light. They had to put in a quarter, and if you didn't have a quarter you remained in the dark. CLOUTIER: Really, for the electricity? JACKET: This was in America. CLOUTIER: This was electricity, I guess. JACKET: No electricity. Just light, gasoline, whatever it was. CLOUTIER: Gas, gaslight. JACKET: So we had to be sure that we had quarters to put in, otherwise we remained in the dark. There's no bath, no shower. There was a washtub. The washtub we used for a bath. We would wash the laundry there. Everything goes in there. And to heat the place, you had to bring coals from somewhere. CLOUTIER: Bring what? JACKET: Coal, coal. CLOUTIER: ( misunderstanding Miss Jacket ) Coil? JACKET: To heat the place, to make the stove, should we brought it. There was no electric, steam heat or anything like it. CLOUTIER: Hmm. JACKET: It was the hardest time, you could think. But I didn't like it. So I could work extra time, make extra some money and get a little better apartment. I thought it was so. I did learn my work very fast. I learned a little bit in Europe. They sent me to work at the age of ten. So from the age ten to fifteen I learned a little dressmaking, and there I got a job. Indeed, I was willing to work extra time. I remember the first Christmas, the boss asked me to come to work for him. In the winter I was glad to make a couple more dollars. And a fellow came to take me out and brought me candy. And I wasn't home. So he said, "She's a damn fool. She works on Christmas Eve. Let's open the candy and have a good time." So they had a good time, and the next day they told me about it. I remember I cried a little bit. "I had to work because we need the money, and they considered me a damn fool." ( they laugh ) I was glad. I could work, and not accept charity. That was my pride, until today, we have a big family in Roumania, but whatever we have to send, thank God I put (?). That's all. CLOUTIER: Did your mother work when she came here? JACKET: No. She used to take the five children. How could she work? I was the big one. CLOUTIER: You were the oldest. JACKET: The others were smaller, yes. CLOUTIER: Oh, gee. Who was the youngest? How old was the youngest? JACKET: About twelve. CLOUTIER: Where was your first apartment you were telling me about? JACKET: In the Bronx. Pleasant Avenue, I think they called the neighborhood. It was a very dangerous neighborhood, but we didn't think where it is, so long as we had a place. (?) It was right near the seashore, the East River. To go there was very (?), and people could not afford to have cars. The only people that had cars were thieves and racketeers. CLOUTIER: Thieves? Thieves . . . JACKET: Thieves or racketeers. CLOUTIER: Racketeers, uh-huh. JACKET: But when they made on top of somebody, they grab the car away. That was the only car place where they could stop there. And I had to come home eleven o'clock at night in that neighborhood. By the time I (?) on the fourth floor. I'll never forget it. I could have been killed on that floor, walking up. There was no elevator. You had to walk up. And I worked till eleven o'clock at night, it wasn't safe either. And it was black. But a lot of people would be (?), but they couldn't do it. But I know (?). So this was my charmer, my young days in America. And thanks God today I could help anybody that needs it, that's all. CLOUTIER: Do you remember much about your stay on Ellis Island once you got here? JACKET: There was all right, on Ellis Island. They give us good food. The place was nice and clean. I remember the first coffee they gave me and the fresh roll. I never tasted such a good thing. CLOUTIER: The coffee? JACKET: A fresh roll and a cup of coffee. ( Mr. Cloutier laughs ) In Europe they didn't have coffee. They had secordia [ph], that was cheap. That's what they did. They have no sugar. They had candy. They couldn't afford to buy sugar. And if they wanted, they used to pass by white beets. They took it somewhere to make sugar out of it, so if a beet fell off, we were lucky to grab it and cook it, we had sweet water. And that was instead of tea. This was, you never realize the hardship the people went through in Europe at the time, to get into the Nev York. Till today they call it Nev York. Not New York, but Nev York. CLOUTIER: Nev York. Did you hear much about Ellis Island before you came, rumors? JACKET: Yeah, everybody that came to America had to stop. But there was a luxury already that was a nice house, and good food. Except we couldn't get out, because we couldn't, contagious disease, spread the disease. We had to stay in our rooms. CLOUTIER: You were, you stayed on Ellis for how long? JACKET: About three weeks. CLOUTIER: About three weeks. Because of a contagious disease on the ship? Do you know what it was, at all? JACKET: No, I don't know what it . . . CLOUTIER: They wouldn't tell you, I guess. JACKET: I think it was typhus fever, but I don't know. CLOUTIER: Typhoid fever. JACKET: Yeah. It wasn't my family. There was one family that was sick, the mother's cousin. The fact is, she only died short on medication a couple of weeks after. But being he was weak I think contracted and died. CLOUTIER: Hmm. I wonder if he caught this on Ellis Island. JACKET: Hmm? CLOUTIER: I wonder if he caught this on Ellis Island. ( he pauses ) When you were processed on Ellis Island, do you remember much about that? JACKET: No, they didn't ask me anything. I was young. They asked my mother, and whatever answers she gave that man. CLOUTIER: Right. Such things as, "Do you have any money? Do you have any sponsors?" Things like this, from . . . JACKET: We didn't, this they had no, because they got the money from Europe for us to bring to Ellis Island, so they know, they had the record of that. Till today I think HIAS is a godsend. CLOUTIER: You what? JACKET: A godsend, the HIAS. Helps everybody. CLOUTIER: The HIAS, yes. JACKET: They are wonderful. And I do try to support them right now, too, because I think they're worth everything at all. CLOUTIER: They are good people. Did you go through a medical inspection yourself? JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: No medical inspections? Do you remember? JACKET: Yes, they looked at your eyes. CLOUTIER: They looked in your eyes. JACKET: Mostly. But thanks God, in my family, nobody was sick. CLOUTIER: They were doing this to everybody. JACKET: Yes, that's a (?). That was a contagious disease. Anybody that had that sickness, (?), they sent them right back. They wouldn't let them get into the United States. That's all I can remember. Of course, I wasn't educated in Europe because I, in particular, wasn't allowed to go to school, because I come from an Orthodox religious family. CLOUTIER: Orthodox religious. JACKET: And we're not allowed to go Saturday to school. I was raised by my grandfather. My grandfather was a soifer [ph]. Do you know what a soifer [ph] means? A soifer [ph] is the one that write The Ten Commandments, very Orthodox religious man. And I was raised on the (?). We were not allowed to do anything. CLOUTIER: No school? JACKET: So we couldn't go to work. We couldn't work on Saturdays. Sunday, yes. Christmas, New Year's, yes, but not, uh . . . CLOUTIER: What did you do in Europe for work? JACKET: Sewing. CLOUTIER: Sewing. JACKET: First I learned dressmaking, then (?). I made it good on both lines. I learned a trade very fast, so I had better chances than any other foreigners that came. They gave me extra work at that time. It was considered a big business. We could make extra the work, and make extra money. (?) So that's it. CLOUTIER: Do you remember if you had any sort of papers or documents? JACKET: Of course. We had a passport, one passport for everybody else. Which means that there wasn't even one sixteen years of age. If there had been in the family one sixteen years of age, they would have to have a separate passport. CLOUTIER: Over sixteen years of age you'd have to have a separate passport, but you didn't. JACKET: No. I still have the passport. My mother had one passport for everybody else. That's what we had. CLOUTIER: Huh. ( he pauses ) What was the first thing you saw in America that was very unusual? JACKET: I really didn't see anything. We were just glad to (?). CLOUTIER: Just glad to be here. JACKET: Hmm. The apartment was a little better than in Europe, but we still, we were used to Europe. We had a big apartment. We have to do everything, there they had no floors. But we want to make it fancy, we used designs. Like here on, say, 59th Street, the people make designs on the street, that's when we make designs on the floors in the rooms, to make it fancy look. And that was a luxury apartment. So. CLOUTIER: Did you stay in the Bronx for long after you moved, came to America? JACKET: Yes, about two or three years, you see. CLOUTIER: And then you moved on into the New York Metro area, elsewhere? JACKET: Oh, we had to move very later. In fact, we had one apartment in the Bronx, thirty-eight years, where my mother lived, because she was religious, and she had to have the synagogue. It was across the way. But I moved out when it got dangerous. They started to kill people going to work in the morning. I moved to Manhattan, but my mother was still there. I used to come every day yet to shop for her, but it was a strain. If you have to go late at night, you're afraid walking center of the street. When a car comes, you could see whether someone attacks you or not. This was the early in America. CLOUTIER: Now, you said the food was very good on Ellis Island. Was there anything that you weren't familiar with, that you saw there for the first time, perhaps? JACKET: We didn't, except we were so poor in Europe, we didn't have anything to eat. When they gave us a piece of meat or a fresh roll, it was a luxury. In Europe we had to bake bread yourself, one day for the whole week, it gets old and stale. And the breakfast, we have a piece of onion and a piece of stale bread. CLOUTIER: Onion and stale bread. JACKET: We couldn't have anything else. And the sugar was so expensive, we couldn't buy sugar. So we used hard candy and a glass of tea. That was the breakfast for everybody else in Europe. For lunch they make a potato soup and a piece of stale bread with potato soup. That was the meal. For dinner they did that meat, got one pound of meat for six days. Less than a half a pound of meat for five, six people. But that was good enough. It was a luxury, still. That's all I could tell you. The hard life they lead, really. Maybe now it's not so bad. Well, thirty, forty years ago it was real bad. This is the life. That's why I say America is luxury, and I'm glad I'm here. CLOUTIER: So why did you leave the homeland? Just for a better, prosperous possibilities, better jobs? JACKET: Yes. Better job, make more money, and that's what we did. We got, but the only thing, my mother had a big family in Europe. We had to send the money to Europe. And my grandfather, he raised (?), is entitled to get all that we could get in America, because he gave me all we could get (?). And I'm very glad, I still have family in Europe to whom I have to send help. CLOUTIER: Did you ever go back to Europe? JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: Never? JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: But you still have communication with them? JACKET: They come, but most of them are in Israel now. I was in Israel three times already. CLOUTIER: Oh, you've been in Israel. JACKET: Three times. CLOUTIER: But you haven't gone back home to Russia. JACKET: No. Russia, when you're there, if you walk out on the street they guide you and they check on you. You shouldn't say anything you shouldn't, you know, and I'm afraid. So I don't come back. If I have to write to them, even a few words, it's very careful. They don't let you go out, through your letters, your words. CLOUTIER: Did you find the people rude on Ellis Island towards you? JACKET: No, they were very, very pleasant. CLOUTIER: Very pleasant. JACKET: Very, very pleasant. CLOUTIER: Were you frightened? Were you scared of the whole process? JACKET: Everything was the best we could think of. CLOUTIER: But you weren't afraid of being sent back for a reason? JACKET: No. We had no reason, except, you know, because there was a sickness, a contagious disease, and we had to stay on Ellis Island. Quarantiered [sic]. CLOUTIER: Quarantined, yeah. But many people got sick on the ship coming over, and you were there for three weeks. Didn't that occur to you that you might be sent back because of something you caught? JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: No? JACKET: We didn't. From the sea, the ship shakes. Most of them throw up practically daily. CLOUTIER: The ship's sheets? JACKET: Yeah, the ship shakes. CLOUTIER: Oh, shakes. Uh-huh. JACKET: So everybody throws up. CLOUTIER: Oh, right, sure. JACKET: That's about all. That's the only sickness, sea sickness. That's what they call it. It's nothing. That wasn't the worst thing. But then from the food we take along from Roumania, it all got spoiled, but we had nothing else to eat, whether it was spoiled or not. For the most part, we had to eat it that way, nothing else to do. CLOUTIER: Sure. Were you traveling with a lot of people? JACKET: Oh, yes. The ship was quite, several other people that got into that ship. CLOUTIER: And on Ellis Island it was even more crowded, right? JACKET: Yeah, we had a apartment. It was a big apartment, just beds one on top of the other. Every person had a bed for themself, which was considered a luxury. So that's it. CLOUTIER: Did your family stay together in one room? JACKET: Yes. The entire family in one room. CLOUTIER: So that wasn't so bad? JACKET: No, it wasn't bad. They arranged it to make a (?), and they make another bed. Three or four beds in the room. And the other side of the bed, the same thing. It was a big family. They gave me a room, four beds, six beds, eight beds, whatever they need. CLOUTIER: Were you impressed by America by looking at the Great Hall in Ellis Island? JACKET: When we came here, we were just glad to get in the house already. I was so sick and tired traveling. And the sister prepared a three-room apartment on the fourth floor. We were glad to get up there, but at night when I start to work you know, that the (?). But I still had to do it. I still remember Pleasant Avenue, close to the seashore, with nothing there, no police, no protection. That's all. (?) And we have a big family in Russia, Roumania. We have to send, in Israel, rather, I send there. (?) CLOUTIER: Do you ever wish they could come to America also? JACKET: Yes, I would like to have them here. But some get used to it. They learn the language there, and I know a cousin of mine came, it's only some of them do come, not in (?), but to make the money. They came from Russia. Russia is a (?) prison, I don't know for what, but when you came into Israel, it's not too happy. He's a lawyer, but he wasn't that, but when he came into America, he didn't come here to live. He just came to bring, a nephew from Russia got sick. He brought him to America to a doctor. He didn't have to bring him, he was too sick to come to America. The cousin had family, so he'll stay here with a family. So in America they put him on relief right away, they gave him the lunches here for a quarter lunch. In Europe they haven't got it. Why couldn't he come back? In the two years that the cousin came that was sick, that he brought him to a doctor, he was here three times already. Now, (?). They gave his place with the family. He got his meals. When I go in Israel, I had to pay for every little thing. So that's about all. CLOUTIER: It was well worth the hardships and the effort to come to America. JACKET: Yes, thanks God. Right now everybody looks up to me, that I should need help everything. CLOUTIER: Do you think your life would have been a lot different if you had stayed in Russia? JACKET: Oh, no, definitely not. CLOUTIER: No, do you think your life would have been different? JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: It would have been the same? JACKET: It wouldn't be different. Of course, I couldn't get a higher education because I didn't have anybody to support me. If I would go to school or to college with the other people they would have gone (?). If I would have gone there, I wouldn't have anything to eat. I have to support the family that was younger from me, so there I couldn't get an education. Here I didn't have any education either. I started working right away. But I used to go to evening school a little bit, I could, we have here all the help we could get, and I'm very glad. CLOUTIER: Did you ever get married? JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: No? Well, anything else you'd like to say about Ellis Island or America? JACKET: This is a wonderful place, that's what I could say. I'll never forget the comfort, the decent meals, the nice people. People were very, very nice. So that's all I could remember. CLOUTIER: Do you think America was better back then than it is now? JACKET: I don't know. I am pleased with America. CLOUTIER: Now, as then. JACKET: Here if I want to work, make my money, I could get it. There I couldn't get it. My mother send me to learn, to teach a trade. I was ten years old. For three years I was forced to work free of charge altogether to learn. The other three years, if I make another three years I'll get ten dollars, but I work a year-and-a-half, my mother need me. So I worked four-and-a-half years for nothing, but I learned a trade, and that came in handy for me. CLOUTIER: That's important. JACKET: Yes. CLOUTIER: Okay. Thank you very much, Betty. JACKET: Thank you very much. CLOUTIER: Now, Betty Jacket, you say your name was not . . . JACKET: It was Yacot [ph]. CLOUTIER: ( mispronouncing her Russian pronunciation ) It was Yukoch [ph]. JACKET: Yacov. Betty Yakut [ph]. CLOUTIER: In Russian. But there is no letters to say that in America. JACKET: No. CLOUTIER: So you had to, you went with Jacket, because it was easier to say. JACKET: It was easier to remember. CLOUTIER: That's right. Well, Betty Jacket, thank you very much. ( they laugh )
