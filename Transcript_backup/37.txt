She lived there and I stayed, stayed with her until I started the job. SIGRIST:What do you remember about your first night in America? ANDERSEN:First night what? SIGRIST:Yes. First night that you were in New York. What do you remember about that? Did anything interesting happen? ANDERSEN:No, I don’t think so. No, I don’t think so. SIGRIST:How long was it before you got your job? Or you had the job. ANDERSEN:I had the job. SIGRIST:When did you start working? Right away? ANDERSEN:August. No. See that time they was a wave to the country. They didn’t come back before in October. So I, I had, I got a job up there, my sister in Tarrytown. Yeah. You know, I, of course, I don’t know how much that they paid me, but when I started my job I had seven dollars a month. Today they, they make seven dollars a minute. Huh? Yeah, seven dollars a month I started with. SIGRIST:Now, where you living in with the family? ANDERSEN:Oh, yes. Oh... SIGRIST:Tell me what your job, what your duties were. What were your duties in the family. ANDERSEN:My sister was waitress. And they had a cook. She was Norwegian. And I was laundry chamber, laundry chambermaid. I done the laundry. And then they had the furnace man. Very fine family. SIGRIST:How did you do the laundry for them in those days? ANDERSEN:Oh, oh, oh, oh, them days had a tub then. You had to boil the clothes in a big boiler on the stove. We had no car-, we had no electric vacuum. I had the carpet sweeper. No, no Hoover or nothing. I used a big broom to sweep the rugs then. SIGRIST:Did a lot of people, Scandinavian people, get work as domestic help like yourself? ANDERSEN:That’s the only thing, yeah, you couldn’t understand the language. But it didn’t take us so long. We went to movies a lot and, and, and, and it wasn’t too long before you understood and could speak English. And then, I don’t know, I was married when I became American citizen. We went for the papers, you know, you wanted to become American citizen. SIGRIST:When you were learning English, and you, did you just pick it up from listening to people around you? ANDERSEN:Yeah. That’s all. That’s... SIGRIST:Do you remember what your first word was that you understood? ANDERSEN:(she laughs) I don’t, well, you get used to, you, you, you pick up pretty fast, you know. And they never made fun of you if you didn’t understood it but you tried to talk, and, and it didn’t take too long before you understood it. Then you started to talk. SIGRIST:Do you, do you remember making a mistake once that was very funny? ANDERSEN:Oh, well, yeah, of course. (she laughs) But they were used to, they were used to Scandinavian in the families. Yeah, they were used to it. SIGRIST:Did you see anything in those, in that first year that you were in America... ANDERSEN:Yeah. SIGRIST:...did you see anything that was new and different that you had never seen before? ANDERSEN:Well, everything seems to be different. We all joined the Norwegian Seamen Church. That was in, in Clinton and First or Third Place. Yeah, we joined the choir there, because we could walk from, from where I worked down Clinton Street down to the church. Yeah, so we al-, al-, always, always go to the Norwegian. Then we joined the choir, the three of us. I was married from this Norwegian Seaman Church, too. SIGRIST:How long after you were that your third sister came over? ANDERSEN:Jenni. I think that was, Jenni came, Jenni and my cousin, the two of them came over. And I think, I, I don’t remember who, who, who took care of Jenni. And my cousin, she had a family. I can’t remember Jenni. But there wasn’t, there was no guarantee at that time. I know I met Jenni on the boat. The Stavangerfjord, it docked on 29th Street, Brooklyn, them days. SIGRIST:And you went right to the dock to pick up Jenni. ANDERSEN:Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. SIGRIST:She didn’t go to Ellis Island? ANDERSEN:No. No. No. No. No. No. SIGRIST:Was there something that you didn’t like about America? Something that was really hard to adjust to? ANDERSEN:We were so happy. No. We, we were happy, I was happy from the first day I came to this country. And it was a different time from today. Yeah. We could go out any time of the evening. I used to stay down Fort Hamilton, waiting for Court Street, twelve o’clock, you know. Nobody bothered. You don’t have to, you didn’t have to be afraid of anything. It was a different altogether comparing to today. Today it had changed. Changed. SIGRIST:Tell me, how long were you here before you met your, your husband? ANDERSEN:Well, the girl, the cook that he had, she knew the family Andersen. And that’s how, how I met my husband, yeah. Mrs. Andersen, she had two girls and two boys. SIGRIST:And what was your husband’s first name? ANDERSEN:Aarling. Aarling. SIGRIST:Aarling. ANDERSEN:A-A-R-L-I-N-G. Aarling. SIGRIST:And what did you, what did you like about him? What attracted you to him when you first met him? ANDERSEN:Well, he was, he was, I had so, I had lots of boyfriend. You went out all the time, always someone, but he was the one that I liked. SIGRIST:Was he Norwegian? ANDERSEN:His parents were, but they were all born in this country, the children. Oh, yes. SIGRIST:And what year did you get married/ ANDERSEN:I think in ‘29, I think. SIGRIST:So you’d been here for a while before that happened? ANDERSEN:Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes. SIGRIST:Did you ever try to get your parents to come over to America? ANDERSEN:Well, later years when my father died, and it was just, just, my father and mother and died, I had one sister left. And we always wanted her and her husband to come over. Either as, they, they would have to, they went to, they would have to go to California. My sister was there, yeah. And my sister said, ‘If I knew that I would have it better in America that what I have it here, I’ll come.’ Yeah. So, you know, we had it good in Norway. SIGRIST:Tell me what it was like to study to become a citizen. ANDERSEN:To become a citizen? SIGRIST:Yes. What, what was the process that you had to go through? ANDERSEN:Well, you, you plan to stay in this country, you know, you should become a citizen. Of course, you never forget Norway. That’s one thing. No. But everybody had to, to go for their papers. And we all went. SIGRIST:Was there like a class that you attended, you know, a group of people? ANDERSEN:No. You could buy those small books that you could read, and, and all the questions that they would ask you, you know. And I had, I had one witness. My sister-in-law. She was a witness. Didn’t take long. SIGRIST:Were you already married by the time you became a citizen? ANDERSEN:Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. SIGRIST:Was that an exciting moment for you when you became a citizen? ANDERSEN:Well, I was proud to be an American citizen. And everybody was, you should be. Being in this country and plan to stay there, you should become an American citizen. Yeah. SIGRIST:Tell me about the first time you went back to Norway. ANDERSEN:Oh, oh, oh. SIGRIST:What year was that? ANDERSEN:Was that then the ‘25, and ‘50, and ‘60? I was there three times. But I know, you know, I do forget, you know. Can’t help it. SIGRIST:You had been in this country for several years before you went back? ANDERSEN:Yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. I don’t know if that was in ‘25. When I went over in ‘50, and in the sixty, ‘69. SIGRIST:Well, tell me about the first time you went back, and what it felt like to be back in Norway. ANDERSEN:It was the same. My sister was there, and my mother and father, and it was always nice to go back. Yes. SIGRIST:Did you feel an emotional connection when you went back? Or did you feel kind of removed from it? ANDERSEN:Well, oh, they were all crying. They were all crying. So glad to see each other. Sure. SIGRIST:Did they look different to you, somehow older to you maybe, or... ANDERSEN:Well, my sister was grown up from the time I left, and didn’t take notice much about age. No. They were there. There was my father and there was my mother and that’s about all. You never looked at age, so what they looked like. They were all kind and good. SIGRIST:So you got married in 1929. And you married Mr. Andersen. ANDERSEN:Hmm-hmm. SIGRIST:I never did ask you what your maiden name was. What was your maiden name? ANDERSEN:Ernstsen. SIGRIST:Can you spell that? ANDERSEN:E-R-N-S-T-S-E-N. SIGRIST:Great.

ANDERSEN:No. No. No. No. No. We went to Cal-, California almost every second year, because my husband worked for the railroad. And when he got free, free tickets, so almost every second year we went to visit my sister in Oakland. Yeah. SIGRIST:Do you still speak Norwegian? ANDERSEN:Do I? SIGRIST:Do you still speak a little Norwegian? ANDERSEN:Oh, I’ll never to, not to talk Norwegian. Never. SIGRIST:I, I’d like it very much if we could get you on tape saying some Norwegian. Is there a prayer or a Christmas carol or something that you know in Norwegian that we could get on tape? ANDERSEN:Yeah. SIGRIST:What would you like to, or could you sing for us... ANDERSEN:(she laughs) No... SIGRIST:...a Norwegian song? ANDERSEN:Oh, I like to sing, but I don’t have that voice.

ANDERSEN:Well, you went fishing, and you, you got fish, and you named who they were for. But the one that really done the rowing and the fishing, he got two. (she laughs) SIGRIST:Oh, that’s wonderful. I think that probably a good place to, to end. (she laughs) Mrs. Andersen, thank you very much for letting pose some questions.
