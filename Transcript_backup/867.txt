Uh, we had bad times. People had bad time over there. One day all the Arabs, Turks, Turkish Arabs, came. And they tried to kill the, kill all the orphans. We have the song on that. When you sing, I used to sing and I used to cry about that. They want to take everything they had in the house there. And they want to, oh, kill all the orphans there. In Haleb, such a big place, they were so strong that they were able to do this kind of things. Imagine that? OFLAZIAN: Very cruel. KEBAJIAN: And they had the song. Every day the orphans, every day they sang, and they used to cry, especially persons like, you know, some persons have no feeling. But some of them, they feel it through, in their hearts.

OFLAZIAN: How? How did you come out? KEBAJIAN: I think, I don't remember if we were in or not. I don't know. My mother was living there. She got sick. She had the cholera. And there was no, there was no hospital. They took them to the Turkish, the Turkish hospital, only one hospital, for so many. And I wish you, you live long there. One day I went to the hospital to see my mother. My Agavnyr sister, the big one, told me to go down and see Mother and, not very far from the orphanage. And I went there, the nurse, Armenian nurse was there. She said, I said, "How is my mother?" I don't know what she tell me. And she said, "She died." I don't know, I don't know, I did not know what that word is, see? "She died," she says. I didn't know the word. But remind me, like, like, "She cannot come back no more." That word came. I went home, I went home and . . . END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO OFLAZIAN: This is Grace Oflazian. We are resuming now the interview with Mrs. Kebajian. Mrs. Kebajian, so you visited, you just said that you visited your mother in the hospital and the nurse said that she died. So you stood alone. Now, where did you go, or what happened? KEBAJIAN: I don't remember where I went, but I know I found Agavnyr and I told Agavnyr that she's, the nurse told me she died. And I guess she understood a little, she got something out of that word, or ask somebody what does that mean. (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for die. KEBAJIAN: (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: Mrs. Kebajian is explaining in Armenian how her mother died. KEBAJIAN: Right away I remember that when she died means when anybody is not speaking, cannot walk, cannot drink, cannot, I said speak, that means dead. So that's how I explained to my sister.

Mrs. and Mrs. Aronian used to take care of us. OFLAZIAN: How did you come to America? KEBAJIAN: ( she pauses ) How I came? OFLAZIAN: To America.

OFLAZIAN: From where you took the boat to come to America? KEBAJIAN: Where we . . . OFLAZIAN: Did you take the boat from Haleb? KEBAJIAN: Some, no, no. Some friends at that time, they were going to go. I don't know who she asked. My sister must be asking, I don't remember those. But my sister Agavnyr, I think she asked all the people, Armenian friends or if they know each other who go. Like group, groups, they eat together, they sleep together, and they have each other. That time was very helpful. OFLAZIAN: So were you took the La Paris, ship, La Paris? KEBAJIAN: Oh, La Paris, I think was Beirut. OFLAZIAN: From where did you . . . KEBAJIAN: From Beirut, I think.

OFLAZIAN: Did you come to America alone? KEBAJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Did you come to America alone? KEBAJIAN: No. That was, well, before we come, came to America, we traveled through Beirut and (?).

KEBAJIAN: In, in those places we went, near the, where we had to stay until another ship comes. You had to wait, see? Not only one ship brought us to America. We had to stay in Amand. Amand in (?), Amand like in Beirut, where all these things. OFLAZIAN: So you stayed one month in Beirut to take the boat. You went to Marseilles, and you stayed one month in Marseilles, and then you come to America. KEBAJIAN: Whatever country was, is near the ocean, we had, the ship had to stay. Not only for us, but they're going to take things, you know, inside. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember the ship? How big was it? KEBAJIAN: Oh, I remember the ship, but I don't know.

KEBAJIAN: All together, yeah. OFLAZIAN: Did you see? KEBAJIAN: Sure. They show us, they were so happy, and so friendly. OFLAZIAN: What did they say? KEBAJIAN: Oh . . . OFLAZIAN: Do you remember what did they say? KEBAJIAN: They start to see, and I had, I had a beautiful voice that time, and five, I guess that was from childhood. My father knew that, and we were always trying me to sing and practice, see? And I loved that Armenian songs and Armenian acts. (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the drummer, Armenian drummer. Do you remember singing with the group when you saw the Statue of Liberty? When you saw the Statue of Liberty, did you sing with the group? The people, you said the people were singing in the boat, right, when the saw the Statue of Liberty. KEBAJIAN: They all saw, but at that time we did not know that belonged to America.

OFLAZIAN: How did you go to Ellis Island? How did you go to Ellis Island? KEBAJIAN: How did we go to Ellis Island? I guess, I guess the ship, (?) stopped there. OFLAZIAN: And how long did you . . . KEBAJIAN: The ocean there. OFLAZIAN: How long did you stay in Ellis Island? KEBAJIAN: I think if I am not mistaken about two weeks we had to stay in Ellis Island, before we came out. Because the government, I think they, they had the (?). OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for news. KEBAJIAN: The (Armenian). They had, well, people of the ship, they have to, they have notify the government that the ship is already in America, or those people . . . ( they laugh ) I am telling, you understand better. OFLAZIAN: Thank you very much. Yeah. I appreciate that. And what was the reason, why did you stay in Ellis Island for two weeks? KEBAJIAN: And I guess they picked it up that they were (?), go in the place we are going has no man. The persons, the person where, to which we go, her husband is died, orphan, she's going to keep. OFLAZIAN: You said you stayed two weeks. KEBAJIAN: That's why Ellis Island kept us as much as they kept, see? OFLAZIAN: Where did you sleep in Ellis Island? KEBAJIAN: Oh, they have the, something, what should I say? I don't know how it was. Other words, they had, you know, like pieces of, pieces of heavy, heavy, very heavy sheet made, you know. And they made a bed out of it, adn they used to have them on the walls which they used to, you sleep there, one under the other, see, like that. One way up in the top, another one like, three, three rows, like. You sleep beneath that. Maybe if they have a person, they make it four. As much as they can make it. People used to sleep there.

But that part I don't know. OFLAZIAN: Did you go through medical examinations? KEBAJIAN: Almost, almost on the, on the ships, usually, almost every country used to get examined. If you are in Beirut, Beirut has to examine. OFLAZIAN: So they did not examine you in Ellis Island? They did not examine you in Ellis Island? KEBAJIAN: I think they did, but I don't remember. Of course they do. Ellis Island is almost America. OFLAZIAN: So you didn't tell me what was the main reason that you . . . KEBAJIAN: I'm sorry . . . ( break in tape ) OFLAZIAN: This is Grace Oflazian. We are resuming now. Mrs. Kebajian, you did not tell me what was the main reason that you stayed two weeks in Ellis Island. What was the purpose? KEBAJIAN: I guess we were young, you know. Everybody, everybody was, the case is different. Different, different cases we hear. I don't know what was the, what was the reason to stay. I, I now can that's the way I think now. It was because she was like, my uncle's wife was lame, see. And she used to walk a limp. And she was like an orphan woman, understand? That's why Ellis Island kept us longer, see. OFLAZIAN: So who came to meet you in Ellis Island? Who came to meet you in Ellis Island? KEBAJIAN: If I remember, nobody did. But some, like (Armenian).
