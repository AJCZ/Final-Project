DALLETT: . . . and I'm beginning side one. Can we start off at the beginning. Tell me where and when you were born. SHERRID: I was born in Shargarod, that's in the Ukraine, in Russia, on, the exact date I don't know. The assumed date that I have developed in the United States is June 21, 1918. DALLETT: And what was the name of the town, I'm sorry? SHERRID: Shargarod. S-H-A-R-G-A-R-O-D. DALLETT: Can you tell me a little bit about your family life? SHERRID: And in Russia? DALLETT: Uh-huh. SHERRID: My, my mother was the youngest one of, uh, four children. She had three older brothers. My mother had the misfortune in being born after her father died. She was named after ( A fire engine is heard in the background on the tape. ) She was named after her father. Because she was the youngest one in the family, she lived with my grandmother. My grandmother never remarried. So that when my father married my mother he came to live in, um, my grandmother's house. My grandmother owned a, uh, grain mill and my mother had been very difficult to get, find a husband, because compared to the small town she was comparatively sophisticated because of the many travelers that came to visit my grandmother. So when she heard about this unassuming, astonishing, young man in a distant village, a, she, they met and fell in love and then my father came to live in my grandmother's house. It was my mother and my grandmother that ran the mill. My father was comparatively a student and a, they owned some property and land there and he would sort of supervise the, uh, the land. DALLETT: Tell me, when did you come along then, and your brothers and sisters? SHERRID: I have an older sister who is four years older. I was born in 1918, which was just at the end of the war. The reason my parents left hurriedly was because that they had been a number of pogroms in their town and they were told that that night their house was going to be burned. So my parents rolled up whatever they could get, put together, and they left the house. An interesting sidelight is the fact that my grandmother had this mill. She sold the mill to someone for a string of Oriental pearls. And this was, has an interesting history, I might as well tell you about this because it's been one of the family, uh, odds and ends. The string of pearls was going to go to my older sister because she was the oldest child in the family. And all the years, though the family was impoverished, they never were going to sell the string of pearls. And many years later after my grandmother died and we were in America already, uh, my sister was an adult, she had inherited the pearls. She thought she would restring them. They were not very attractive because they were short, small, dark, little pearls. And when she took it to Marcus & Brothers, a part of Gimbels that was the estate dealers, they examined the pearls and told her that they were worth two dollars. Apparently someone had made a switch and they were papier mache. So the farm, the farm and the house and the mill were all sold for these Oriental pearls and my parents hastened away with some of the other villagers to try to go across the Dniester River. DALLETT: Your grandmother was traveling with them, too? SHERRID: Yes. Shall I tell you what happened there, because it had a profound effect upon me? ( she laughs ) DALLETT: Yes, please. SHERRID: When they got with the villagers to the Dniester River, the procedure was that you would pay some, uh, villagers money to take you across in a rowboat. DALLETT: Can you just spell the name of the river? SHERRID: D-N-I-E-S-T-E-R. My mother's, my father's brother went too. A younger person. And what happened is whenever these villagers heard that there was some people coming, you know, who were trying to locate the people, they would just turn the boat over, and my uncle drowned. He was one of those people that drowned. My father and my older sister went across. Ah, it was my mother and my older sister went across. And my grandmother, my father and I were left on this side. It seems that they were hiding in the bushes and I started to cry. And, uh, it's the kind of story you hear about. But I heard about this when I was young and it left a profound impression upon me, that the villagers told my father to smother me, because they didn't want the other people to find them. And my father didn't want to do that. So at great hazard to himself, he crawled to a well and got me some water and, um, sort of pacified me and I remained alive. ( she laughs ) So that's why I'm here. And the reason this left a profound effect upon me is that when I was, uh, older I used to have nightmares in which I couldn't open my mouth. And I was always wanting to scream and couldn't open my mouth. I couldn't imagine what it was. And one day when I was engaged to my husband and somehow or other this story came up, he told me later he thought that that was probably an after effect. And apparently it must have been, because after that I didn't have that dream. So this was after they crossed the river and my father and mother were separated for several months because it seemed it was very hazardous to bring the three of us over. And each day my mother would go to the, on the other side of the river and she would ask the villagers, "When are they coming? When are they coming?" And they kept asking for more and more money. And so, whatever money they, my mother had, she was giving to them. My grandmother had the pearls on this side, otherwise that probably would have gone, too. So after a few months, when my mother had given up everything that she had and they realized she didn't have any more money, we were brought across. And, uh, we joined the family together. At that point they had very little money and they were very eager to come to America. In America they had, uh, my father had an older brother here who was established, and my mother had two brothers who were living here. So they knew that if they would come to America there would be some sort of family support. The problem was to get a passport or a visa to come. And, uh, they had to earn a livelihood while they were waiting for, uh, a visa to come and my father tried all sorts of different work, but he was really not very skilled. He had never really worked at anything. He had always been a student and then had just walked around supervising the land. So that he couldn't do any real physical work or, uh, he didn't have any skills that he could earn money with. So he went into business trying to sell, uh, different things, vegetables, whatever they could get. And they moved from town to town, wherever there was work that he could get. And finally the, uh, I forget whether it was the visa or the passport, came. But he finally had all the papers that were necessary. DALLETT: Was he just going to come or were you all going to try to come as a group? SHERRID: No, we were all going to come. We were all going to come. We were all going to come. My father had a terrible thing happen to him which was one of the few times that he cried. They had all the necessary papers and they were very eager to come and all set to go when he, at that time he was selling shoes. So he decided to go and sell the remaining shoes that he had left. He went to a neighboring village with the train, and sold the shoes and had the money for it and was coming back to where my mother was with my grandmother and the two children. On the way back he met some villager that he knew who asked him, "What are you doing?" And he told him, and he must have indicated that he had money in his pocket from selling the shoes. The point is that the ( voice off mike ). So the thing is that the, my father was very tired after the long, arduous day, so he fell asleep. And when he woke up his pocket had been cut out, with the money taken. He came home to my mother and she was sort of ecstatic, feeling that they were on their way. He didn't say anything to her. But during the night she saw that he was crying and his whole body was tossing and he had to tell her that the money was gone. And then they had to wait, the whole procedure to get all the papers again. And meanwhile they had no money at all. So they were really, he couldn't get a permanent job because everyone knew he was getting ready to leave. Also, there were many other refugees who were in his same position. So, it was very, very difficult times. So finally they got the necessary papers and they were ready to go. And this was in October of 1922. The boat was coming out of La Havre. They must have had the cheapest accommodations, whatever it was. The big problem was that my mother was in her ninth month of pregnancy. It was a long trip, uh, I forget, twenty-one or twenty- four days. And she was very fearful that she would have the baby on the boat. The problem was that if she had the boat on the boat, uh, she would not be able to enter because then she would need a passport for an additional child. So she was very, very concerned. Everyone was concerned. Naturally it was not a luxury boat. She was, uh, tossed around, great hardship, great mental anguish. But she didn't have the baby. The baby came three weeks later. ( she laughs ) DALLETT: Do you remember the name of that boat? SHERRID: Yes, I told you I have a, a pillowcase that has the picture of the boat. DALLETT: Tell me about that. SHERRID: I want to show it to you. I'd like to show you this pillow case that I kept. ( she unwraps it ) It says, "Souvenir of my voyage." It says, "R.M.S. Saxonia" and it was one smokestack, one smokestack. Ah, it's interesting. When my parents died, when my mother died, seven or eight years ago, we had, uh, no problem at all about money, dividing money amongst the three sisters or anything like that. We only had a problem with regard to pictures and souvenirs. DALLETT: Right, such as this. SHERRID: So, uh, the thing is this, that among the souvenirs, I got this one. DALLETT: And how was it that you came to have this? You said there was some kind of contest? SHERRID: No, I think it was, uh, either they gave it to everyone there or there was a drawing or there was some sort of a lucky number or something like that. But, uh, she, they got this pillowcase. And my mother and parents used it for a while. ( husband interjects something ) No, they probably couldn't afford to buy anything but there was some sort of lucky chance that they got it because they wouldn't have spent the money, really, to buy it. They used it for a while and then they just put it away. So, I was happy to get it. DALLETT: So the name of the boat then as written, there is . . . SHERRID: R.M.S. Saxonia. S-A-X-O-N-I-A. DALLETT: Do you, do you actually remember making that trip? SHERRID: I remember, there are two incidents that I remember of my early life. One is, uh, one small incident on the boat and the next one is the night I spent at Ellis Island. On the boat, the one thing I remember is sort of a, is a porthole that must have been very low down and water was coming in. And there were berths for more than just my family. There were many berths and water was coming in. There was a big problem of what to do b the people were concerned that the boat could get flooded on that end. so that was one memory I have on that. Apparently it was a matter that was scary, so I remember that. The second, um, remembrance I have is on Ellis Island. I'll tell you about that. I remember that I was, slept with my mother in a large dorm. It was a room that had tall windows that were rounded on the top, many of them. And in the bed, it seems it was a dormitory for women with small children. I remember when I woke up there was a good deal of sunshine and light and I was impressed by that because I felt it was a new beginning, all the sunshine and light. And then, of course, being a young child, things you remember, is that opposite of us there was another woman with a child. And that child had a name, Nancy. I remember to this day, I never saw her since then, which I thought the name, Nancy, was very unusual. And Nancy had a doll. I had never had a doll. And when I saw that doll I just looked at it and I looked at it all the time, I was thinking, how wonderful it was to have a doll. So that, I remembered the room, and then when I saw the room on Ellis Island a few years ago I really, I had that tumultuous feeling of earlier when I saw that room. Um, so the reason we slept in Ellis Island was that my grandmother who came over was blind and ailing. The authorities didn't want to let her come in. So my mother refused to have her go back. They wanted to turn her back. She refused to have them turn her back and she refused to just come in by herself. So the reason was, that is the reason we slept overnight. My grandmother was not in that room, neither was my father and older sister. So I believe this was just a dormitory for women. Ah, my uncle came the next day, and apparently they were able to persuade that they would take financial care of my grandmother should anything come up, that she would not be a burden to anybody, etcetera, etcetera. So she was permitted to come into the country. My next small memory is visiting an uncle. The uncle had a son who was three years older than I was. And as we approached the house, this cousin was taking me upstairs. They lived in what is now Harlem. And this cousin offered candy to me. The candy was something I had never seen before, which I thought was magnificent. It's, it was a strip of candy with the colored polka dots on it. And I said, "Oh, how luxurious to have, not only candy, but to have them in different colors. ( she laughs ) Whenever I see them, I don't know what it's called, but whenever I see that now, occasionally you see it sometimes in these, um, so-called antique restoration of villages where they have this old-fashioned candy, I always think about that incident. DALLETT: What language were you speaking at this time? SHERRID: We spoke Yiddish. Ah, ah, my grandmother spoke Yiddish to us and my mother,uh, that was the language that was used. My father and mother and grandmother, among themselves, spoke Russian. DALLETT: So, when you came through Ellis Island, uh, was as far as you remember, was there someone there to help interpret how to negotiate the examinations and the passport inspection? SHERRID: The, uh, the, I think there must have been people from Ellis Island there, and the next day my uncle came, so they were a help, would be able to help a great deal. DALLETT: Anything else you can tell me about your Ellis Island experience? SHERRID: I just remember that, but, um, somehow or other it's associated with my visit three years ago. Because something a little unusual happened there. I went, we were three couples that went. And incidentally the Park, um, National Park Department, their guides are just wonderful. She gave a full detained report, exactly what happened, you could sort of envisage what the place was like at that time. One of, I was very anxious at that point to go up to the upstairs where the dorm was and I wanted to see that room. I asked her where the woman's dorm was and she said it was upstairs. So we decided to go up. Now, a few years before I had, I had been working in a school system when I was injured, and I had problems with my back. So as a result, I have to walk with a cane. And when we came to Ellis Island there is, going upstairs, there's a railing in between, and they were walking up and they were walking a little bit too rapidly for me. So I had to walk on the other side of the railing. And as we were walking up the guide was telling us that when people came in for examinations, as they came in and were going upstairs, they would put marks on them with a chalk. I don't know exactly what, "C" if they thought it was cardiac, uh, some sort of mark if there was a problem with breathing, or problem if there was limping. I said to myself, "If I came now." ( she laughs ) I had to be on, coming up, and I couldn't cope with managing as rapidly as the other people, they might have left me, left me back, and I had a real funny sensation about that. On this trip three years ago, when I asked about the dorm, we went into various rooms on that second floor and they all seemed to be very small. I didn't picture, imagine all, what my initial picture of it was. So gradually as we passed the individual rooms, which were small, we suddenly came to the room that I immediately recognized. And when I asked what that, but it was not set up as a dormitory, when I asked what that room was they told me it was a medical room. And the windows and the whole bright, airy feeling was just what I had remembered. So I said how long had it been a medical room, and they didn't know. Well, I was so much interested that the very next day I called up. The person there was very kind and checked the records and told me that it became a medical room in 1924. So that in 1922 it very possibly was the room that I had remembered as the dormitory. So, it gave me a very warm feeling about that. DALLETT: Do you remember at all when you were on the boat and came into the harbor? Before you came onto Ellis Island? SHERRID: No. DALLETT: Nothing about that, period? SHERRID: No, I don't remember that. Of course, you know, my parents talked about it a great deal afterwards. But I don't personally remember. They were ecstatic. They were just ecstatic. DALLETT: So, so you were really too young at that point to be part of . . . SHERRID: Yes, I don't remember the Statue of Liberty, no, but I know that my parents were very happy. DALLETT: Ah, continue on, tell me what happened when you were released from Ellis Island. Your uncle came to get you? SHERRID: When our uncles came to get us and, uh, my mother had two brothers here. One uncle took us into his household. He and his wife had no children. They were very kind, they weren't making much money. They were working in a clothing factory, sewing, things of that sort. Ah, my mother was going to have a baby immediately, so we always say that my youngest sister was born in my aunt's bed, because actually they couldn't afford to go to a hospital. My mother had no prenatal care or anything like that. When I think about it now it makes me feel very, she was a very, very remarkable, stoic woman. So, then after the baby came it was necessary to find a place to live. So my uncles got together and they bought the furnishings of a three-room apartment on 100th Street and Third Avenue, which was a very poor neighborhood. Ah, I often think about it because of the fact that there was my mother, there were my mother and father, and my blind grandmother, and three children, and we were in a three-room apartment, and the toilet was in the hallway, shared by six families. It was on the fourth floor, back. When I think about that I say to myself, "How wonderful that my husband and I are ( she laughs ) living here." And I'm a most ardent ascriber to the fact that only in America can one see these wonderful things happen, through work, but it can happen. So that's how my parents started. And my father didn't know how to do anything. Um, so he couldn't cut or sew or anything, which the other uncle was doing, but the, the uncle, the brother on his side had a hand laundry. And he took my father in there to iron shirts. And when I think about it now, my father worked very hard, I think for five cents a shirt to iron. And it was done, not with electric irons, but with these irons that you dip into the water. As a matter of fact, in one of these antique shops I bought an iron of the type that my father used to use. And, of course, there was no air conditioning and in the summertime he would just sweat and I would just watch him and say, my father used to like to write poetry and he was a student and he never, ah. ( addresses her husband ) We have two, honey, this one. ( her husband talks about how the iron operates ) DALLETT: And how was that heated then. SHERRID: This was, he did on, no, not hot water, on a burner, a gas burner. So that, uh, he would, uh, iron the shirts. So, um, he wasn't getting anyplace. I don't know, would you like to hear further, because my mother . . . DALLETT: Yes, go ahead. SHERRID: My mother did a remarkable thing. So, my mother was enterprising and she was business-oriented because my grandmother had been business-oriented. So one day she was watching, looking at the pictures. ( voice off mike ) This kind of iron is the kind of iron that you put the whole thing on. Um, the disadvantage of this type of iron is that the handle would get hot, too. But on the other one that I had, where it's just a base, the handle would be put into the base, the handle, which would be cool, would be put into the base, and it was easier to, to iron that way, I mean, you can, it was, handle it better. But, of course, his hands were always full of blisters and things of that sort. One day my mother was looking, was walking downtown and she saw some woman who was very beautifully garbed and they, she was wearing a little pocketbook, um, satin pocketbook like an evening pocketbook with a mirror on the bottom with a drawstring. When she saw that she said, "Gee, that's beautiful." Then she said, "I think I could make that." But the point is that she, uh, could speak no English and when she spoke to some neighbors on the floor they said, "Well, how are you going to do this? You need to have ribbon, you have to have the string, you have to have the little mirror." So my mother said, "Well, I don't know. How do you go about doing this?" So she, they said to her, "Well, you have to have money." And she didn't have money. So she did something that I think was very enterprising. She, she made up a little pocketbook on her own. She bought the material, made up a little pocketbook on her own. She bought the material, made up a little pocketbook and went to, uh, downtown, near Orchard Street where they make these things, and went into a place and showed it to them and they said, "All, well, it looks interesting." And, of course, her price was very, very little compared to what was being done. And they said to her, "All right, they would like to have twelve dozen pocketbooks." So she was delighted, but she came home and she said, "How do I go about getting the wherewithal to provide twelve dozen pocketbooks?" So she went around to all the cousins and the relatives and they said to her, "Well, look, you take this order and you bring it to a ribbon place and show them the order, that you have this order. And then you go to a place with mirrors and see that, and go someplace for the string." So she did that and even though she spoke Yiddish and very, very halting English, she was able to get the credit. And she started making these pocketbooks in this three-room apartment. Anyway, she got all the neighbors in the building making the pocketbooks, you know, a home factory. And, uh . . . DALLETT: She already had experience running the mill, right? SHERRID: And in two years we were able to move to the Bronx. And have our own bathroom. ( she laughs ) Which was a major accomplishment. And so I have one of those little pocketbooks. That was another souvenir that I inherited. And then she went into decorating it with, she used the different kind of feathers and she, imitation ostrich feathers that hang down, and angora, and little bead work on it, and, ah, she was very creative and indomitable, she really was. DALLETT: She sounds it, yeah. SHERRID: She was fantastic. So, uh . . . DALLETT: In the meantime were you put into school, public school? SHERRID: Oh, when, my sister was put into public school, she was eight years old. And she ran into all the problems that children have, not knowing the language. My sister became a guidance counselor and has, like, um, three Master's degrees. But to this day she always remembers the fact that on her first day in school she couldn't let them know that she had to urinate and she urinated in her clothing and it was the most catastrophic thing that she remembers to this day. I was not put into school until two years later. And, I have to tell you, that when I said I didn't know my birthday, my mother was eager to have me go to school because my parents always believed that education was the source of everything. And she wanted to get me into school as soon as possible. So when I was, um, I don't know how old I was, but in September, uh, I guess it was almost two years later, she took me to a school and they wanted to have me admitted. And they asked when my birthday was. So she didn't know what to say because she really didn't know when my birthday was. But somehow a neighbor had said that if she told them when my birthday really was, which was a time that there had snow on the ground, there was, probably be January, that they would not admit me into school in September. So she told them my birthday was in June and they set the date, June 21st. ( she laughs ) So that's how I happen to have June 21st as my birthday. As a matter of fact, my husband and I have often thought about the fact that it would be interesting for me to find out the exact date, and that could be done by, since I know the Jewish date, it would be possible to look it up on a Jewish calendar someplace. But, but when it came to my mind I said I was too deeply involved in June 21st, which is the first day of summer, which I like very much, and I really didn't want to know the exact date because then I might have problems about what my birthday is. DALLETT: Right. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO DALLETT: This is the beginning of side two of interview number 40. Tell me a bit, if you can, about what the neighborhood was like that your parents moved into. Let's start back before they went to the Bronx, when they were at 100th Street and Third Avenue, were there similarities between that and what they had experienced in Russia? Was there a Russian community? SHERRID: No, no. In the Russian community they had great prestige. Ah, my grandmother was, uh, one of the, uh, outstanding leading citizens of the community. My father was noted for being, um, a scholar, very upright, very noble, very moral. Everyone came to him for advice and to my mother and my grandmother. So that, and they were not poor. They had, uh, my mother used to tell me about the clothing that she wore and everything was made to order and she was the most beautifully dressed young woman in the town. And my father spoke about the fact that he walked around with a cane with a silver handle and he was very handsome and had a beautiful moustache. So when they were left, when they came for the two years in Europe they were really downbeaten a great deal. Ah, the story is that when my mother became pregnant with my younger sister she wanted very much to have an abortion because she knew there might be a hindrance to coming. And she was all set. And the story is that the family tells, is that my father was very much opposed to it. And one day he was looking out of the window and there was a funeral. And the husband, there was a young woman who had died, and the husband was tearing his shirt and everything like that and it turned out to be a young woman that had had an abortion had died. So my father fell down to his knees in front of my mother and he pleaded with her that she must absolutely have the child. The child, he didn't want anything to happen to her and he said, "We'll manage." So that she had all that trauma about having the baby shortly after they came here. So that was a problem, too. So when they came here, first of all the apartment was very dingy, dirty, and I remember, this I do remember, a lot of bed bugs. And there were a lot of cockroaches and stuff like that, you know. This is one of the earliest pictures. My mother, my father, and these are my older sister, I, and the baby. and this was the uncle who, uh, gave my father got the job of ironing. So, so when they came here they were completely downbeaten and living the way they lived that way, plus the fact that my grandmother became sick and she developed a hip infection. She also had the problem with her eyes. They tried an operation on her eyes which was not successful, and so she really remained blind all the time. So they were very, very difficult times. And those bed bugs, I remember the big bugs. It was terrible. And, of course, sharing a bathroom with all the other families on the floor, there were problems. DALLETT: How about when, when things started to pick up and you moved to the Bronx? Was there more of a community there that your parents began to fit in with? SHERRID: Well, oh, there was always a community. That was the beautiful part about it. My family, the brothers, my sister, my mother's brothers and my father's brothers all, terrific support. Ah, this uncle that I showed you the picture of, he was sort of the rich one in the family because he lived in Manhattan in a, in a decent apartment. So every Sunday the whole family came and we took baths in his house. And then we all went on a picnic to Central Park. So my mother would be busy making, ah, preparing food, and every Sunday afternoon was devoted to family get togethers and gatherings. My parents immediately found, you know, these little circles that were developed, these burial circles. And they became active in their, the Shagaroders Society. And one of the things, they became very, very active in, and remained close in contact with all the people from their community. And my parents, I told you my mother was an activist, after some time she felt that she wanted to share with other Jews who were not, uh, didn't have money, and so, later on in the years she contacted everyone from that small town of Shargarod, from all over the world that she knew, and raised money and they set up a clinic in Israel in the name of the Shagaroders Society. All her life my parents were devoted to that small community and when my daughter got married this summer I sent an invitation and two of the people from that shargaroder, original Shagaroders, came to the wedding. And I was very happy that they did because I wanted those close ties. But I think this was intrinsic with all people who came from Europe, anyway, among the Jewish people, that they tried to help each other as much as possible. And, uh, they may not have had money, but they had support and love. DALLETT: Right, right. Um, tell me some more about what happened when you got to the age when you went to school. Tell me your first childhood memories in this country. SHERRID: Well, I remember my first day in school. I didn't want to go. ( she laughs ) Considering the fact that the rest of my life, my later adult life was devoted to education, the fact that the first day my mother brought me to school, and apparently I was so insecure that I just ran after her and I refused to come. And she had to really like punish me and insist that I stay in school. And I do remember that apparently I learned how to read at an early age. And when we moved to the Bronx and I must have been six or seven, seven years old, I remember, I went to the, on Courtland Avenue there was a library and during these summer I took out two books every day and sat on the stoop and read the books. And I read all the fairy tales, to this day I remember the lilac fairy tale and the purple fairy tales and the crimson and the lavender, and I always said, "Just look how may colors there are in purple. Lavender ( she laughs ) and purple and all these things." And I remember, that was our big, my big treat was walking to the library and getting out the library books. DALLETT: I, the one thing I like to ask people but I don't think it's appropriate with you is what their expectations were in their native country and what the reality of life was, but, to switch that around a little bit for you, you must not have had expectations, you were too young for that. But in looking back can you tell me, well, it's so obvious your life would have been so different had you not come, but, can you tell me a bit about that? SHERRID: Well, this was very much brought to my attention when I visited there in 1976, because when I looked around the town, and I saw it and I said, ah, "I might have ended up here," though actually many of the young people left. But I might have ended up there for some reason or other when I saw that I couldn't get over how different my life has become because I came to the United States. DALLETT: What, what would it have been like had you stayed there do you think? SHERRID: Well, let me tell you about the trip, because I think you might find it interesting what happened. I had a sabbatical. My husband wasn't free and I always wanted to see where Shargarod was because it had always remained, uh, something that we had talked about. Also, the fact that that happened when I was very, very young, I said, maybe if I actually see it, uh, the town, that whole business that happened when I was an infant would sort of be driven out of my mind once and for all. And I was very interesting in seeing my roots. So I decided to go to Russia. And when I did, I went to one of the travel agencies, the Russian travel agency, and I told them I distinctly want to go to this small town. And they said, well, they didn't know whether I could go but that they would write a letter to Washington saying I want to go there because it was not on the normal route. So I said, "Remember, I want to go, 'scuse me." They said, "All right." Well, as it happens the passport or the visa or whatever you want, came and it did not indicate that I could go to visit Shargarod. So I went again to the travel agency and I said, "Look." And they said, "No problem. You'll go to Moscow, which is the first trip, and you'll go to there and you'll go to the, tell them what you want to do and they will arrange it for you." So, so there was nothing I could do and, uh, when I got to Moscow, we were there about three or four days, I was very busy trying to see someone about this. No one in the Russian government would give me any help at all because they said, "It's a small town, it's closed. You cannot go there." Ah, I went to the American embassy. It was a Saturday and the person in charge wasn't there and they said, "Well, don't worry. When you get to the next place," which was Kiev, "You're sure to be able to make arrangements. Ah, Shargarod is between Kiev and Odessa, over towards the west. And they said to me, "You'll be able to make the arrangements in Kiev." So we got, came to Kiev. Kiev. But all the way along we have an American tour guide and I keep telling her, "I need your help. Help me on this thing." And in one way, she was sort of laughing at me because why should I want to go there? So, we got to Kiev and I, the type of thing that happened is that we got there on a Friday morning. Ah, I went to the desk and said I want to go to Shargarod, and they said, "Well, we can't help you now but the person in charge will help you tomorrow." So I said, "All right." They'd be down at eight o'clock. So I came down at eight o'clock in the morning and they said, "Oh. Uh, we can't help you. It's Saturday. There's no one here that can arrange it." So I said, "Well, why don't you take, somebody take care of it on Friday?" And they said, "Well." They just shrugged their shoulders. So I was quite miffed because I could just see that nothing was going to happen. So I tried to see somebody at the American embassy. They were closed. So I came back with the group. And I was very despondent over the whole thing. I could just see that the whole purpose of the visit was not going to be anything. I came back again and this time I started to scream. And I said, "I can't understand why you're doing this to me! My whole purpose was coming and, uh, and why didn't, why are you playing games with me? My whole purpose was coming and, uh, and why didn't, why are you playing games with me? That you told me, uh, to come today when you could have taken care of it yesterday?" And they just said nothing. So when I went in to the luncheon, I was sitting with my group and I couldn't eat and some man came in. And one of the people on the tour said, "You know, that's the American Consul." And I said, "Really?" And they said, "Why don't you talk to him about this?" So I said, "Oh. What can I do about this." So I finally got up enough courage and they said, "Well, you're not going to get any place unless you try." I said, "I've been trying," but, I said, "All right." I went over and I spoke to hi and I'd like to give him due credit. His name is, uh, Honorable Robert Porter. And he was there to set up a, he was part of the advance team to set up a consulate in Kiev. He invited me to sit down and talk with him and I sat down. I told him the whole thing and he said he was very sorry that he could not make any arrangements to get into a closed town. He's tried, made many efforts. So he asked me if I had relatives there and I said no. And he said, "Then we'll . . ." He said, "That's the whole thing. When you tell the Russians that you have relatives there, they don't want, they don't permit you to go because they don't want you to entice them or build their hopes up. And if you say you don't have anybody there, then why do you want to go?" So I said, "I'm very eager to go. What can you do?" He said, "Well, I'll go over to the desk and see what we can arrange." So he went over and he put in a call that they should make every effort to help me. And that was Saturday afternoon. Eight o'clock Sunday morning, the reason I remember it in such detail is that I couldn't get over the, uh, the red tape and the way they were operating. When I came down eight o'clock in the morning they said to wait till nine. When I waited till nine they told me they're very sorry and when they opened, I said, "But look. The consul had put in a request." And they said, "There's no request." I said, "Well, look in the book. There's a request." They said, "There's no request." So when I insisted that they look in the book, sure enough, of course the request was there. So Sunday night nothing happened. Monday morning, again. Meanwhile, we were supposed to leave Monday at one o'clock. So, for Odessa. And at that point, I knew that I would be past the time of getting to Shargarod? So, Monday morning the same thing happened. No results. So, on Monday, the thing that was interesting, they said, "Well, uh, we sent your request there." How did you send it?" "By telephone." I said, "Uh, well, when will I get an answer?" "Well, we won't hear from them till Wednesday." I said, "Why should it take till Wednesday?" "Oh, it takes time for the letters to arrive." I said, "I don't understand. If you called up and put the request, why can't they give you the response by telephone, you know. Instead of waiting for a letter?" So, they looked at me as if I had discovered the telegraph, you know, as if it was so unusual to use a telephone. So, when I went out, they said they would see what they could do. After lunch, nothing happened. The suitcases were brought down in the station wagon to go. And, uh, my suitcases were the last ones put on the station wagon. And as I was walking out suddenly I got a call from the desk. "Mrs. Sherrid, we got the approval." So when I came over they said, "But it's going to cost you." Originally, they said it would be, at that time it was like one hundred and fifty dollars extra, and I said, "All right." So then, all of a sudden, now it comes past one hundred and fifty dollars, at that time they said it was going to be three hundred and fifty dollars. And I said, "Well, why should it be that much money?" And they said, "You don't have to go. Just say the word, you don't have to go." So I said, "You know I want to go," I said. "Look," they said, "your luggage there, either yes or no?" So I said, "Yes, I'll go." So, at that point the American guide, they did it very deviously. My luggage was the last two pieces. They had it all prepared. They just dropped the luggage in the road and the guard, they just made a signal like this, the two pieces were thrown off and, uh, the station wagon went off, and I was left this way. So I started to inquire, and I said, "Who's gonna take me?" The chauffeur in his private limousine. And I said, "Does he speak English?" And they said, "No." "Well, I can, I go with someone who doesn't speak English." Well, they said, "You'll need a guide, an interpreter." "Well," I said, "All right." "But it's gonna cost you." So I said, "Well, I have to have somebody." They said, "Another one hundred dollars." All right. Now this was going to be for one day. So I said, "All right." I went out and got the luggage in and I told them to keep the room for me, and as I was standing there, the consul came. And he said, "Oh, I'm so excited, you're the first person that was able to do anything." He says, "I'm not giving my credit, he says, "Maybe I told them, I had screamed." And he said, "Maybe, I don't think that really helped, but maybe everything all together." So he was very happy about it. Then he said to me, "Do you know," he said, "why don't you, uh, have dinner with me, here at the hotel, and I'll tell you what to see and what to do." So, I said, "Thank you very much." He said, "I know you're all alone here." Which I was. You know, generally people that go to Russia go with a group. And I've never really gone any place by myself, you know, uh, generally I'd go with my husband. Here I was going with a group. So he came over that evening and he brought a map for me, which I have there. And, uh, of Russia, and he showed me where the town was. And then, we were talking about what my procedure was going to be when I got there. And the procedure that he outlined was something like this. He said, "When you get there, ask to see the mayor of the town. Then you see him. Give some sort of reason as to why you are going. Tell them you are interested in education, uh, or some sort of aspect of that sort, that you want to do something for the town." Am I talking too long? DALLETT: No, no, no. Can we just stop for a minute? SHERRID: Um, so he said, "You see the Mayor." And the reason I'm mentioning this is because, what I saw was so opposite." And you speak to him and I'm sure he'll help you." He gave me the map. Incidentally, the map was like a cherished possession, because there are very few maps in Russia that they give you. So, the next day, I started off with this Lindmilla, who was my guide, who thought I was a really, crazy bourgeois because who would dream of a place where you don't know anybody, and spending all this money, just for fantasy. Uh, we drove a distance, and we came to the town. And the car couldn't come in because the roads were too narrow. So he had to leave the car outside, and Landmilla and I walked in, and we looked around and all we saw was these little thatched roof houses, uh, one or two brick houses, very narrow winding streets. We saw a woman carrying milk on their shoulders, with buckets, and we said something, Rue Ludmilla asked for a mayor, and there was no such thing as a mayor. So she says, "Well, look, let's turn around and go back." Of course I wasn't so ready to go back. So I saw a building that had a, uh, a flag on it. I said, "Maybe this is something." And we went in. Inside were two women sitting there with babushkas, it didn't look like an office, but apparently it must have been the town place. And Rue Ludmilla gave them the information about my, my family name, and there's no record of anything. So, she says, "Come on, let's go." Because she was anxious to get back. Because we would have to sleep on the road in a hotel. So I really didn't want to leave without, so, I, then I really got good idea. I said, "I want to speak to the oldest Jewish person in the town." So they said, "Oh, yes." The woman said, "There's a Mr. Weinstein." So she told the other woman to take us down to see this Mr. Weinstein." We went down to see this Mr. Weinstein, who was an aged man. I looked at the streets, and I couldn't believe that this was the town that I had come in. And, uh, when I saw this Mr. Weinstein, he was an aged man, and he looked, uh, but he was full, full faculties. So when I came in here, how do you go and tell somebody the city you came from. So I said, "I from the United States and my name is, uh, Golda (Russian) which is the way you identify yourself, but I was identifying myself through my mother's side, because that's how they knew her in the town. And guess what he said, he said, "Um, Massa, that was my mother (Russian), that's my father. "She, he, she was married to Getsa (Russian). He was very good to his mother-in-law." This is after fifty years, and I burst out crying. After fifty years, I couldn't believe it, that he would remember her, and I just said to myself, "My darling parents, that the memory, that after fifty years, that they are still remembered in the town." So, of course, I was very, very happy about that. So, then he said, "Would you like to see the house?" ( she laughs ) And then he told me that someone had lived there but he had died recently, and the house was locked up. I was so deeply moved that I, that I didn't think to ask who has the key to the house. But we, I ran around, we ran down the hill to the house, and, uh, I saw the house, and my oldest sister, one of her earliest memories is that as a child she had fallen on some broken stone on the back of the house. So, of course, I had to take a look, and the broken stone was there. I took pictures for her. And I ran all around the house, and then I had another interesting experience. When I came back to this Mr. Weinstein, he had gotten all the old people from the village there, and they were all very eager to see me. And all of a sudden, a little old woman comes up and she says to me, she says, uh, she identified herself, and I didn't know who she was, and it turned out that she was the sister of my mother's closest friend. My mother had a series of pictures on her wall of herself with a close friend. And this was the sister. And she said to me, "Uh, (Russian), meaning, "You must be Mulka?" Which is my older sister. So I said, "No (Russian), I am the second one." So then she said to me (Russian), "You must be "potato-pancake" because I used to enjoy potato-pancakes. And that's how she identified me. And, of course, I was just crying all over the place. And then, she took me to the nearby synagogue, where they were having service, and there were several people who remembered my parents, and they wrote messages for me in the little book. And, of course, it was a very impoverished synagogue, and they, uh, the things they were reading from were just scraps of paper. Loose sheets of paper. And, uh, they didn't even have a torah there but they carried on their services anyway. I wanted to see the cemetery, to see if I could see, but the cemetery where my family would have been buried was closed off because it had been finished and they had a new cemetery. And since it was getting dusk, I didn't have a chance to see that. But, just that alone, was a terrific experience for me. So I was very happy that I made the trip. DALLETT: Do you have any of the, um, besides your pillowcases here, any of the original papers? SHERRID: Yes, I have my passport. This is another thing I asked for, ( she laughs ) from my sister. DALLETT: This is, uh, let's see. Can you interpret? SHERRID: Shargarod, this is the town. That's the district, that's the town, that they came in, and here am I, Golda. DALLETT: Uh, at age four. Uh, the date here is June 4, 1922. And his is father, mother? Wonderful. Anything, that says, oh, this is, this is actually the passport then? SHERRID: Yes, this is the original passport. See number 46 Cunard Line. Apparently, it must have gone to Bucharest (?) first, and then they had to go from Bucharest to Le Havre. So that's why it took that time from June until October, till they were able to get there. DALLETT: That's wonderful. SHERRID: Uh, I made copies of this so that everyone in the family has a copy. DALLETT: Tell me, just in a nutshell, what have you done since you've been in a? SHERRID: Uh, I started school, I went to elementary school, I went to Hebrew school in the evening. My parents were very concerned about education. When, uh, I was in high school, ready to go to college, uh, financial circumstances became more difficult, and I couldn't go to college. I was determined to go. I went to college at night. I had a job from nine to five and I went four times a week, to college at night. And because of things that happened I was graduated at one hundred and sixty-eight credits, eight-and-a-half years at night. Uh, without any education courses, b they said I would never be a teacher. But after my marriage and my son was born, I decided to go back to school and became a teacher. And then, I have a master's degree, I have a, uh, all the credits except the dissertation towards an E.D.D., a, I have tenure as an assistant principal in the junior high school, tenure in the elementary school, and I'm also on the principal's list. Then I got hurt separating two children in a fight in the lunchroom in high school. And I couldn't work after that, and it's been, uh, quite miserable about that, in that respect. I'm very delighted, that I'm married to a man who is, uh, also came from impoverished parents, and now he is a Commissioner of Parole for the State of New York, going up the hard way. I have two children. My son is a cardiologist. My daughter, who was just married, is, uh, this summer is, uh, went to Princeton, and my son went to Cornell and Columbia Medical School, and she was Phi Beta Kappa, Magna Cum Laude. And I think that my children, that's my greatest joy, that my husband and I were able to give them the education that, uh, we had trouble getting. DALLETT: Thank you. SHERRID: Only in America. ( they laugh ) DALLETT: This is the end of Side Two of interview 040.
