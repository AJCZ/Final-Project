LEVINE: Why do you think it's important to carry on the Greek family traditions? SPANOS: Because they're Greek. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Yeah. Could you say what it means to you to be Greek? What does it mean to you to be Greek? SPANOS: I don't know. LEVINE: It's kind of a funny question, yeah. How about America? How do you feel? Do you feel as though you are an American?

SPANOS: They look really better, you know, yeah. LEVINE: But you like to go back, so I guess you like both worlds. SPANOS: ( she laughs ) I can't now, because my brother died, and I don't feel, you know, I'm no, my feet hurt me, and I don't. But thirteen times was enough. Every two years, every two years. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And your husband would go back, too, with you? SPANOS: My husband come 1962, I go with my husband. And after 1965 he died. But . . .

You look like you have more energy than I do. SPANOS: I feel good, and the doctor don't find me nothing. But I say, "Doc, my feet." "Arthritis. I can't do nothing for you," he say. And one day he say to me, "Tell me, Maria, what you do when you was too healthy?" I say, "Maybe six months on the beach." That's all I. LEVINE: On the beach? SPANOS: Six months we live on the beach. We have house on the beach. Six months there, and six here. LEVINE: Huh. So you think that you go in swimming? SPANOS: No. We don't go to the water, but I have nice piazza in the back, in the front, and I stay here, yeah. And the fresh air, you know, the fresh air. LEVINE: Okay. Well, is there anything else that you can think of that has to do with changes that you've seen in your lifetime, things that, I mean, like, when you started out in Greece, probably there were no automobiles. SPANOS: No, no. LEVINE: In your town. SPANOS: No automobiles at that time, no. LEVINE: Do you remember when you first came here, some of the things that you saw that you had never seen before?

SPANOS: Yeah, watch my . . . LEVINE: Your children, uh-huh. SPANOS: Yeah. He going over to make some business, but they don't like it. And he came back. In 1949 he send me, "Go to see your mother and father." LEVINE: Ah, I see. Now I see why you went so often. SPANOS: Yeah. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Well, why do you think they chose to go and stay there and you chose to stay here? SPANOS: Because my mother have arthritis, and she thought maybe there it's going to get . . . LEVINE: It was better there. SPANOS: Yeah. It was better there, because they go in, uh, a (?), what, hot water, you know. BOTOP: Health spas. SPANOS: They make, yeah, yeah. They go, you know, every year, and I go twice. Yeah. LEVINE: Did it help your arthritis? SPANOS: Because the water, the hot water come from the mountains, you know, hot water. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what happened that water, and they make you good, yeah. Yeah. LEVINE: Okay. Well, is there anything else you can think of that maybe we haven't, we haven't covered? Anything else you can think of to say about, uh . . . SPANOS: What else? LEVINE: Yeah. Are there any other family legends, Irene, that you can think of that maybe we haven't covered? BOTOP: I can't think of any. I will say her good luck is due to my father's businesses. LEVINE: His businesses in the . . . Well, wait, he worked in the shoe shop. BOTOP: Oh, and then he left. LEVINE: And then, your husband left the shoe shop. SPANOS: Yeah. LEVINE: And what did he do then? SPANOS: Oh, he go to, for the Greece, for the cheese. And after he come back he go again.
