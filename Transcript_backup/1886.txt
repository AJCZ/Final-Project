OFLAZIAN: How old you were that time? ZOTIAN: Oh, about three or four years, I don’t know. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember playing with your brother? ZOTIAN: No. He was a baby, and I, we used to... OFLAZIAN: Do you remember your town, Aziziyi? ZOTIAN: Aziziyi. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember? ZOTIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: Can you talk about it for me? ZOTIAN: We had a home there. Aziziyi. And my uncle, my father’s brother was older. And he had to build a big house there. It was a big place, and we had our house next to them. It was beautiful. There was garden, big garden, and there was river running, small river. We had a very nice time. My uncle and his wife and children. So we used to lock the door. Nobody could get in. Outside was a big, big street, and big river. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember what kind of trees you had in the garden? ZOTIAN: Pardon? OFLAZIAN: Do you remember what kind of trees you had in the garden? ZOTIAN: Oh. Apple trees and different fruits, and... OFLAZIAN: Like what? ZOTIAN: I don’t exactly remember. I was too small to walk around the garden, but I remember apple trees near. Big, a lot of trees. OFLAZIAN: Have you ever climbed any tree? ZOTIAN: No. Not me. I was too small. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember going to church? ZOTIAN: Maybe we did, but I don’t, I don’t remember too well. We used to go, my mother was a priest daughter. Everything was fine. OFLAZIAN: Did you go to school? ZOTIAN: Over there? No. No. I was too small to go to school, and, later the things happened, you know. OFLAZIAN: Happened like what? ZOTIAN: (she sighs) They killed our parents and took everything away. OFLAZIAN: Who killed your parents? ZOTIAN: (she coughs) Turks. Turks all of a sudden came and took, took us out of our house, and put the ladies and children in the church, and took the men to prison. So we’re there, and I, I used to be scared. Over there the Turks used to come and walk around all the time. And I used to hide under my mother’s skirt. I was scared. They took some of the children and threw them in the rivers. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember which river was that? ZOTIAN: I can’t remember. Big, big river. They were taking us, later on they were taking us to a village, separately, you know. Few people here and there. They used to take us to the village, and I could see the big river and the children in it. I know from that that they throw the children in the river. OFLAZIAN: Where was your brother that time? ZOTIAN: My brother was with us. Baby, baby, small. (she clears her throat) OFLAZIAN: And your father? ZOTIAN: They took him to prison and we didn’t see him anymore. (she clears her throat) OFLAZIAN: So since then you did not see him? ZOTIAN: No. OFLAZIAN: And then where did you go? ZOTIAN: I can’t remember the name of the, of the village. They took, they took us and put in a, in a village where the Turks are, you know, all the Turks are there. We stayed there I don’t know how long. Not much, not much. (she pauses) And then here and there they changed our place, and I don’t know exactly. Later on, I don’t know how long, somehow we came to, to our town, as I remember, if I’m not wrong. So here and there my, my brother died. I don’t know what it was. We stayed here and there for a long time, I don’t remember. It was terrible. Hungry and Turks were very bad, mean. My uncle’s wife was with us, but I don’t know where she went later, and her daughters. (she pauses) I can’t remember much. And later on, we were in a house with my, my aunt and others. Later on somehow they, my mother died. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember what was her reason of her death? ZOTIAN: I don’t know. We were walking and looking for things and places, and there was no water, no, no bread, nothing. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember where you were walking? ZOTIAN: It was changed a lot of times, to come to the villages and all that. I used to hide all the time under my mother’s skirt. OFLAZIAN: After your mother died, where did you go? ZOTIAN: I was with my aunt, there with my aunt. OFLAZIAN: Where did she take you? ZOTIAN: I don’t know. I don’t remember many things, but later on my uncle from Egypt and his son had come to, to this little country, I don’t which country it was in Turkey. So, his daughter came and took me, and he took me to Egypt to his parents. OFLAZIAN: How old you were that time? ZOTIAN: I was young. Really young. I don’t remember. OFLAZIAN: Around? ZOTIAN: Around four, five, four years, but I don’t know. So he took me to his parents. OFLAZIAN: How, how did you travel to Egypt? Do you remember that? ZOTIAN: In the, in the boat. Travelling boat. There were some young children, daughters, and I think their mother or what, they had somebody that. Anyway I was next to them, they took care of me. And my cousin, I think he came with me, I don’t exactly remember. He took me to his parents. I stayed there a few years, I grew up, and from there I had my old aunt, my father’s wife and his daughters. Somehow, I don’t know, they had come to America. So from there my aunt had another daughter in Cairo, Egypt. So they took me from my aunt’s house to her house in Cairo. This was Alexandria. In Cairo I went. They sent me to Cairo with my cousin, I was with my cousin. And from here, my, my aunt knew, knew families and boys, neighbor, nice boy. They sent him to Egypt to get me. Somehow he came over and I didn’t know what to say. I couldn’t say anything. I was going, he was going to take me to (she pauses), he, we got married. And he took me to America. OFLAZIAN: When you were in Alexandria, in Egypt, Alexandria, Egypt, did you go to school over there? ZOTIAN: Very little. Very little. We saw Armenian school there. I went there. I learned a little Armenian. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember the name of the school? ZOTIAN: No. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember going to church in Alexandria? ZOTIAN: I can’t remember. So from there my husband came. We married and came to America. OFLAZIAN: So you married in Alexandria. ZOTIAN: Hm-hmm. OFLAZIAN: And you came with your husband to America? ZOTIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: How did you come to America? ZOTIAN: In a boat. (she coughs) OFLAZIAN: From, do you remember the port, the harbor you left Alexandria? ZOTIAN: I can’t remember the thing. From there we came here, and they were trying to examine me. Who I was, where I was. I came from Egypt. And... OFLAZIAN: Who tried to examine you? ZOTIAN: (unintelligible) Ellis Island. (she clears her throat) OFLAZIAN: So you did come to Ellis Island? ZOTIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: Was it the same boat you came from Alexandria? You said you took, you came by boat, right? ZOTIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: Okay. Was it the same boat brought you to Ellis Island? ZOTIAN: I suppose it was, I don’t know. So they left me in, in Ellis Island. My husband (she clears her throat) went home, but he left me here because they wanted to examine me. They want to keep me here. I stayed one night. They gave me a nice room. And then the next day when I got out, walking wherever we have to walk, there was a man there examining. Questioning. He was questioning me in Egypt, Egyptian language. I knew a little English. I answered him in English. OFLAZIAN: Oh, that’s great. ZOTIAN: In, in English. The names and all that. And everything, whatever he did ask me. And when I was, it was finished I, I didn’t go to bed there anymore. One night, and my husband came and took me home. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember how old you were that time? ZOTIAN: About sixteen or something like that. OFLAZIAN: So, when you slept in Ellis Island, did you eat anything? ZOTIAN: I don’t remember anything. I was awake, but they knocked at my door and wake me up. And I dressed and go out, and then we walked to that place where the man questioned. And then over there someplace my husband came and took me home. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember going through medical examination in Ellis Island? ZOTIAN: No. No. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember if Ellis Island was crowded that time? ZOTIAN: I didn’t see too many people. Not too many people. OFLAZIAN: Can you describe me that room that you slept in it, in, that night? ZOTIAN: It was a small room, but it was nice. There was a bed. Comfortable. (she clears her throat) Put me, put me in there that, for one night. OFLAZIAN: Was it clean? ZOTIAN: Yes. Yes, it was all right. It was like near the office or what. OFLAZIAN: Did you take shower? ZOTIAN: No. Nothing like that. OFLAZIAN: So the following morning your husband came to take you. ZOTIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: So, how did you go? Where did you go? ZOTIAN: Where... OFLAZIAN: Where did you go? ZOTIAN: When? OFLAZIAN: When your husband came to Ellis Island to take you. ZOTIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: So, where did you go together? ZOTIAN: Oh, he took me to his home with his parents. With his parents. And he had two other brothers. They were married. They had wives, too. They were all in one family. OFLAZIAN: So, when you left Ellis Island with your husband to go to his parent’s room, right? ZOTIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: How did you travel to his parents room? ZOTIAN: My husband took me. I don’t remember. He took a taxi or what. That’s what it was. OFLAZIAN: You remember. Do you remember anything seeing in New York that you never seen before? ZOTIAN: We used to live in Long Island. I didn’t come to New York too often. OFLAZIAN: No. I meant when you left Ellis Island with your husband to go to his parent’s room. I mean to his parent’s house, right? So, what did you see in New York that you never seen before? (there is a pause) ZOTIAN: Everything was all right. Everything looked nice, streets and all that. It wasn’t like Egypt. Good town. OFLAZIAN: How was Egypt? ZOTIAN: All right, but too many Egyptians. (she laughs) OFLAZIAN: Do you remember them? ZOTIAN: I remember the way they are.

OFLAZIAN: How were the Egyptians were? ZOTIAN: Not too bad. Not too bad. They were all right. OFLAZIAN: What was your expectations from America? ZOTIAN: I didn’t expect anything.

ZOTIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: For how long? ZOTIAN: For a long time. We didn’t change. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember the house you lived with these parents? ZOTIAN: It was an apartment.
