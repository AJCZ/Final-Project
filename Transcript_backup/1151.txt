She knew how to speak English, French, Russian, Polish. ( disturbance to the microphone ) When she (?) English, we could not write when I see a word, too. Very educated. And Hitler finished her off. ( voice off mike ) LEVINE: What did she teach you? MITTELMAN: The First World War was German there, it was not Hitler. And she got a job right away for the German government to work in the office. Even the Pollacks, after no more Germans, they gave her a job. And they very seldom hire a Jew. They don't like Jewish people. LEVINE: Were you close to her? MITTELMAN: Yeah. LEVINE: What kinds of things do you remember? MITTELMAN: She was my teacher when I was small, teacher when I liked to read and write, everything. She was a good sister, very close.

Was that considered a big difference in your life? MITTELMAN: Then they start the war, the First World War, and the Germans came to Vilna, occupied Vilna. They chased the Russians out. LEVINE: What do you remember about the First World War? What did you actually experience yourself? MITTELMAN: That time was no Hitler. LEVINE: Right. MITTELMAN: And as soon the Germans came to Vilna, all the food disappeared, and they, they made us get a pound bread a day for a person. Half was good flour, the other half they mix it with, they call it clien [ph]. They feed the horses. It was no good. It was very rough to digest. And we had to live that way. LEVINE: And what else did you have to eat during that time besides bread? MITTELMAN: We had a, they used to smoke a lean potatoes. We had a couple potatoes. LEVINE: Did you see any violence? MITTELMAN: That time the Germans treat everybody the same. It was no Hitler, the First World War. LEVINE: So they treated the Gentiles and the Jewish people the same. MITTELMAN: The same thing. One time I was digging a ditch and a Pollack was doing the same thing next to me, and they was making fun of me. I remember the Germans slapped him in the face. They said, "Leave him alone. Everybody's the same to me," he said. LEVINE: What else did the occupation of Vilna, what other differences did it make in your life when the German soldiers were there? MITTELMAN: They were there about four years, which was no Hitler. My uncle and my aunt, they leave him for now. That the outskirts for Vilna and they had a mill to grind flour, all kind of flour, and he made a lot of money. The German Army used to bring a bag of flour to a guy, and he used to steal twenty pounds from every bag, and he, and they sell the profit with the Germans, with themselves, the German (?). They rob the German government, and they got rich from that. Every bag of flour, they took from the off, and the profit they got they share with the Germans. They became very rich. LEVINE: Did you have grandparents living near you? MITTELMAN: I remember my grandparents. LEVINE: What do you remember about them? MITTELMAN: My grandparents had, it was a rabbi, he had smelt rabonis [ph]. But he never once make money on that. They had a dairy farm.

Just tell, describe it, what he gave you. MITTELMAN: They call it, like split [ph]. Bob, I see it in the market. He used to trick me with that. LEVINE: Was it . . . MITTELMAN: A piece of cake sometime, yeah. My grandfather could have take a job as a rabbi in a temple. He didn't want to be a rabbi in a temple. He wants to make a living from there. LEVINE: Well, what was your grandmother like? MITTELMAN: Her name? LEVINE: Yeah. MITTELMAN: Sit in the house and read the holy books. Her name was Mary. LEVINE: And did you, did she ever take you any place, or did you, do you remember . . . MITTELMAN: During the First World War, we didn't have enough bread. The Germans took away what little bread. My grandmother used to came with a full bag, slices of bread, and bring it to the house, we should have enough to eat. She was good to us. LEVINE: Do you remember any religious celebrations or observances? MITTELMAN: In Vilna? LEVINE: Yeah. MITTELMAN: I know we had the best cantor at that time, Motri Hirschman [ph]. That was his name. He was able to sing even opera. He had a powerful tenor voice. And that was our pleasure. Every month he used to play in the temple. I used to go there and listen to him. That time we didn't have enough heat. I used to forget about food, and I went there to listen to him. LEVINE: It sounds as though you were very religious as a young man. MITTELMAN: Me? LEVINE: Yes. MITTELMAN: I was, I cheat a little bit. I wasn't for nothing. My father and mother was very religious. My father especially. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Uh, what, what else did you do for enjoyment? What activities did people do for enjoyment? MITTELMAN: My age? I grow up, I used to like to read day and night. I used to go to the library, look for books and see them read. That was my pleasure, nothing else. Read. LORRAINE: He said there were beautiful gardens. He would always tell me he remembers gorgeous gardens there. LEVINE: Do you remember the gardens in Vilna? MITTELMAN: Oh, yeah. LEVINE: Tell me about those. MITTELMAN: Was two nice big gardens. One was to go in free, and the second one they had to pay something to get in. They had a nice cafeteria there, and a band, music. But I used to get in free. Near my friend used to take, dig out a hole on the bottom. We used to go in there. LEVINE: Under the gate? Under the fence? MITTELMAN: Under the fence. I used to go in and watch everything. They had music playing, and they had a stage. They used to have all kind of shows there. LEVINE: What kind of shows? MITTELMAN: They had Jewish theaters. I used to see them for nothing. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: How about music? Did, did anybody in the family play music? MITTELMAN: I like music, but nobody in my family played music. LEVINE: Well, Vilna was a cultural city then. MITTELMAN: Huh? LEVINE: Vilna was a cultured city. MITTELMAN: Yeah. A lot of educated people come from Vilna. LEVINE: When you think back of your time living in Vilna, are there any experiences that come to your mind in particular? MITTELMAN: I lived there all my life, and sometimes a Polish teenager try to stones, but I fight back. I never let them get the best of me. I know that. Then my uncles send affidavits to come to United States. They stayed first two months in Denmark. LEVINE: How did you feel about coming to the United States? MITTELMAN: It's a nice, free country. The first thing they asked me, before they, in Ellis Island, what type of government you believe. I told him, "Democracy. Democracy, where you could live nice and have enough to eat." I said to them, "Communism, that means starvation. We never had enough food under the communists." And they were satisfied. LEVINE: When you came to the United States, who came with you? MITTELMAN: I was the only one. LEVINE: You came by yourself? MITTELMAN: Yes. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And your uncles here sent you, uh, a ticket? MITTELMAN: I had to wait on Ellis Island two-and-a-half days till they bailed me out from there. LEVINE: Well, tell me about leaving home. What did you bring with you? What did you pack up to take to the United States? MITTELMAN: In Europe, I didn't do nothing. I was a young boy. LEVINE: You just came without any baggage or luggage. MITTELMAN: I stayed almost in Russia, almost, about six weeks till I got the visa. Every time I used to go pick up the visa from (?), it was about two hundred people in the line, and they only give out one hundred. And one day I said, "There's no choice." I got up, four o'clock in the middle of the night. I went down to the United States ambassador there. LEVINE: The embassy? MITTELMAN: And I got there, I find certain people I had (?), and I got my visas. Soon I got the visas, the agent in charge find out I got the visas, he took charge of us. For Warsaw, we traveled, we stopped in Denmark, and they put us on a big (?), and they feed us everything the best, all the eat I could eat, the best. We stayed there almost, we had our vacation there almost about two months. LEVINE: Why were you staying there? MITTELMAN: I don't know. They give us a good time. And then . . . LEVINE: Did they examine you for medical, uh, exams? MITTELMAN: Yeah. They used to take us and get a shower, and we see there eat the best, all kind of food. Then after a month or two months in Denmark, they put us on a boat, a regular boat, to travel to the United States. LEVINE: And what was the name of that boat? MITTELMAN: Oscar II, I think. LEVINE: And where did it leave from? MITTELMAN: Well, we traveled, the first three days was nice and pleasant to ride on the boat. On the fourth day I got up and I went on the deck. I saw the boat was the size of a finger. A big wave. I got scared. I thought I'll never make United States. That was three days. After, on the fourth day, they quiet on the ocean. It was nice and smooth. He came to the United States. LEVINE: Were you traveling in the steerage? MITTELMAN: Huh? LEVINE: Were you in steerage, on the bottom of the ship, with everybody in one place? MITTELMAN: I was on the bottom, yeah. LEVINE: And what, and where did the ship leave from? MITTELMAN: Huh? LEVINE: Where did the ship leave Europe from? What was the port? MITTELMAN: The port was Denmark, from Denmark. When they got to United States, my uncle bailed me out, me and my father, and he went in New York on Delancy Street, I remember. And they serve us (?) soup, and a nice piece of steak. I remember that. LEVINE: ( she laughs ) Do you remember when the ship, when the Oscar II came into the New York Harbor? Do you remember that? MITTELMAN: That was, uh, in 1924. LEVINE: And do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? MITTELMAN: I passed by the Statue of Liberty. LEVINE: Did you know what it was at that time? MITTELMAN: I heard about it. I remember another thing. When we came already in Ellis Island, I saw a boat with bananas, and the colored people worked there. And I heard everybody holler, "Nigger, nigger." I said to myself, "Why they insulting them?" I felt sorry for them. They call them all kind of names. LEVINE: Were they selling the bananas? MITTELMAN: I don't know. They deliver them to the market, I think. LEVINE: Had you ever seen a banana before? MITTELMAN: No. LEVINE: Um, so tell me . . . MITTELMAN: In Europe we never saw bananas. We never saw tomatoes. We had a lot of nice fruit in Europe, but not like in America. LEVINE: What was your impression of Ellis Island when you, when you went there? What did it look like, and what happened to you there? MITTELMAN: I slept two-and-a-half days on the floor in Ellis Island on newspapers. Then my uncle, on the third day he came and bailed me out, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. One week they didn't let me do no work. They took me to all kind of shows, movies, and they bought me new clothes, a nice suit. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO LEVINE: Were you staying on Delancy Street when you first came?

MITTELMAN: My uncle came. LEVINE: With a car? MITTELMAN: Uh, by train, I think. And then we went to Pennsylvania. I stayed there for one week and rest, and then I got a job in a restaurant, a dishwasher. LEVINE: Do you remember the name of the restaurant? MITTELMAN: I worked there a couple of weeks. I was allowed to eat all the food I could, and thye paid me ten dollars a week. After I work in that restaurant, I left that restaurant, and I worked for a while. My uncle had (?) a restaurant in Philadelphia. He was partners with another one, and I work there. And, uh, I didn't like the work. The, my uncle's partner always thought I'm spying on him that he don't steal money during the night when he work. I cleaned that restaurant, and I work like, they have a nice, big restaurant, and I work there for a while as a dishwasher. Then they put me on the night shift, and I became a short order cook.

Clinton Place that time was a nice neighborhood. LEVINE: Was that in Newark? MITTELMAN: Yeah. A lot of lawyers had the home, doctors. Then later on it started to change. Colored people, and the neighborhood wasn't so nice no more. LEVINE: What do you feel proudest of that you did in your life? What makes you feel satisfied that you did?

Do you feel like you have some ways or habits or keep some kinds of customs that you learned in Lithuania, even though you came here and you lived the rest of your life in America, do you have some Lithuanian, uh, qualities? MITTELMAN: I have no feelings. I'm glad I'm here. I wouldn't like to live there on the other side the way the Gentiles treat the Jews. Every time you walk down the street they call you bahaha [ph] Jew. That means you're (Yiddish). LEVINE: Did you run into any prejudice for being a greenhorn when you first came here? MITTELMAN: Here in this country? No, not much. LEVINE: How, how would you describe yourself, when you look back, when you were twenty years old, and you left, and you left, uh, Lithuania, and you came here, how would you describe yourself?

They went for me to make it good. I'll never forget. I went in. They gave me a paper to read. I read it, and then they asked me, "Are you selecting congressmen?" I told them I couldn't be the territory. One state has more, and the other state has less. And the senators, they have two senators to each state, and they gave me citizenship with no problem. LEVINE: How did you feel when you became a citizen? MITTELMAN: I felt good. I felt like a member of the American people. Yeah. LEVINE: Okay. Well, maybe that's a good place to end. MITTELMAN: Yeah.
