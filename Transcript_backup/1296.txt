PEDICINI: Yeah, I was lucky. I was lucky. "VOICE OFF MIKE": Well how long, in other words, you applied to come to America? PEDICINI: Oh yes. Oh yes. "VOICE OFF MIKE": How long did it take from the time you applied? PEDICINI: Oh it wasn't long. You see this, my uncle was in america. He made an application for me. He sent me money too because I was in First World War and when I come back home I got no money. I got nothing. I got some money from my uncle and he sent me application to come over here. I was broke after First World War. I go in the army I was eighteen years old. When I come from the army and make an application for this country I have no condition to do anything. Before the war we was in pretty good condition because in my house we got a bakery and a shoe make shop. CLOUTIER: You worked in a bakery? PEDICINI: My mother, my grandmother got a bakery to make bread and to sell just in the town and somebody out of town to come and to pick them up. "VOICE OFF MIKE": And your father had a shoe shop.

PEDICINI: Oh from seventeen, I go in seventeen. I come back from the army I twenty. I was only twenty. "VOICE OFF MIKE": So three years. PEDICINI: Yeah. I was in Turino (unintelligible), Turino when I was discharged from the Army. And that was the condition of my house got pretty bad. I want to stay in Turino because I begin to work and I have-- CLOUTIER: In where? PEDICINI: Turino, one of the biggest cities in Italy. And then is my uncle begins to say, "Why don't you come to America? Why don't you come?" So I got it just in time to come over here. CLOUTIER: What did you hear about America before you came? PEDICINI: Oh, it was a nice country, a lot of opportunity to make a better living. That's what I hear from that time. That time was very bad. I was pretty good, I managed pretty good because I got a little education in Italy. In this country, I no go to school in this country. But a little English what I do is (unintelligible) way, especially now it's worse yet because from the time I quit work I talk Italian in my house and I forgetting a little English that I just know before. But I manage pretty good over here because I was a healthy man, healthy boy. I like to work. And I managed pretty good. CLOUTIER: And you had your trade. PEDICINI: I got my trade, sure. After '23 I come over here. Then in (?) I go back to Italy to get married. "VOICE OFF MIKE": You went back to Italy to get married? PEDICINI: Because I had a girl over there and we was engaged and I (unintelligible) to go back and I went. And that, you know, after a couple of years conditions are pretty bad yet. And the people want to borrow money and can't pay you back. And then I decide to come back again to this country. As soon I come back in this country I got my citizenship papers. I call to my wife. And I raise my family over here. That time before I go back to get married I was in Long Island, Rockville Center, Long Island. That's where I make a little money. "VOICE OFF MIKE": Rockville Center? PEDICINI: Rockville Center, right. You know Rockville Center? "VOICE OFF MIKE": Oh sure. PEDICINI: At that time it was called a village. Now it's a big, quite a big city. "VOICE OFF MIKE": Sure. PEDICINI: Pass time too, near the beach. CLOUTIER: So, when you got married over there you brought your wife right over? PEDICINI: Then in Rockville Center I make a little money. I go back over there to get married. After I get married the little money that I make, I spend it when I got married, lend some to brothers and sister. And I was broke again. And I land up in America. I come over here. Before, I was on Long Island I did pretty good. But when I come back after I got married I don't want to go back to Long Island because I was young at that time. I like the woman too, I like to run too by that time. "VOICE OFF MIKE": No. PEDICINI: You know, I like my life. When I come back I was married. I realized that I go back on Long Island I begin the same thing I had been before. I said that time it is no good, and I stay in New Jersey. CLOUTIER: And you're still here. PEDICINI: Yeah, still here. I was in Summit, begin in Summit in 1928. "VOICE OFF MIKE": Always as a shoe-- PEDICINI: Sure, 'cause I make shoes when I come here to stay. After Summit I stay quite a few years. 1939 I buy first house. My children get to college, I send them all to college. And I work hard. My children, everybody got good promotion for college. The girl got teach position. The boy got engineer position from Newark engineer college. And then I say when I got to decide, I got to go to Italy again, I got to see my people. In 1960 I go to Italy again. And since 1960 once in a while I go back and forth I go quite a few time. CLOUTIER: Has it changed quite a bit? PEDICINI: Oh yeah, oh yeah. Italy is different country. "VOICE OFF MIKE": I used to live there. (ITALIAN), between the Mafia and the-- PEDICINI: Oh yeah, (unintelligible) all this location, it's beautiful, beautiful.

PEDICINI: Mary Grace. She passed away quite a few years ago. CLOUTIER: Right. When she came, when you came over with her, did you-- PEDICINI: No, no, I come first because I got no citizen papers. "VOICE OFF MIKE": No, but when you came back over. CLOUTIER: Back with her as husband and wife. PEDICINI: No, she came alone. CLOUTIER: Oh, she came alone? PEDICINI: Oh yeah, she come some friends of mine. Some friend of mine got married in Italy and she come back at that time with his wife and himself and my wife. She come alone here. I come first. I got my citizen paper. CLOUTIER: Right. PEDICINI: And I send the money to Italy so she can come around here. CLOUTIER: Did she come through Ellis Island also? PEDICINI: No, no.

PEDICINI: I don't think nobody could make it, nobody talk about that. "VOICE OFF MIKE": I was just curious. PEDICINI: I can read about, see in that time can read about some time once in a while somebody get off the ship, they try to swim through. CLOUTIER: Did you know anyone that was sent back to their homeland? PEDICINI: No, personally, no. But I know some Italians, the first Italian people, but personally, no. See, I see some face yes, quite a few, especially for the eye. CLOUTIER: For their eyes? PEDICINI: Yeah, especially for the eye. CLOUTIER: Trachoma? PEDICINI: Yeah, trachoma, we call it (ITALIAN).

On the side. No in the cuffs, no. People make a sacrifice and put the money up and everything else to come over here and when reach over here can't go through, you got to go back. It was pretty bad. CLOUTIER: So when you got into America, what did you first do? You went to New Jersey. PEDICINI: Yeah, Jersey, Newark. CLOUTIER: And then you got a job? PEDICINI: Yeah, find a job. I was shoemaker.

"VOICE OFF MIKE": Oh, you made the trumpet. PEDICINI: The trumpet, that's right. After you make it stick with the shellac and dry out, then you sand paper, you got to clean them up and (unintelligible). I work over there a couple of months. But I can't stand it, too much dust. "VOICE OFF MIKE": Too much dust and smell. PEDICINI: Then I begin to find a shoemaking job in that, work for a shoemaker all the time. See, I was pretty good shoemaker because I wanted be proud. I was a pretty good shoemaker in my time. I make new shoes. But over here soon a lot of stores, lot of (unintelligible), do you remember, do you know the name of Johns Murphy, Bannister, it was all good shoes that time. It was slow, couldn't find no job over there. That's what I like to do. And I begin with the repair. And that, what I have to begin with the repair, I would, you know, manage pretty good.
