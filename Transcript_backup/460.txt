SIGRIST: Was that difficult for your parents? EVANS: Oh yeah, you know. People didn't have money over there, you know it. But nothing. She was sick for three years with TB and there we was all in a small house. House like that. That's when Wales, that's where he, we start from to this country,, just think of it. SIGRIST: What did that house look like on the inside? EVANS: Well, small, yeah. SIGRIST: How many rooms did it have? EVANS: Only just a, didn't have much, two bedrooms, you know, and they were close together, you know it. And a big long room, and we have to sleep together, you know it.

My mother had awful time. SIGRIST; What kinds of medicine did they have for TB at that time? EVANS: Well they didn't get too much, you know it. SIGRIST: Did they have any kind of home remedies? EVANS: Well, not much, I don't think, there was nothing you can do to that TB once, now they can cure it, you know it. Oh they was sick, you know it. They cough and cough.

SIGRIST: Because it reminded you? EVANS: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: So the living was very poor? EVANS: Yeah. SIGRIST: How did you heat your house? EVANS: Well, they heated it with coal, you know it. Or if we go out and pick a few sticks around. SIGRIST: Where did they get the coal? EVANS: Well, man would sell it, you know, by the hundredweight, yeah.

And you had to be back home 10 o'clock. SIGRIST: If you went out somewhere with your husband, husband-to- be, where would you go, if you went out on a date? EVANS: Well, we'd go t a village or something. There wasn't much time, you know it. Late when we get out of the house, perhaps it'd be 6 or 7 o'clock, you know it. Oh, they didn't care.

And one day, they said to their father, "Why don't you," --we talk Welsh, you know it. "Why don't you talk English," they said, "so we can know what you're talking?" So we talk English all in the house. But you never can forget it. SIGRIST: Tell me about the first time you went back to Wales. What was that like for you? EVANS: Well, it was, you know everything was about the same. I stayed with my sister, you know it. She died, it'll be two years now, yeah. SIGRIST: How old were you when you went back the first time? EVANS: Gee, I don't know what I would be. I was working though. I was working in the restaurant. Yeah, because I had to go out of work, you see. And, so I don't know how old I, oh, 50. SIGRIST: You were 50 when you went back for the first time? EVANS: Yeah, yeah, 50 years old. I can remember now. Yeah. SIGRIST: Had Wales changed from how you remembered it? EVANS: Well, I didn't think it was changed much. I went to the stores, and things like that. You know, I couldn't see too much change, yeah. SIGRIST: What about the house that your sister lived in? Was it more modern than the house you grew up in? EVANS: Oh yeah, they had bathroom, and everything now. In my time, they didn't have nothing, you know it. Yeah. SIGRIST: How long did you stay the first time? EVANS: What did I stay? Wait just a minute. I went with another woman, she was in Masonic Home. And she went back, I went with her, you see, in the Masonic Home. so I stayed, it must be, I don't know, I stayed two months. SIGRIST: Oh, a long time. EVANS: Oh yeah. SIGRIST: Were you anxious to get back to America after that? EVANS: Well, yeah. And I came home all alone. And I was in New York for five hours and didn't know anybody. Oh, I was scared to death! SIGRIST: Did you go over by boat the first time? EVANS: Yeah, I went twice with a boat. yeah. And then after that, when there was plane, I went plane. SIGRIST: Did you get seasick on those visits like you had gotten seasick when you came to America? EVANS: No, I didn't get, I got sick the first time, you know it. SIGRIST: But the other times were pleasant? EVANS: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: Let me ask you, are you glad that you, or that your husband decided to come to this country? EVANS: Well, I would never come myself. I got to get used to it. SIGRIST: How do you think your life would have been different if you had stayed in Wales? EVANS: Well, a lot different, you know it. We seem to get more things in America, you know it, than is in the old country, you know it. SIGRIST: It's an easier life. EVANS: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: Well, Mrs. Evans, I want to thank you very much for letting me come out here and ask you a few questions about coming from Wales. I appreciate the time. Thank you.
