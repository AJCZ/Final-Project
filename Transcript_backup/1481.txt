DANE: This is Debby Dane, and I'm speaking with Milton Sachs on Friday, November 8, 1985. We're beginning this interview at 2:50. We're about to interview Milton Sachs about his immigration experience from Lithuania in 1921 when he was seventeen years old. Mr. Sachs, would you please tell me when you were born and where you were born? SACHS: I was born in 1904 in a little town in Lithuania called Gelvan, G-E-L-V-A-N. And the town was a small town, roughly about, um, I would say maybe a hundred and forty families. About a hundred of them were Jewish people. The other forty were non-Jewish. They were either, there was a cloister there, which is a church, and marketplace in the middle, but they used to refer it to it as "Gelvan is as big as a yawn." You get in, and before you know it you're on the outside of town. DANE: And how would you describe it? Did people have animals or? SACHS: Well, the people, eh, judging, but not all of them. Some were tailors, they couldn't have any animals. But we, we particularly were very, I would say, very affluent, relatively. We were all very happy children. We had a little farm, a little store. Our main business was selling needles, thimbles and oranges, sometimes five oranges. If somebody came in to buy an orange, they would ask you who is sick in the family. That's how. We had a, we had a cow, sometimes two cows. We had a horse. We had chickens. We had geese. And, as a matter of fact, I used to crawl into the place and get the chickens that lay the eggs and I'd pick up the eggs. And we had a big garden. And the garden, we planted potatoes, we had, um, we had , uh, anything that you could think of. Onions, which I like to wish now, and, uh, and, um, anything else you can think of in terms of a garden. And then we would harvest it at, uh, during the wintertime, we would harvest it. We'd take it upstairs. The potatoes, we'd dig in the ground, so it doesn't freeze over the year. We also had apples. The apples we would take on the roof, cover some straw, so she wouldn't freeze. DANE: Huh. And how, big family or a small family, yours? SACHS: No, we had a family of nine children. My mother had nine children. She was a, what you call it, a midwife. She was very educated, and she used to be the reader in the synagogue for the women. See, the Jewish people used to have the women upstairs, never in the same place with the men. See, my mother used to be upstairs. She was the leader of the, all the, all the women. She knew more about it, because she was a very educated woman. DANE: And was as the Jewish faith important to your family? SACHS: Oh, yes. My father was a very religious man, and he was a, a, as a matter of fact, he was a leader, and every year they would finish a, what you call, a whole torah. When they'd finish it, as a religious as he was, he would jump on the, on the table, and they'd all dance from joy. DANE: Hmm. And when you were expected to follow, did they want you to go to school and study rabbinical . . . SACHS: Oh, yes. I started, I started from when I was three or four years old. I was so smart, that my father thought that I was so smart, I used to count a hundred pennies in no time. So they sent me to the ah, to the, a rabbi to teach me and, um, and the rabbi, every time I said something right, he used to drop over penny on my head, think that God sent me a penny. ( he laughs ) DANE: That's wonderful. Did you speak Yiddish at this time, and Lithuanian? SACHS: Yeah, I spoke Yiddish, except during the war. When the Germans came in, as you know the story, during the war I learned four years of German. So when I came to this country, I passed the German, like Heinrich Heine and all the, in German. But I couldn't pass the English. I didn't know how to translate neither, but I knew the German. SACHS: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Any relatives come to the United States when you were a child? SACHS: Uh, we had nine children, and we were, most of them started, one started in 19, in, well, about, actually, about 1900. Of course, an uncle of mine came from first. He, he continuously, he came to America in Chicago, and he kept asking to send the children. So we were six children came to America before I did. So we came here in, was in, in 1921. There were six children already here. If you recall, I showed you a picture, that were only three of us, and my mother and father came. And we were the last ones, the last of the Mohicans. DANE: Uh-huh. Do you, did you get correspondence from them when they first came over? SACHS: Yes, but not during the war. When the war came, the First World War, we could not hear from for years. My mother used to say, "Gosh, God, if I'd only see them and die I'd be happy about it." Finally, after the war, we had two soldiers in, um, in the Army here. And when they were, when they were, when they left the Army, anybody who was an American soldiers could, could get their children, could get their parents over without any problems. DANE: Uh-huh. We'll get to that in a second. Did they, when they wrote, were your parents telling you of any of the stories of what life was like here? Did you have any picture of what it must have been like? SACHS: No, I have no picture. But you can get an idea, an idea, you could have bulbs, lights, all we had was a kerosene lamp. We never, no, a candle. It was something my mother and my father used to cut, shave, a long piece of wood, and put it on a, on a stick, and the, and the wood would burn. That was our light. DANE: Huh. You were a young boy in 1914 when the war started. Do you remember World War One at all? SACHS: Oh, yes. I remember very much, because we used to, every time there was a war between, we used to chase after them, we used to chase after the soldiers and see how many got killed, and come back and it was a lot of fun. ( he laughs ) DANE: Did it frighten you? SACHS: No, no. You don't know, that's something. But anyway, we never had a car, we never had a car there, there were no cars then. And when the first car came, one time, he was a (Russian), he was a landowner, and in a car, and everybody locked the door because they figured they get, they get hurt. ( they laugh ) DANE: Get run over. SACHS: Run over. One car. DANE: That's funny. When the war came, and it was between the Germans and the Russians, is that right? SACHS: That's right. DANE: Do you remember seeing the German troops coming into your village? SACHS: Yes. Matter of fact, when the Germans came into our village they, they, they slept in our house. And they, they, we children had to sleep on the, on the roof, on the steps of a barn. And the Germans would sleep in the house, but they were courteous enough to let my mother and father have their bedroom without any interference. DANE: Was this just a few of them or a lot of them? SACHS: No, lots of them. One by one, one by one they went. Yes. DANE: Were you responsible for feeding them? SACHS: No, no. Except there was once one guy, used to run around and tell, tell us to be clean. He wanted the windows open. But we used to keep the windows, he wanted the windows open. He wanted the people to have the clothes, clothes, uh, nicer. We didn't have any money. And, um, one woman, I think, they even cut her hair. And my mother said God apparently punished her because she didn't go to synagogue often enough. DANE: And when they also, I remember reading in your memoirs, it's along the same lines as this cleanliness, that they would do checks for scalp scars and, is that right, and lice? SACHS: No, lice was something that a lot of us had, which we used to have, people used to get lice and clean them. My mother was very careful to make sure that we didn't have any, yes, there were some lice. That's right. DANE: When the Germans were there, were they better than the Russians were to you? SACHS: Ah, see, the Russians were, at that time, there was, no, eh, they, they, they believed that the, the Jews were giving information to the, to the, eh, to the Germans. They thought we were more friendly to the Germans. And, at one time, I don't know if you remember the story or not. At one time, uh, the Germans, the Russians said if we find any Germans, we will, uh, your life will not be, it will be at stake. And unfortunately, after they left, they saw two Germans crossing the river. They came back, and they buried him alive. They had the children, his children, were buried. That was my father's brother, I think, or cousin. I think it was a brother, or it was a cousin, I'm not sure. And they had him buried alive. The daughters, the children burned alive. You remind me of some sad stories. DANE: I know it's hard to recall them, but just for history's sake, were there other horrible instances where the Jewish people in Gelvan were the object of persecution. SACHS: Oh, yes. They used to, they used to go out and grab, and grab the children, put them in concentration camps. They took my older brother Ralph, who was on the, came with me, and they put him in concentration camp to cut wood. And, uh, and my mother, one time, see, I'm reminded of stories, my mother one time came to look for him, and she didn't recognize him, he was swollen from hunger. And, uh, she, he came over to the gate, and she says, "I'm looking for my son Ralph, Rafo." He says, "Mother, that's me." And . . . DANE: She didn't recognize him. And then she was able to get him out of that concentration camp? SACHS: Yes. It just so happened that one of the, one of my cousins, very brilliant, used to go to, he lived in Riga, which is another big city, and he used to play cards with the officers. And he managed, somehow, in about two weeks, he came back. DANE: Hmm. So it had a good ending. SACHS: He came back, and for a while, they used to roll my brother in sheets and so on so he'd get better. He got very strong. He was the strongest in the family. DANE: During the war, were you, had your family decided that as soon as it was possible, they would try to come to this country? SACHS: Oh, yes. There was no question about it. We just waited every day. DANE: And then how did that come about? How did the steps happen that you were allowed and able? SACHS: That's a big question. It's because my two brothers were soldiers in the United States. And then we had to go to, to Riga, to get, I believe my father went with my mother, went to Riga to get the ambassador, the American ambassador had a post. So we went over there and we got the visas. We waited six months in Kovno, it's another city, big city. We waited with the, with the family. My mother's, my father's sister. And, and they, they went to Riga, and they finally go the signatures and everything was cleared. We got our passports to go to. DANE: Do you remember the day you left Gelvan? SACHS: Well, it was in November, 1921. It was possibly, well, it was probably six months before '21, we were in Kovno for six months waiting for getting our passports. DANE: Was it sad when you left your town knowing that you may never come back, or were you relieved? SACHS: Oh, we were tickled to death. Who would have ever wanted to come back? We were sick of it. All the children were in America. She used to say, mother would say, if I only live one day, i'd be very happy. Of course, she lived to the year of eighty-six. DANE: So she saw a lot. And then you traveled from Gelvan, to Kovno, to Riga? SACHS: Riga, we took the passports. DANE: Uh-huh. SACHS: And then we had to steal, they give you, what you call, the which is the line between one country and another. And there was a Hebrew Aid Society. I think they're called HIAS. They used to meet you at the, at the place where, somebody would steal you over the place. You pay them something to get you over. And when you got over to the HIAS, which is the Hebrew Aid Society, they then came over and they took us over to, to Berlin, I think it was, and over there my mother went to see her cousin after in Berlin. DANE: And then from Berlin did the men from HIAS stay with you when you went to the port of exit? SACHS: I, he must have, because we went to, I don't remember exactly that, but we went on the boat for, I think it took two weeks on the boat, and then we came to, uh, to make sure that we were all clean, and also we didn't have any glaucoma, that we were in Goteborg, we went to Goteborg. DANE: Is that in Sweden? SACHS: That is Sweden. And in Goteborg we stayed about two weeks, we were fumigated, we were cleaned, and uh, we apparently got the, got the right to go to America. DANE: And did they check your eyes in Goteborg? SACHS: Oh, no question about that. My eyes were checked, everything. DANE: Was it exciting to be in this new city? SACHS: Oh, yes. It was so exciting because, uh, the doors were, they were, the locks, the hotels were never locked. And the stores were always open. My brother- in-law made a mistake. He decided to go to the store, he opened up the store, at noontime, when nobody's supposed to come in, and there was an alarm all over, trying to get, trying to get. By the way, we met a very nice Jewish couple that came to meet us, possibly also sent by the HIAS. They came to meet us. And they, um, matter of fact, she fell in love with my brother. But nothing happened. DANE: And, at these ports of exit, like this big city in Sweden, were there lots of other people getting ready to go to America? SACHS: Oh, yes. Most of them were Jewish, yes. Most of them were Jewish. That's right. DANE: Would you talk to them and find out what their story was? SACHS: Oh, yes. We talked about each other and such. We even found relatives over there. Yes, we did. DANE: Was everyone excited, anticipating, afraid, was it an, how would you describe this adventure? SACHS: Well, it was a, my mother and I were the sickest one on the boat. Furthermore, I don't know why, but we got well enough. But it was, oh, it was excitement. As a matter of fact, when, Sunday when we came to the, when we saw, when we came to close to the United States, I think one of the things very exciting to me was I saw a black man for the first time in my life, and he was eating a banana. DANE: Had you seen that before? SACHS: No. Never in my life. DANE: What did you think when you saw it? SACHS: I was, I was, well, I was very surprised. But before he finished the banana, we saw, coming up to, uh, to a big, to a big monument, which is the, which is the monument of the Ellis Island. DANE: The Statue of Liberty? SACHS: The Statue of Liberty. Everybody could get excited about the Statue of Liberty. And some Englishmen were on the boat and says, oh, whatever it is. And, uh, we then, that's the first time we saw the Statue of Liberty. We saw the Lazar, was it? DANE: Lazarus. SACHS: Lazarus. Says, wants to free the country, you know, the quotation there, she wrote. DANE: And did, did, had you heard about the Statue of Liberty before you came into New York, or was this a surprise? SACHS: I don't think so. I don't think we knew anything about that, except we saw it. We carried all kinds of, uh, uh, bags on us, which was, uh, dilapidated in a sense. We didn't have, big bundles, or something, but we came. I don't know exactly what we did, but we did get . . . DANE: How much, speaking of, so you didn't have suitcases. SACHS: Oh, no. ( he laughs ) No suitcases. DANE: When you left Gelvan, what did you take with you? SACHS: I don't think, ( he laughs ) I think there was maybe three or four bundles or something, I don't remember. DANE: Of clothes. SACHS: Clothes. There was nothing really much. DANE: And food, on the boat, did you, did you bring food? SACHS: As long as the food was, uh, kosher food. A lot of it was sent by HIAS, that's why. Kosher food. DANE: And, uh, you were sick most of the time, but what exactly did you eat on the boat, do you remember? SACHS: Oh, sick was because of the, not used to the waves, or so on. Maybe a day or two, nothing serious. DANE: What day did you leave? Do you remember? That's pretty specific. SACHS: Well, if you figure we came in July, and we came in in July, so we must have left about, um, so we came down in July, we must have left about June the 15th. DANE: When you met the man from HIAS, did he have the tickets for the boats in your passage, or did you have to get that in Sweden and . . . SACHS: Well, we most likely had the tickets. I don't think we, we had all our tickets with us. The man from HIAS, he was meeting a lot of people. No, he didn't have it, sweetie, it, we had everything. But he came up and he talked to me. He's not, his daughter, she sang to us. Um, a song about our plight and it was so terrific, excited, when you sang, the girl sang to us, and we all said, my gosh, this is really, after all we're not coming to a strange world, this is a world with Jews and so on, we are home. I think we had to stay over on Fourth of July. DANE: Okay. You arrived in New York. How old were you? SACHS: At that time I was seventeen. DANE: Seventeen. And you arrived on July 3rd? SACHS: On July 4th. They wouldn't let us go home until we, over the holidays, we had to stay an extra day. And they served some Uneeda crackers. DANE: The what? SACHS: Uneeda crack--, Uneeda Biscuits, you know Uneeda Biscuits? I almost vomited. Couldn't eat it. DANE: And did someone have to explain to you what the Fourth of July was? SACHS: They must have, they must have. I don't know. DANE: And were there celebrations on the Island that you remember? SACHS: No, I don't recall, per se, remember, but that was the reason. I don't remember the celebrations. But they give us tables, and they served us all kosher food. DANE: What, what would you eat on the Island, exactly. Can you remember? SACHS: Eat on the Island? DANE: Yeah. What kind of kosher? SACHS: Oh, it must have been, um, apparently, say, maybe soup, I don't know, if anything else, there was something. We were well fed, I don't remember exactly the food we ate. DANE: How were you treated there? SACHS: Oh, great. Great. It was nice, everything was, as a matter of fact, we went through the gates, the passport, say, it was, it was just a, heartwarming. DANE: When you stepped foot on the Island, did you and your mom and your brothers, did you feel like you'd come home, or did you feel like this was a strange, unusual place? SACHS: No. We felt we were coming home. DANE: And impressions of New York City? SACHS: That was, uh, I don't know. But, I think, Ellis Island is a little off New York someplace. I don't think I remember this. I wasn't exaggerated about it But, oh, some of the Englishmen that were there, they stood there amazed at the size of it, and they were talking about, they were also, but they were not, they spoke English, I think. Englishmen. DANE: Were there translators for you on the Island, that you could make yourself understood? SACHS: I think it was most likely people from the HIAS. DANE: Uh-huh. I remember meeting, reading in your memoirs, that on the Fourth of July one of the HIAS members brought his daughter. Can you tell us that story? SACHS: Yes. He brought his daughter, she sang a song, I can't remember, I can't remember the words, but he, first of all, she sang in Yiddish, which explains that here's a place where all our, all our, we're not more heart in the, in the golus, it means in the strange land. Now you're at home. Something very encouraging, but I don't remember the words, exactly. DANE: And did other people listen, or was it just . . . SACHS: Oh, listen, it was now a celebration. Look at that. We are back home. DANE: Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I also read that when you were still in Lithuania, that you referred to the United States, do you remember the term that you referred to it, as the Golden Country? SACHS: The Golden Country? Oh, the Golden Medina. That's right. DANE: What, what is it? SACHS: That's the golden, that's the golden, let me think, golden, jewelry is gold, gold, gold, and Medina is land. It's the Golden Land. That's right. DANE: Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Let me just . . . SACHS: That's right. This country. DANE: On the island, you said, well, on the trip over, you'd seen your first black man, you'd seen a banana for the first time, were there other things, food, that you hadn't seen before? SACHS: Oh, well, I know. One other thing I've seen, I came over, they came over, the family, there was a big celebration in my family. All of a sudden we saw lights, and they gave me a tomato, they served me. And I couldn't hold it, I had to go back into the, gave it up, I couldn't even eat the tomato. That's something I'll remember. Now I like tomatoes. DANE: And you like them now. I remember you mentioned peaches. SACHS: Peaches? No, see, we used to, over, we used to have orchards. We used to be takers, caretakers of orchards in Gelvan, for somebody else. We used to stay here overnight. And we had all kinds of apples and pears and cherries and we also had horses, by the way. And I used to sleep to watch our horses. And in order to be stolen, we used to put on something so when they go they can't, uh, move. So we used to sleep at night there with the horses, at night. Watch 'em. DANE: Back on Ellis Island, did you and your family, were you asked questions? Did you go through another medical exam? Can you remember what the people on the island . . . SACHS: No. There's no more. DANE: Questions at all about how much money you had, or where you were going, do you remember? SACHS: Well, they knew where we were going, because we told them we were going to Chicago, so they kept us there b we couldn't, couldn't make it. Those from New York went home. They kept us. No. They knew we were going to Chicago. DANE: Do you remember where you slept that night, what it looked like, if it was on the floor, on a bed, if there were a mattress, or sheets? SACHS: No, I don't remember. DANE: And do you remember what it looked like, if you were a television camera, were there lots of people there, or . . . SACHS: Oh, it was loaded. It was full, full of people, all kinds of 'em. DANE: People speaking Yiddish, or . . . SACHS: Uh, no, there were, most of them, but sure, most of them were Yiddish, but there were some others as well. DANE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. When you came through and gave them your name, what was it at that point? SACHS: Oh, I was saying my name was ( he laughs ) my name was Shmuel Michel. DANE: Could you spell it? SACHS: Samuel Michael, Michel, Schmuel Michel. I had two names, two, named after, after, uh, the prophets Samuel and Michael. Michael means, in Jewish, "like God." Michael, who is like God. And Schmuel, I don't know for a translation for that, but that's what it was. Schmuel Michel Zash. And maybe you want to know about that. Shass is what my name really was. Not Zash. DANE: And that's S-A-S-S. SACHS: It's an abbreviation. See, my father, he used to study what you call the entire set of Bibles, like you have a set of books, and it's called a shass gemora, it's sixty. If you finish the sixty gemoras you're as good as being a rabbinical man. And he had all the sixty, sixty gemoras. It was a whole set. And he used to lead the, lead, relieve the people there. DANE: And that was called a Sass? SACHS: A Shass. DANE: And that's how you had your last name? Is that where you . . . SACHS: That's my, that is my last name, was, over here it became Sachs, S-A-C-H-S. That's why I go here by Milton Sachs. DANE: How did you get the idea to change your name? SACHS: Oh. ( he laughs ) I'm not going to mention that one. DANE: Oh, you're not going to tell me? SACHS: Oh, do you believe it? Should I tell her. DANE: It's such a fun story. SACHS: Oh, when I came over here, my name was Michael Zass, you see, it's a Shass, it's not a Zass. And I said, so my cousin said then, "My gosh, you're not gonna call the name Zass. They're gonna call you Michael's ass." ( they laugh ) DANE: I love that story. I love, how did you come up with Sachs, then? Did she suggest it, your cousin, or . . . SACHS: Oh, Sachs is, um, Sachs, Sass, I don't know, uh, see, the cousins came and turned over, they took us over, they made. DANE: They helped you get, find your way. SACHS: That's right. Then we, we moved over, in a very nice place. Everybody had a home for us, and it was a nice, uh, a nice kitchen with an icebox in the back, where the man used to go outside and say, "Iceman, iceman." I know that's before your time. And, uh, and my mother came, and she was, became the leader of the tribe. Because she was, had nine children here, and she was really running the show. DANE: And they were all in Chicago now? SACHS: All in Chicago. DANE: What was that homecoming like? Can you describe it? SACHS: Oh, yes. We had a family situation. And the family was just terrific. And there was a home already rented for us, and they, they took me exceptionally, to stay with somebody else overnight, and his name is Sammy, he's the friend who, the one who wrote my memoirs. Sammy Sachs, see. And also he had Sass, and I think, to Sammy Sachs, and he, um, uh, I told him, I keep on telling him that he, I slept with him, but he got, he made me, he wetted my pants. ( he laughs ) You shouldn't publish that. DANE: It doesn't matter. When . . . SACHS: He was like that. He denies it. DANE: Today, he still . . . SACHS: Yes, he denies it. DANE: When did you become an American citizen? SACHS: Oh, came, uh, right after the six, six years after, then you had to learn all about the American, uh, regulations and laws, and I appeared and I became, I became an, a citizen. DANE: What was that day like for you? SACHS: Oh, that was a day of celebration. It was really. Boy, that I went through, 'course, then I went through, as you know, I went through, maybe you know, I went through engineering. DANE: When you first came, what kind of work did you do? Did you find a job? SACHS: Yes. I got a very big job. See, my ambition was to, oh, yes. I used to, I came over here with the idea that I was coming here and my family would send me to, would send me to, uh, school, and I would learn right away and I'd become, oh, yes, I always thought I would become an engineer, because I was able to count the pennies, I figured I could become an engineer. But basically my mind, later, I found out later, I was more a philosopher, a philosopher, and not an engineer. But I did go to the engineering. So i went to work for eight dollars a week and I, and I succeeded in that very nicely. As a matter of fact, the owner. DANE: I'm going to stop you just for a second. We're going to change tapes. This is the end of side one with Milton Sachs. It's 3:20. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO DANE: Side two, Milton Sachs, number 64. It is 3:25. We'll pick up, you were talking about the owner of the business of the first job. SACHS: Yes. Um, I once had a neighbor by the name of Peters. He was a Russian Jew. Maybe you heard the musician Piadagorsky. Piadagorsky family. And he was a very, he tried to help me and educate me. Although he didn't, uh, to make sure that, uh, my brother worked for him before, that's why I got the job. Matter of fact, my brother, when I told my brother that I want to go to school and become this, he says, "Look, first you work," he says. "If you want, you become an engineer, you become a doctor, everyone else, you do the same damn thing." So I was disappointed, but I worked. When I went to work there. And that little Piada, Peters, was his name, he would never let me use the, count the register. My pay was eight dollars a week. And one day, when I used to do that, give money back to the customers, I would put it in a little box. One day he gave me nine dollars instead of eight and he didn't tell me. I put it in my pocket, and I came back. the next day I says, "Mr. Peters, you gave me nine dollars." He says, "I did? Now you can use the register." DANE: That was a good day. That was a great. And when did you start learning to speak English? SACHS: Oh, English, at that time there was, of course, if there was Jewish immigration, there was a lot of, a lot of schools that they used to teach Jewish kids how to read English in a hurry. And I, I took the course first in Chicago, on Chicago avenue, and I made this in, in about no time I could spell. Ninety-nine percent of the time, I was always right. And then I went to another school, that was preparatory school, and that prepared me to go to college, in which I studied, um, in which I studied very hard. And I was, uh, very, I was very good about it. My algebra and the whole works was just, good. And, um, matter of fact, um, in one place, one of my teachers thought I was so smart, and, uh, I took it at the Jewish institute, and at that time there was a couple of boys were killed in Chicago because there was something. I forgot the name. She was afraid I might be just one of those boys, so. She was worried about me. I was too smart. Then I used to stay there till two, three o'clock in the morning, fall asleep, sometimes walk in the street with a towel on my head in order to keep, uh. Then I, all I had to do was take, because in order to get high school, to get a degree, at the University of Illinois, didn't have to go to it. All you had to do was actually take the examination at the University of Illinois and you got it, you were able to go to college. DANE: How long did it take you to be able to pass the high school degree? SACHS: I don't know. I'll tell you, my problem was, maybe two years back, my problem was that I, I knew the German, you had to get foreign, you had to get languages. I knew the languages of German very well. I had four years of German. So I, I knew it. I couldn't translate well. I knew the German, but it was the English, because I knew the, but it didn't take me very long, I don't remember exactly now. Yes. But enough that about 1928, I was already entered in Elementary Technology as an engineer. DANE: As an engineer. Goodness. Did, was it hard to adjust to America, to the culture here, to the city, to . . . SACHS: Except for the anti-Semitism. There was anti-Semitism. I was very hurt one day when I was working, as I was graduated from Elementary Technology, and, um, I was, uh, they announced that Western Union is hiring young engineers, and as I walked up the stairs, my teacher, upstairs, he says, "Milton, there's no sense for you to go, because you won't get accepted. You're Jewish." I got so damn mad I went back there, and I fill out the form, and they asked what nationality I am, and I put J-E-W-I-S-H. And then, of course, I didn't get the job. Then I went to get the job in another place in Chicago, and the guy was so nice to me and let me sit down. "Oh," he says, "you sure have a good record, so." Then, when he got through, he says to me, "Are you Jewish?" I says, "Yes." "I'm sorry, we don't hire the Jews." DANE: How did that make you feel after you'd left Lithuania, and all the persecution there? SACHS: Well, it was, um, it was a hard feeling, but that doesn't stop me. I just went right on. And I graduated, and I joined the government. Joined the government. And I worked for the government from, uh, actually about fifty years, I think. SACHS: And you were a hydrologist engineer? SACHS: I was a hydrologist. I was, I used to do, uh, all the hydrogeological surveys. And I, and that's what took me to all these countries. I went to, to Havana for three years, but I went back because I, and I worked for hopefully, I put in some like fifty years, for the United States government. But the end I received a great award. I got a gold medal. DANE: That's wonderful. At what point did you feel like an American and not a Lithuanian any more? SACHS: Uh, I felt that an, uh, matter of fact I was American all the time because, uh, I, matter of fact, I used to, uh, protect some of the, uh, anti-Semites. There was one fellow who was a, he was complaining that I'm drinking wine on Saturday, he thought there was something bad about it and he complained and on and on. I was, uh, I was very accepted by, we used to have friends, (?) and all, (?). Matter of fact, I have so many non-Jewish people that, blacks. I was the only one that hired a black for me. DANE: Hmm. Going from never seeing one to being in a position to hire a black person. SACHS: Yes. And I hired a black woman and I hired a, well, it was, to me it was no question, Jewish or non-Jewish and, um, I was succeeded. DANE: And your feelings about America as a country, how would you describe how you view this country? SACHS: Oh, I view this country, as a great democracy, and I want to keep it that way. I think it's wonderful. I'm not happy with a lot of things that's happening, but I think that this is a, this is my country, this is my people, this is where we were all born and raised and, uh, if we're ready, we have to go to war. We will go to war. But I mean, my children are, well, uh, oh, in fact, my son was, met the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, and he went to Berkeley, went to Western Pennsylvania. He was also, uh, let's see what else he did. DANE: He did an awful lot. SACHS: He did an awful lot, sure. Oh, he worked for Kissinger, during the war, for Kissinger. He used to go over to, in, one time with the, with the, what was that war we got involved? DANE: Vietnam War? SACHS: Vietnam. Went to Vietnam War. He went out to measure all the availability of food. No, he was under Kissinger, before he got with Kissinger, they had an interview with him, and he passed the test. I used to come to visit him, in a special office. And before I got able to get in, Billie and I, we used to have to get a, we used to have to get a ticket to get in, had to get permission, but I was in his office. DANE: Hmm. Amazing. SACHS: By the way, he was the Deputy Secretary of the Interior and some of my people, that were in charge of me, they now worked for him. ( he laughs ) DANE: That's great. Do you think it's important for your grandchildren to remember where you came from? SACHS: Yes. I think it's very important. I think that's one of the reasons I wrote my books. It's not so much for people, of the elderly. I do want the people, the young, my grandchildren, not grandchildren, excuse me, my great-grandchildren, to know the origin, where they come from, and the values we have, and I think this is the reason why I'm writing the stories. They should know who they are. And the better they understand each other, to this day, my family's not religious, by the way, neither am I. I'm not a religious man. But I got strongly identify with my Jewish life. We celebrate the causes with the holidays that are very dear to us. Particularly, like Hanukkah, you know anything about Hanukkah? We celebrate Hanukkah, we celebrate Passover. Those are great moments of our life. If you read, uh, well, I won't go into more on that. DANE: That was wonderful. Going back to when you first came, b that made me think of things that you grew up with, this is a very basic question, about the clothes that you had on. Were the clothes that you wore in Lithuania different from what your cousins and brothers were wearing here in the United States? ( he laughs ) Did you look different? SACHS: Uh, I imagine I did, because my family would make sure that I had the proper clothes. I don't remember, I wore, I didn't, especially when I was young, I got some pictures. As a matter of fact, I ought to, recently I looked at some pictures. I was a very handsome young fellow ( he laughs ) in my clothes. I didn't have to worry about clothes. DANE: Uh-huh. I think we're almost at the end. There was one thing you wrote in your memoirs about the HIAS daughter who sang the song. And you said that someone, either you said it, or someone said it, do you r what I'm trying to get at that maybe America isn't so goyish after all? SACHS: That's right. That's right. DANE: Do you remember that? Do you . . . SACHS: Yeah, I remember that. See, they were, met me here and they were coming to, uh, they were coming home. That's right. DANE: Is there anything that I'm forgetting to ask you, thought that you've come up with over your long life here in this country, and . . . SACHS: Uh, I don't know. I think I've said enough about my, my, enough about my background and, uh, I should say that I was very fortunate to, uh, also to meet the, uh, to meet a young wife like I have here, Billie, who I succeeded with the help of her mother ( he laughs ), marry me, and we're still married now, for how many years, Billie? Don't say that. ( they laugh ) We're married since, we married in 1931 or '32, I guess. DANE: So, that's fifty years. SACHS: That's the first thing she wanted. She says we gotta take a trip to Europe or, and we did, eventually, five years. After five years we went to, on a trip to Europe. DANE: Did you go back to Gelvan on that trip? SACHS: No, no, no. We went to, uh, we went, and we went that time we went to, oh, I think we visited Moscow, I guess, Poland, and, uh, Germany. And that's the time we visited, we were fortunate that we, we helped bring over a cousin of mine who survived the, survived the, didn't get involved with the, with the, with the Nazi Holocaust. And one girl, to this day, writes me letters. We succeeded in bringing her home. We helped her get here. To this day, she says Milton, if it wasn't for you, I would not be alive. So we succeeded, we met her in Kovno, yeah, we met her there, and, um, and also she remembers one of my brothers went to become a, a rabbinical student, and he became much more liberal. DANE: When you went to Poland and the Soviet Union, were you there long enough to make any assessment of the difference of life from here and there? SACHS: Yes, we did. As a matter of fact, we met, we met my old teacher. An old, there was an old teacher of mine that taught me when I was there. And he was very unhappy what's happening to the, to the whole thing there, he says it's Stalin and all the others, says, you can't, there was a (unintelligible) at that time, and he, he had very, he had a very great doubts about what the fortunes of the Jews are in Moscow. DANE: Did you feel lucky to be an American? SACHS: Yes. DANE: One final question that may be related to your religion, but may not be. Coming from another country, um, different countries have different customs. Different food, different, um, celebrations, different superstitions, different sayings. Did you bring any customs to this country, do you think? Did your family? SACHS: Customs? Oh, I think we have, the custom is to be, be, to your, decent to your relatives, to your, to your, decent to your, to your fellow man, be courteous and have respect, for example here, we have black people here who are helping us, I respect them just like they were our own. We, uh, in Pakistan, we serve Pakistanis. We treat 'em all as human beings and have no, whatever, no racial hate of whatever, whatever kind. I think we're all born equal and it's a certain beauty about, about being an assortment of people. I have no feeling whatsoever. No animosity or anything. The only thing, I hope we have the right people to lead us. DANE: Not always easy. I think that that's about it. O.J., can you think of anything else? When you left Ellis Island and were on your way to Detroit, how did you get there, how did you get off the island? SACHS: Oh, we went on a train. It was raining. We went on a train, and it was raining, we went on a train, it was going for such a long time, it was going and going and going, and finally, finally a nephew of my mother's jumped the gun. See, the children were waiting at the end of the train in Chicago, everybody was waiting. Even my young nephew, a young kid that was about thirteen years of age, and, uh, they were all waiting, and this character, who knew my mother when he was still, he was born, jumped the gun and took a train ahead of time, and met my mother, and he met the, went on the train and says, Auntie (Yiddish). See? DANE: Yeah, that's exciting. SACHS: Then we all came, saw the family, and there was a lot of kissing and hugging. DANE: Such a reunion, all of them in one place. SACHS: All in one place. The whole family. And then we came home, and they made us a big party at home, and it was a great moment in our life. DANE: All Americans. SACHS: But I'm devoted, dedicated to the proposition, that my great nieces and great nephews should understand their origin. The better they understand this the happier they would be. I didn't have to tell it to my sisters and brothers. You were going to say? Ask a question? DANE: Your wife Billie. She was an American, wasn't she? SACHS: She was American born, and, uh, I was studying for was my final examination and, uh, uh, Florence, this is my niece, used to know her. She said, "I want you to come meet my, my, my friend." And she came over there, and here I was studying for my examination, I says for Christ sake, of all times she's got to bring the girl. Now see, we were both arguing. And I had a nephew of mine, Jerry, who's still alive. And we were arguing who in the Dickens should take her home? I said, "You take her home or I take her home." We didn't want to take her home. So on the way home, on the way, on the, finally we took the elevated in Chicago, and we both took her home. So I asked her the address, or telephone number. I finally got, she wanted to, in touch, she's not (Yiddish). I thought she was nice, see. I asked for her telephone number, she wouldn't give it to me. But she gave it to Jerry, I think. DANE: Okay, your cousin. SACHS: No, my nephew. She gave it to Jerry. And then, and then, called her up, and we went to, one time, to Ravinia park, that's in Chicago. And I didn't have enough money to take both of them, so I took Florence and Millie, both of them, two friends, and we took turns, the girls took turns to see the opera in Ravinia Park, Chicago. DANE: And you had, how many tickets did you have? SACHS: I had two tickets. DANE: For three people. ( they laugh ) And you saw the opera? SACHS: Yes. But I took turns. She still reminds me of that. ( he laughs ) Cheap date. DANE: That's wonderful. And then you got married? SACHS: And then we got married. But, with the help of her mother. She's, she was calling for your mother. Apparently she helped me, I'm sure of that b she used to, uh, she used to say, she liked me very much, she used to tell me. Whenever she saw us, we were in the living room, she would say, "Kinder, uh, children, you want a little milk?" And then, when we came to, she came to, we couldn't afford to come and pick her up, so she came to Chicago, to Washington, she came to Washington. We found, we found five dollar bills, ten dollar bills, her mother put it in a quilt for her. So we decided to celebrate. That's all the money we had at that time. We decided to celebrate, so we went to New York. And we went to New York, I forgot the name, which hotel, I forgot. Roosevelt Hotel, I think, I forgot. Very exclusive hotel at that time. And I said, "Let's go ahead and eat," and I showed her down the basement, there was a basement there to eat in, and I go over there, and I saw the guy, a big man, there, like this, and I says, "Let's get the hell out." And we ate someplace else. We ate someplace else. That's the story. DANE: Did it make any difference to you that you were marrying an American woman who was born here as opposed to someone who'd come from your village or town, your background? SACHS: No, it wasn't, uh, no, it wouldn't make a difference. It's because I did have some girlfriends, but we used to have meetings all the time. Friends of ours used to get together and discuss all kinds of politics, (?) and all this, they were Americans and not Americans, but, uh, for whatever reasons, it wasn't the fact that she was American. I think, the fact it was Billie. She was cute, she was nice, she was, uh, the values that I had, her, her sister was very intelligent, she had musician in the family, um, and it was harp players and so-and-so, and that was attested to the, to the wealth, or the happiness in the family. And her brother a doctor, and I don't know why, but I was obviously, I think it was she who was attracted me over the others. DANE: Was music an important part in the upbringing of your family and your culture? SACHS: Yes. It still is. Music is still, to this day. Both of us. Music and art. By the way, see, you'll notice all this painting, this is all, most of it, is Billie's. And she's, just, uh, as you can tell, some of the work is, not this one, this I bought in the Coconut Gallery, but some of the work she does. No, this is Coconut Gallery. This is my horses, so all this is hers. All this is, they're all of Billie's paintings. DANE: Wonderful. SACHS: You know what? This here, this is also Billie's over here. Billie's over here, too. DANE: Yeah. Okay. Let me cut the tape. Okay, I'm going to slate the tape. Tell me when. This is Debbie Dane, the end of side two, the interview with Milton Sachs, number 64. It's 4:40, we're in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
