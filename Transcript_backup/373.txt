SIGRIST: Good afternoon. This is Paul Sigrist for the National Park Service. Today is Tuesday, June 29, 1993. I am here with Matilda michele, who came from Italy in 1921 when she was twenty-one. Also present is her daughter, Ann Samartino. You may feel free to interject if you feel it necessary. Anyway, I'm happy to be here, and can we begin by you giving me your birth date. michele: July 9, 1899. SIGRIST: So you're almost going to have a birthday pretty soon. Can you tell me, Mrs. michele, where you were born in Italy? michele: Italy, a small town, was named Casi. Teano was the city, in provincia de Napoli. SIGRIST: Okay. So it was somewhere near Naples then, in that province. What was the name of the town again? michele: Casi. SIGRIST: Can you spell that? ( Mrs. michele laughs ) Or Anne, can you spell it? SAMARTINO: I always think it's C-A-S-I. SIGRIST: Please speak full voice. C-A-S-I. Casi. michele: Casi. SIGRIST: The "S" is like a "Z," sort of. michele: Yeah. SIGRIST: Casi. And you said that it was near a larger town? michele: It was a smaller town. It's a city that we belong, Teano. SIGRIST: Teano. michele: Teano. SIGRIST: T . . . SAMARTINO: T-E-A-N-O. SIGRIST: T-A-N-O, [sic] okay. michele: In provincia de Napoli. SIGRIST: De Napoli, right. Can you describe for me the town that you were born in, what it looked like when you were a girl? michele: ( she laughs ) When I was givel. We was in the house all the time. On the land we work all the time when we grow up over there. SIGRIST: So you were on a farm. michele: Yeah, like, just like. Over there you see somebody that don't got no land, they rent it. Just like yours. You plant everything you need over there. SIGRIST: What kinds of things do they grow in Italy? What did you grow on your farm? michele: What we grow, we grow grain, we plant the grain on November, and we got to cut them in July. Phew! ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: It's hard work, huh? michele: We plant the corn, we plant the potatoes, we plant the tomatoes, we plant the (?). We plant everything over there, what we need. We put the tomatoes. When they're ripe good we pick it up, we boil in a nice kettle, and we make a tomato paste ourselves. There was the tomatoes. SIGRIST: Now, did you grow only one kind of tomatoes, or were there several different kinds of tomatoes? michele: A lot, no. There's two kinds. Like the plum tomatoes are the wrong one, you know, the wrong one. But we plant everything. SIGRIST: Did women work in the fields as well as men? michele: Oh, the women and men and little kids, they work over there. SIGRIST: Everybody worked. michele: My brother and my father. When I grow up I worked just the same. My brother, my younger brother, when my mother died I was ten, my brother was fourteen. SIGRIST: What did your mother die of? michele: I don't know. I was young. Over there they no talk about it, so. SIGRIST: What do you remember about your mother's death? michele: I remember nice, a nice thing. They used to teach us to do everything over there, to cook. When my mother die, just like my mother was over there, because we knew everything. We used to make the bread. That was . . . SIGRIST: How did you make bread? michele: With the flour, the grain. Because we'd go to the shop, we'd grind it and make the flour. SIGRIST: And this is the grain that you grew. michele: Yeah, that we planted. We screen and make the flour nice and make the bread, seven, eight loaf of bread like this. ( she gestures ) And we got the oven in the house, on the corner. We put all of the branches of the trees, you know, we make it nice, that's all brick inside. After we clean, then we put the bread. You've got to know how to put. One in the back, one over here, one over here and one over here, and they cook nice. SIGRIST: How often would you make bread? michele: Well, in summertime, on the summer we didn't used to make too much. SIGRIST: Because it's so hot. michele: It's so hot. We make four, three, four loaf. In the wintertime it was six or seven loaf of bread. SIGRIST: How long would eight loaves of bread last you? michele: Well, a couple of days. Depends, we eat over there. We don't measure the food. I laugh when I coming over here. Somebody measure the food, how much they got, how many people. Over there you fill it up the pan, that's all. SIGRIST: Did you eat much meat in Italy? michele: No, we don't buy a lot of meat. We kill the pig over there. SIGRIST: How did you kill a pig? michele: Three, four men, they (?). They put on the board, a big board like that, the pig. They get a big pan and cut. ( she laughs ) And we make the blood sausage. SIGRIST: Make a blood sausage. michele: You cook some rice, you put in there. You put all the flavors and make it cook nice, make blood sausages. SIGRIST: But in general you didn't eat a lot of meat. michele: The pork, we make, the center of the pork we call proscuitto. Bacon, we got the hole on the top, you know, to fill it. Lots of (?). (?) ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Now, did you raise the animals yourself? michele: Huh? SIGRIST: Did you have animals on your farm? michele: Yeah. SIGRIST: You had a pig? michele: Yeah, a few. SIGRIST: A few pigs. michele: The donkey, he was big. He had to carry all of the food home, the land was so far, with a big sack. We could put it on the saddle. He had to walk. SIGRIST: Did the donkey have a name? michele: Huh? SIGRIST: Did your donkey have a name? SAMARTINO: The donkey, Ma. michele: Cheech. We used to call her Cheech, like Francesca. Say, "Cheech, Cheech." He stopped right away. Soon we got to the place where we've got to carry the stuff home. We look, "Cheech, come on." Come right over there, put on the saddle, and put a big sack on the shoulder, the poor thing. SIGRIST: So he was kind of like a pet in a way. michele: Yeah. And we were take care over there. They ate nice, all the food nice. SIGRIST: Is that what you remember that really sticks out in your mind is the food, in Italy you had great food when you lived there? michele: Yeah. Over there a lot of fruit, a lot of everything. SIGRIST: Yeah. Well, can you describe the house that you lived in for me? michele: The house? It was a big, over there was two doors downstairs. They build a house with like a sink in the floor over there. Then walk in. The two doors, and one step. After, bigger space. After the step you go upstairs. We had eight or nine steps before we go in the house up the stairs. One room over here. Over there was a big oven in the corner over there the kitchen, over there one room, over there the other room. And the kitchen my father opened the door, to go out the other side. We had another bigger room over there. We used to hang the clothes. My brother, he come to America. I was all alone there in the big house. I don't like that. SIGRIST: Now, what was your dad's name? michele: Huh? SIGRIST: What was your dad's name, your father? michele: Raphael. SIGRIST: Raphael. And then you had your mother. What was her name? michele: My mother was named Alessandria. SIGRIST: And what was her maiden name? michele: Before she married my father? SIGRIST: Before she got married. michele: Annazo. SIGRIST: Can you spell that? michele: I-A, two N's, and Z. SIGRIST: So A-N, Annazo. michele: Annazo. SIGRIST: Annazo. A-N-N-A-Z-O. SAMARTINO: I-Z-N-O. SIGRIST: I-Z-N-O. And your name, before you were married? michele: Was Izzo. My father's name. SIGRIST: I-Z-Z-O. michele: I-Z-Z-O. SIGRIST: So your dad's name was Raphael Izzo. Tell me a little bit about your father. What was his background? michele: Oh, my father, he used to have two jobs. He used to work with the lumber company. He used to work in the shop when they picked up all the leaves. They grind over there, they squeeze it with the machine. The oil coming out. They put a little hot water, a big place like this, the oil run all the way in there. Over there like a little canal, with big tanks under the ground. They used to go with a stepladder over there to pick it up, the oil. My father said, "You've got to have a steady hand, because a little water is over there." Because the water, put it on, make the oil coming out nice. You've got to go on the top, nice. And no go deep, you catch the water, too, and you carry the oil home. You got a nice tank on the corner. When you fill it up, you got enough for the whole year. And the rest, we sell it. SIGRIST: So he made money doing that? michele: With the potatoes it was just the same. So much potatoes, you save so many sack of potatoes, and the rest you sell. With the corn, you do everything. SIGRIST: So you basically kept what you needed, and then sold off the rest. michele: That's it. SIGRIST: Was there like a public market in town? michele: Yeah. We go in the city. SIGRIST: Oh. Describe what that was like for me, going to sell your vegetables. michele: Yeah. Especially on a Saturday they used to have a big sale. Everybody used to go sell. We sell a chicken, you sell eggs, the milk. Over there, before you sell them, the veterinarian coming, and then the (?), with two police officers, and they test the eggs. And over here a couple of months ago I see on the TV that the eggs, the eggs are shaking a little bit, they're not fresh. SIGRIST: And there was someone who did that then, too. michele: You got to get it nice, everything. They used to check up everything just the same. SIGRIST: How did you get to town when you wanted to go to town? michele: We got the jackass when we needed. We have a big, like a bushel, like this. Put all of the stuff in there, make so many things over here. You put in there, they put that thing over here, and walk. SIGRIST: So Cheech would have to take everything to town. michele: Yeah. It wasn't too much, you know. We sell cheese and nuts, you know. We used to, big sack with three bushels, we get use of that thing. SIGRIST: Did you make baskets and things? Did you make the baskets that you put things in? michele: No, we buy the basket, yeah. We buy that. SIGRIST: Can you tell me what your father's personality was like? What was his character like? michele: Well, he was pretty good. Over there, they are very strict. Oh, God! ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: How would your father be strict with you when you were a girl? michele: Well, he was nice. He work all the time. I can't say no. He worked all the time. Yeah. SIGRIST: What did he look like? michele: Well, he looked like my son Ralph a little bit. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Describe in words. michele: He was a husky man, a nice man. SIGRIST: What color hair? michele: A little dark brown or something like that. SIGRIST: Did he have a moustache or anything like that? michele: No. SIGRIST: No? michele: Me, I have the nose like my father. I'm glad my kids, nobody got a nose like him. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Now, tell me a little bit about your mother. She died when you were ten. michele: Yeah. SIGRIST: What was her background? Did she come from this town? michele: No. She was from over there, the same town. You know, over there you don't go no place. She marry, that's all. SIGRIST: Do you know how, do you know how she met your father? michele: Eh, if you go downstairs on the other side, they're all over there, the holiday. You got out to the church on a holiday, they're all over there. They're know all each other, that's why. They get married, nobody part away. All of the same place. SIGRIST: Do you know what year they got married? michele: No, I no remember that. SIGRIST: And what was your mom's personality like, as you remember it? michele: I remember that she was a very clean. That's all I remember lots. In summertime I do myself, my bed, you know, when I see I got to go and help and pick up the bed, I got to look at the bedspread, a little wrinkle. I had to crease it nice. She was so clean, I don't mean maybe. SIGRIST: How did she clean the house? How did she . . . michele: With her hands! You got the hands and the broom over there, that's all. ( she laughs ) No vacuum cleaner, no this or that. She used to wash her clothes. SIGRIST: How did she do the laundry? michele: We got a lot of (Italian), we called, with the water, you know, that would run. You take the clothes, you go over there with the soap. The stones lying there, a little rub, scrub with the hands like we scrubbed over here years ago in the tub. ( she laughs ) And washing board. SIGRIST: It's hard work. michele: I did it. SIGRIST: What kind of clothes did you wear in Italy? michele: Used the same over here. I used all my clothes when I come in America. The skirt, it was the same. The suit with the jacket, the blouse. I say, "Why I got to go buy some clothes here? What I got to do with this? I got to throw it away?" ( she laughs ) No, I use it right over here, bring that over here. The skirt is the same. I said, "No, I use." After, I buy. SIGRIST: Did you make your clothes in Italy? michele: No. The dressmaker make it. We don't buy all made over there. All the clothes and all the shoes.

When you go put it on it's nice on your feet. Not tight over there and loose over here. The clothes, it's just the same. You go in the story, you buy so many yards. The dressmaker, she ask you the way you want the clothes, that's how much yards you've got to buy. SIGRIST: Did the dressmaker come to your house? michele: A long knife. No, you go to the city. SIGRIST: You go to her. michele: It's the city, yeah. If you want the full skirt, if you want the one that used to dress, or two piece, everything. SIGRIST: Was it expensive? Was it expensive to have your clothes made? michele: No, not too much. They used to like it, the people in the small town. They used to bring a lot of things to the woman. Was named Christina.

And he say, "Well," he say, "one day you start to be bigger girl and now pretty soon you get marry, I'll be all alone." He say, "I want to get marry." I no care if he get marry another woman of that place, from the city. No. I say, "If you get marry again, I no call the woman 'mom.' She's not my mother." I say, "My mother died." My father was surprised because you no talk over there. ( she laughs ) I say, "If she come over here, she thinks she boss me around," I say, "she better think about it." ( she laughs ) My father have a surprise. I have a surprise, too, because he no slap like this. SIGRIST: He was probably so surprised. michele: He think I was right as he start to think. Telling me she have two sisters-in-law I think. Why nobody wanted it there? Because over here, just like a family. I no care. (?) No, here somebody was a (?), but they no want.

He no asking me if I want to go America or no. Why he no ask me, huh? Sometimes they said the kids are that bad, you never know. Why? He don't have the place to say, asking me. She telling me no go America, she make tell the woman to me. I told them everything they wanted. I say, "Well, she tell my father. My father . . ." SIGRIST: He was very upset. michele: I say, "He started that, I going to finish." He make me go out, just like he threw me out of the house. I say, "I go America." That's all.

I say, "Ninety-one." ( she laughs ) The man look at me. They make everything. If you make a mistake, they put you on the side. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO SIGRIST: When you, do you remember the name of the boat that you took, that you got on? michele: The name? SIGRIST: The name of the boat. michele: When I go on Napoli, I look at that. I told the man, "You got to have somebody, you got to present, you're working for the state." I said, "Where I go?" Canada was the name. I said, "Where I go, Canada or America, my brother?" "Oh, no, no, you go America." They go every port, every nationality. I say, "Canada? I no go Canada."

( they laugh ) See if it was nice, all the (?) on the bottom. Very nice, it was, all the (?). SIGRIST: Were you traveling by yourself, or were there other people from the town that were with you? michele: No. Nobody was, nobody from the town when I go. One girl, she had to come in, too. She had two sisters, one brother. In a few months they passed the law, because the people didn't know how to read and write, they cannot go to America. Because a lot of people, there's three step over there. If you make me sick, you get the wrong step, you go to Cuba. A lot of people, they used to go to Cuba, they have a hard time if they find it out. But when you know what it is, I think that number, the street, where you got to go, that street, over there. That's where you go. SIGRIST: That's interesting. michele: Yeah. SIGRIST: One thing I forgot to ask you while we were still in Italy, and it just occurs to me now, can you tell me a little bit about how Italy was affected by World War One and how your life was affected by World War One. michele: No. SIGRIST: Not much? michele: No. It was bad because I see a lot of my cousins go, you know. My brother. My brother, he was there three years when he was single. You got to go over there. You reach twenty-one, you got to go in the service. After, he was forty-four years old, he had to go again, the second war, with two kids. Yeah. SIGRIST: But your family was not affected by World War One at all. michele: No. SIGRIST: All right. So you're on the Canada, and you're on your way to America. ( they laugh ) Tell me what you remember about being on the boat. What was there to do? michele: I remember. They bring you the food. They used to cook good, yeah. To me was a friend of my brother in Massachusetts. His brother, he was the best man when my brother, when he marry, and my brother, he wasn't home yet, at the shop. And we go to the mother and father house over there, his name Emilio. And the fellow's wife was sick, was sick a lot in the boat, because they had to put in the hospital. And we got to go in the hospital when we come, checkup, everything, and she no pass. She still was sick, and she was, we leave her in the hospital in New York. SIGRIST: That was at Ellis Island. michele: Yeah, we leave her there. SIGRIST: Do you . . . michele: Me, I used to eat, go on the top, on the porch, and look over the water, watch all the water come.

They go on the bigger steamboat over there. After the first class, second class, after that everybody. When we reach over there, we had to go in the hospital. SIGRIST: What did they do to you in the hospital at Ellis Island? michele: We had to walk up and down the Battery, in the cold, up and down. When we reach the hospital, we go in the hospital. But the watchman is by the door. Just the people, they come from the other country to go in the hospital, nobody else. Checkup, you've got to show the passport, the name. And they give you, the man, they give you the ticket. I say, "What I got to go to the movie?" ( she laughs ) I go in there, the nurse, the doctor, to make it just like every small place, you know, with the curtains. I think over there they got to check up all the people. Then we got to . . . SIGRIST: Did you have to take a shower, or anything like that? michele: No. I take a shower on the ship, yeah. But when the doctor tell me unbutton your blouse. Oh, I say, "My God!" ( she laughs ) I say, "I come to America, this man going!" I never remember be sick, I never remember go to the doctor. Who go to the doctor? You eat, work, everything, you eat. SIGRIST: So that was very shocking, actually, to have to take your clothes off. michele: Yeah. The nurse, she look to me. I, she laugh. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: She was used to it. michele: Yeah. You got to see the eyes. Bup, upside down, they turn up there. And then you hear, your lungs. The boat, after, they give you the syringe. I say that's all.

You know, we take the train twelve o'clock in the night in New York, to go to Boston. We take the train to Boston. We stop at Boston, we had to take another train. We go to South Lawrence. After South, we have to get off and take another train to go Lawrence. I'll never forget. The man say, "Lawrence, Lawrence." I say, "(?)." We come out, then we walk. Second Street to the center of Lawrence, Massachusetts. He was about over two miles the street, beautiful. Two lines with the car, you know, over there. Over there, in the middle, that piece was all nice grass, all small trees. It was so beautiful. SIGRIST: When you were, did someone meet you at Ellis Island? Did your brother come and meet you at Ellis Island? michele: No, not over there. We go over there, with the train. We change, after that we walk to go to my brother. SIGRIST: How did you know what train to get on? How did you know? michele: They tell you, they say the stop. Stop in Boston, and stop in South Lawrence until we reach Lawrence. At twelve o'clock in the day time, you believe? SIGRIST: That's a long trip. michele: All the whistle blow the shop, they blow. That fellow say, "Now everybody stop their work." Somebody go eat out, and somebody eat in the shop, you know. SIGRIST: Do you remember seeing your brother for the first time? michele: Oh, yeah. It was a pretty long time. He was seventeen years old. After he was married, he have two kids, one died, the first one. SAMARTINO: ( Italian ) michele: ( Italian ) SIGRIST: When you saw your brother, when you first came to America . . . michele: Oh, it's nice, so nice. He cried, and I cried.

SIGRIST: Do you remember a hat? Did you wear a hat? SAMARTINO: No, no hat. SIGRIST: All right. So you got to Lawrence, and then what happened? How did you spend your first night with your brother in Lawrence? michele: My brother's house. SIGRIST: He had a house. michele: My brother's house. One week, I no say nothing. It was two weeks, I say, "What I do? I come in America? I stay in a house? When I got to work? When I got to go work?" You look all inside, you n see nothing. I see house and street. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: What's the first job that you got? michele: I go work in Washington Mill, a wind. I used to take care of twenty-five spools of wool. Walk up and down and tie, you know, it had to be all the same size, and take it off and put on the top, the shelf, with the machine. I used to have to take it off four times a day. I had to put on my number. I'll never forget. I had to make a hundred spools of that wool every day. I had like my number was fifty-five. I told there the woman, I say, "You know when I forget this number? When I die." ( she laughs ) Fifty-five, and fifty-five and fifty-five, and fifty-five. SIGRIST: So this is hard work, but a very different kind of work than what you were used to. michele: I don't know, I work, any kind of work never bother me, just like I work before, the job. SIGRIST: Do you remember how much you got paid for that first job? michele: ( she laughs ) We used to work ten hours a day, seven to six, five a day.

SIGRIST: Did you like America when you got here? michele: I liked it nice. SIGRIST: Did you miss Italy? michele: I missed what I had. But ( she laughs ), you know when you start, like even now, something wrong, you know. You live at somebody's house, you've got to watch nice. But when you're home, you relax. We fix, or we call somebody, they fix. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Did your father go ahead and get remarried? michele: No. SIGRIST: He didn't? michele: You know what he did?

He don't get marry, see. And my brother was in Italy, he write to us, me and my brother over there. My brother have a house, but his house was small, not like us. He say, "What I got to do? Go over there, sell the house and the land over there?" My brother say, "What do you say? You want to go back?" I said, "No." I come, they ask me in New York, "Are you coming to America?" They say, "Or you want to go back?" I said, "I'll stay here." Ha! The (?) everything you say. It was a tough coming upon New York. But what are you going to do? We go to the lawyer.

SAMARTINO: ( Italian ), Ma. michele: Yeah. ( Italian ) When we go to the house the fellow come the wife was sick. If we walked, you know, from the station, and they go to the mother's house. I saw her house, you know, the paint all fall off. I was surprised because the house, they got lumber over here, not stone. ( she laughs ). When we passed it was cool, it was pretty cool. It was April, and it was cool over here. Especially in Massachusetts. Very cool over here. SIGRIST: And you came in April, you said. michele: Yeah, April. SIGRIST: April of 1921. michele: I say, "Emilio?" He say, "Yes?" "This is America?"

SIGRIST: So food, the food was a disappointment. michele: Buy it here and buy it there and buy it there. I don't know what I'd do if I don't have her, my sister, my daughter-in-law. She ask me a lot of times, too. SIGRIST: So in America you have to buy things. SAMARTINO: She was used to getting everything from the farm. SIGRIST: That's right. You had everything you needed, didn't you, in Italy. michele: You know, I was surprised when I coming over here. You see where they got the plaque there on the old sides. There was a nice cherry tree over there. They cut down the cherry tree and they planted the wild tree. And now they had a tree, because the flag bent on the trees. It was torn. They put a new one, and painted the post, too. I said, "What, they are coo-coo over here. You cut down the cherry tree and plant the wild tree?" I don't know. To me it don't make sense. SAMARTINO: You don't cut fruit trees down in Italy. You plant more fruit trees. michele: The one that wanted the property, Mrs. Santinelli, when the cherry was ripe she used to call a few fellows, pick it up. They put in a basket. They put on the ground in the backyard where we used to live. "Come on, everybody." Everybody have a cherry, kids and everybody. All the people that was over there. Huh? They be able to do over here, all (?) the cherry. They plant the wild tree, the wild over there. I no can see. I don't see the cherry tree over there. It was right on the corner. I used to live over there. Tony Moses used to go on the porch, make the, get a branch or make it like a little hoop, and used to grab the branch and pick up the cherries. SIGRIST: We have just a couple of minutes left, and I want you do to something for us in Italian on tape, and I'm wondering, can you say maybe The Lord's Prayer in Italian, slowly, on the recording. michele: Yeah.

SIGRIST: What does that mean? michele: That mean you lay down in the bed with the Virgin Mary. If something happen, she got to wake me up, see. She dress up so nice, you know, with that thing and everything. We make the Cross so that God bless us. SIGRIST: Thank you for saying that. We need to end now, and I want to thank you very much for having me come out here and asking you a few questions. I really appreciate it. michele: Yeah. SIGRIST: This is Paul Sigrist signing off with Matilda michele. michele: I teach my kids, too. My daughter, my granddaughter. They used to say, "( Italian )" Which is (?) for God, you see. And ( Italian ). See? ( Italian ) SIGRIST: So you taught your children prayers in Italian, too. michele: They used to say, I don't know if they still say. I don't know. SAMARTINO: I do. SIGRIST: You still do. SAMARTINO: Yeah. michele: And you know who teach me that? When I was a little mother's sister was a widow. Their husband die, and every Saturday night she wanted me to go sleep to her house. She had a little girl too, like me. And she said, "Come on, we got to say the prayer now." And she used to say every night a few times. After I learn, when I used to go home I used to say, I keep saying till I was big, till now. SIGRIST: Well, it was a way that you could pass on the old world to the new world to your own children here in America. michele: Yeah. I say, I got to say. On the ship, nothing. (?) had enough. The fellow said, "If you no got enough, tell me. I'll go to the cucina. They'll give you what you want." So one day the nurse pass by. They used to give the soup to all of the kids, you know. I said like this. I said, "You, please," I say. "You give me cup of soup, too. See, I'm no bambina but I'm pretty young. He say, "Sure?" He say, "(Italian) no?" And she used to bring me a cup of soup every day with the noodles. SIGRIST: Well, you didn't get sick, so you could eat. michele: I eat. SIGRIST: Again, I want to thank you. michele: I never was sick. I don't know. SAMARTINO: ( Italian ) michele: I said, "My mother pray for me." SAMARTINO: ( she laughs ) What did I tell you, Paul?
