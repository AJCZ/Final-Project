REISBERG: Well, yes, my father, you know, he used to take my brother, you know, another son, you know, we used to go on a Saturday or Sunday to the pool; they call it a michva, to go bathing. You know, that sort of thing, you know, and we used to go. That's about all I can remember, I mean. LEVINE: Okay, well let me ask you some questions. What was your father's name? REISBERG: Abraham.

Why don't you tell me, as you just did, about on Sunday. REISBERG: My father used to take us, my brother and myself, in a horse and buggy. You know, white horses in front, you know, go riding on Sunday, you know. LEVINE: And he would take you-- REISBERG: To the michva. (He laughs.) LEVINE: And so, in other words, your father, this was kind of above and beyond the average person being able to go in a horse and buggy with the white horses. REISBERG: Yeah, the white horses, yeah. My father used to ride bareback, no saddle. He was pretty good. That I remember. LEVINE: And how about your mother? What did she used to do? REISBERG: Cook. (He laughs heartily.) LEVINE: Was she a good cook? REISBERG: Well, I don't know. (He laughs.) LEVINE: It was good to you. Do you remember any particular things she cooked? REISBERG: No, no.

REISBERG: That's comforter, yeah. LEVINE: And so she'd make a comforter and pillows-- REISBERG: Yeah, with the comforter, you know, it was cold there at night (he laughs), winter. LEVINE: And how did she make them? Do you remember the things that she did? REISBERG: No. I don't know who sewed them. I don't know, no. But I remember, you know, taking the feathers off the chickens, that they, what kind of chickens, young chickens, you know, the feathers are soft. LEVINE: Oh, and she would take the feathers off? REISBERG: I think she did. LEVINE: I see, and then you don't know if she sold those? REISBERG: Sold them, no. LEVINE: Did she sell the comforters?
