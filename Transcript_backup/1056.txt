MARCHIONE: When we came here. SIGRIST: Do you remember what he did in Italy? MARCHIONE: No, that I don't... SIGRIST: Don't remember anyone talking about it? MARCHIONE: Yeah. That I don't know. SIGRIST: I see. Now you said that your father came to America first. MARCHIONE: Yes. SIGRIST: When did he come? MARCHIONE: I, I think that he came in 1907 or 8, something like that. SIGRIST: Sometime around then. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: And, um, why did he come here? MARCHIONE: He came here because he, uh, my uncle, he was seventeen years old and my grandfather wanted my father to bring him back home, but he didn't want to come. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: He like it, America. SIGRIST: He liked it. What did he, um, um, you said he was in the ice business when he came here... MARCHIONE: Yes. SIGRIST: Um, so, um, what was your mother doing back in Italy? Was she working? MARCHIONE: No, my mother never worked. My father never sent her to work. SIGRIST: I see. Um, was he, was he sending her money? To live on? MARCHIONE: Oh yeah, oh yeah. SIGRIST: You were just a little girl. MARCHIONE: I was a little girl but we couldn't come here. My mother didn't get any money from my father. SIGRIST: I see, um, were there other people in your family? Did you have brothers and sisters? MARCHIONE: No, I didn't have nobody then. SIGRIST: I see. So it was just you and your mother over... MARCHIONE: Me and my mother and my sister. But then, when we came here, my father, you know, he worked. My mother never worked. SIGRIST: I see. Um... MARCHIONE: She had to watch the kids. (they laugh) SIGRIST: Um, when you were in Italy, um, did, um, do you remember your mother ever talking about, um, like where you lived in Italy? Did you... MARCHIONE: Oh yeah. I went to see her. SIGRIST: Did you, um, did you live in a house or an apartment... MARCHIONE: It was a house. But there was rooms like the fireplace. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: The bedrooms, the kitchen, we didn't have too much but we were comfortable. SIGRIST: Um, and, um, you mentioned something about grandparents. Did they live with you in Italy? In the same house? MARCHIONE: My grand..., my grandmother, my grandfather took care of us while my mother came here for her brother. And he didn't want to come and my grandfather passed away, he got ammonia (sic) and he passed away. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: And my mother says to my grandmother that she should come over here. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: With her. She didn't want to come. But it took a long time before she says "yes", that she would come. SIGRIST: That, excuse me, that your mother would come or that your grandmother would come with your mother? MARCHIONE: My grandmother would come with my mother. SIGRIST: Were these, were these your mother's parents or your father's parents? MARCHIONE: Yeah, no. SIGRIST: They were your mother's parents. MARCHIONE: Yeah. My father's parents, his father dead..., passed away and I, I don't how but, a, they was his mother, my other grandmother. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: And she used, we used to go there and she used to give us grapes, you know, what the woman could afford to give. SIGRIST: I see. Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: But she was nice. They were all nice. SIGRIST: I see. So did, so ultimately did your mother's mother come with you? MARCHIONE: No! SIGRIST: No, she didn't, she wouldn't come. MARCHIONE: After so many years, then she came. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: She was sixty-five, I think. SIGRIST: Before she made it over here. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: All right, let's, let's talk a little bit about coming over to America. MARCHIONE: Yes. SIGRIST: So your mother and your sister... MARCHIONE: My, yeah, my moth... SIGRIST: And you... MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Uh, decided to come to America. Your mother... MARCHIONE: Oh, my mother, yeah, because my father was here, I mean, and she didn't want to leave him alone. She wanted to cook for him and everything. SIGRIST: When, um, where did he live in America? MARCHIONE: Uh, 100th Street. SIGRIST: I see. So he stayed in New York when he came to... MARCHIONE: New York, and he found us apartment when we came. SIGRIST: O.K. Um, do you remember or do you remember your mother talking about what port you left from in Italy before you came over? MARCHIONE: What port? Well, I remember like they used to say, I, I was small... SIGRIST: You were just a kid. MARCHIONE: Uh, Naples, I think. SIGRIST: Did you leave from Naples? MARCHIONE: Yeah, that, that's where the boat was. SIGRIST: Yes. Do you remember the name of the boat? Do you remember your mother saying the name of the boat? MARCHIONE: No. If you name some... SIGRIST: Oh, there were hundreds and hundreds of them. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Um, all right, um, the, the, uh, crossing. You crossed the Atlantic. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Going to New York. Did you get sick? Do you remember your mother talking about this? MARCHIONE: Oh yes. They used to throw up, the people. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: My mother, there was, uh, some man. He used to come under the boat and sold lemons. SIGRIST: Yes. MARCHIONE: And, uh, for us to eat the lemons because they were good if you threw up, you know. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: And that's what we done. SIGRIST: So that's, that's what keep you from getting sick? MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: (correcting himself) Kept you from getting sick. So, um... MARCHIONE: I think we took twenty, twenty-one days or twenty-two days. Don't let me lie to you. SIGRIST: (he laughs) No, that's probably about right. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Uh, did, did, um, of course you were very young but I, I was just wondering if, um, you remember your mother talking about, did a lot of people from your neighborhood go on the same boat to America? Or were you... MARCHIONE: Well, that I don't know. SIGRIST: Right. MARCHIONE: But the boat was full of people. SIGRIST: It was very full. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty when you came into... MARCHIONE: Oh, yes. We got off in New York on 59th Street. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: With the boat and, um, and then the people would, that's, you know, we were relations to, they used to come on the, the boat... SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: And, uh, say "Don't worry, don't worry! We'll take you out." They used to pin, a you know, a paper... SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: Because they wanted to know where you live, where you don't live. SIGRIST: Right. And you remember... MARCHIONE: I remember like a dream, it is. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. Yes, yes. Uh, and, uh, so, so you went to Ellis Island then. MARCHIONE: Yes. My mother, my sister, and me. SIGRIST: I'm sorry, what was your sister's name? MARCHIONE: My sister's name was Antionette. SIGRIST: Antionette. Now who, who met you at Ellis Island? MARCHIONE: My father. SIGRIST: He came to Ellis Island. MARCHIONE: Yeah, my father and my uncle. SIGRIST: Did, um, did you remember your mother talking about Ellis Island at all. Do you... MARCHIONE: No. She only said "Thank God we're here." (they laugh) SIGRIST: It must have been a great relief after that horrible boat ride... MARCHIONE: Sure. SIGRIST: To get there. So, so your, um, your father and your uncle...is that your father's brother or your mother's brother? MARCHIONE: My mother's brother. She only had one brother. SIGRIST: I see. What was his name? MARCHIONE: His name was Vincent? SIGRIST: Vincent. And they came to Ellis Island to meet you. MARCHIONE: Yes. SIGRIST: And then where did you go? MARCHIONE: Oh, then, when, uh, we went there we got off the boat that they came to take us and we went in our house because my father had got the rooms. SIGRIST: This is on... MARCHIONE: 222 100th Street. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. And, um, he had, he had already, uh, secured an apartment for you and everything... MARCHIONE: Yes, yes. SIGRIST: Do you remember that apartment? Did you live there a long time? MARCHIONE: Oh yeah. We lived there, uh, in the front there was a chicken mart. They used to sell chickens. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: There was a chicken market.

MARCHIONE: Oh yeah. My mother used to sew for the kids, this made... SIGRIST: She made the clothes... MARCHIONE: She made the suits and everything. She made us pinafore, white, yeah. SIGRIST: I see. Your mother was a busy woman between working and sewing and.. MARCHIONE: Oh yes, yes. And we didn't have no, uh, uh, heat. SIGRIST: How was the apartment heated?

SIGRIST: I see. How did you meet your husband? MARCHIONE: I met my husband over my aunt's house. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. At a party? MARCHIONE: It, it wasn't a party. Somebody had gotten a baby and they made the, you know, like a little thing. So we went there and my husband saw me and he, he says, "I like Vita" he says, so, uh, and he came so many times before I told him "yes," because I was afraid I'd get hit and, uh, they want to know how did I meet him. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: But my husband was a very, very good man. SIGRIST: What was his name? MARCHIONE: Nick, Nicholas. SIGRIST: Nicholas. And, um, was he from Italy too or had he been born in America? MARCHIONE: No, he came here when he was seventeen years old. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: My husband. And he wouldn't and somebody showed him where he, he could board and he could go to work and they would, uh, cook for him. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: And, you know, the, uh, everybody doesn't know but they, like they cook for him a piece for themself if they made macaroni and a piece for my husband. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: Because he had bought it. And he stood there, he stood. He went to work in Long Island City... SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: For the pots and pans company. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. Is that what he was doing when you met him? MARCHIONE: No, he started go to work over there. When I met him my husband was like a contract (sic). SIGRIST: I see.

MARCHIONE: Oh yes, yes, yes. We invited him. My mother took, she felt sorry he didn't have nobody over here. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. He had no family over here. MARCHIONE: No. SIGRIST: He was by himself. MARCHIONE: Uh, he was going to go back. He told his father. But he, he told his mother "I'd like to get married and I'm going out with a nice girl." I didn't go out to a show or anything with my husband. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. Um, did, um, did your other brothers and sister, did they eventually move away from your parents or did some of... MARCHIONE: No! We stuck all together. My sister got married. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: And she went away because she got married. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. Did she go far away or did she stay in the same general area? MARCHIONE: She, I think, went in Pittsburgh. SIGRIST: Well, that's a ways from New York. MARCHIONE: Because, yeah, Pennsylvania. And, uh, but we stood always together. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. Would you always, uh, even after you were married, did you all celebrate the holidays together? MARCHIONE: Oh yes, yes. Even my aunt used to come, my mother's sister-in-law, her brothers and they used to stay weeks after the holidays (she laughs) and then they would go away. SIGRIST: Did, um, I'm just curious, once you came to America, did you get a Christmas tree for Christmas? MARCHIONE: No! No Christmas tree. SIGRIST: Of course in Italy that, you know, you wouldn't have done that, but, um, I was just wondering if once you got here, if you sort of Americanized and got a Christmas tree? MARCHIONE: No, No. SIGRIST: Especially being in a German neighborhood, because the Germans... MARCHIONE: Yes, I know, but, um, we didn't. SIGRIST: You didn't do that. Um, so anyway, you married your husband, and um, um, did you have any children? MARCHIONE: Oh, January 27th, see now, yes, when I got married I had the first baby.

MARCHIONE: Yes, we lived in New York because my father had the business I told you. SIGRIST: Right. MARCHIONE: And then he, somebody wanted to buy it, like, you know, they exchange customs and everything. And my father says, "Well we better go away from here" and we went to live near my uncle. SIGRIST: I see. MARCHIONE: My mother's brother. SIGRIST: Which was where? MARCHIONE: That was on 130...up in the Bronx, 100 and something, don't let me lie to you because I couldn't... SIGRIST: Well, uh, uh, so, uh, you, um... MARCHIONE: Oh, and my father's brother had an ice business on 100th Street. SIGRIST: Oh, they were all sort of in the ice business. MARCHIONE: Yeah, on 100th... SIGRIST: I see. Well, so you are a, you are a daughter of a, of the ice industry. (he laughs) MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Uh, I think that, um, uh, you have given us a nice view of, uh, what life was like, uh... MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Uh, in the earlier days of this century. I enjoyed talking about your father and the ice business. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Um, it's nice that you, you remember so much and... MARCHIONE: My father used to come home and eat at twelve o'clock. SIGRIST: He probably left the house very early, didn't he, if he had to make the rounds? MARCHIONE: Oh, well sure. SIGRIST: So your mother always had lunch ready for him at twelve? MARCHIONE: Oh yeah, she always, was always anybody that came over my mother's house, the table was always over there. We made our own bread. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. That's a lot of work. MARCHIONE: Big loaves. My mother used to make five or six loaves because the family was big and somebody came, you know, you offered them something. And, uh, and everybody liked my mother's bread, the olives and everything, and they used to say "Make me them", make, so my mother used to say "All right, when I go to the market I'll buy them and I'll make them for you." SIGRIST: And what a wonderful smell. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: The bread baking. MARCHIONE: Oh, the bread was, she won a medal, my mother, for the bread. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. MARCHIONE: We used to go to 107th Street to bake. There was a bakery. SIGRIST: Yeah. MARCHIONE: And you had to go early. And we used to put the bread in the carriage, covered up nice and when we would go to the bakery the man used to cut it like the slack and put it in the oven and everybody like it. SIGRIST: You put the bread, like in the baby carriage? MARCHIONE: Yeah, to go 107th Street. Who would carry it? You had to get something to put it in. SIGRIST: Uh, huh. Wow. MARCHIONE: Yeah. SIGRIST: Who would go to 107th Street now... MARCHIONE: I wish my mother and father was living today. SIGRIST: When did they die? MARCHIONE: Oh, well my father (she pauses), oh it's, that I can't, I, I remember... SIGRIST: Did they live to be very old? MARCHIONE: Well, my mother died seventy-three. And my father died, (she pauses), yeah, that I don't remember. SIGRIST: But, of course, by that time you had your own life somewhere else with your husband. MARCHIONE: Oh yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: All right, I think, um, I think we, um, we can end the interview now and I want to thank you very much for sharing your life with us... MARCHIONE: Thank you, sure. SIGRIST: And everything. And this is Paul Sigrist signing off for the National Park Service.
