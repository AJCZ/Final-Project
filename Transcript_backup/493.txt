SEAGRESS: Good morning this is Paul [Seagress] for the National Parks Service. Today is Thursday August 24th 1995. I’m in upstate New York. Is this Latham proper? Considered Latham?

FINCH: Latham.

SEAGRESS: Latham, New York with Ulasta Finch. Mrs. Finch was born in Czechoslovakia, first came to this country when she was two years old in 1913. The family then stayed in America until she was approximately how old?

FINCH: About thirteen, fourteen. 

SEAGRESS: About thirteen. Went back to Czechoslovakia for how long? 

FINCH: About a year.  

SEAGRESS: About a year, and then returned in 1924 and we think she was thirteen at that time. 

FINCH: Mm-hmm.

SEAGRESS: Can we begin by you giving me your birth date please. 

FINCH: Right. January 16th 1911. 

SEAGRESS: And where were you born in Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: In Pisek. P-I-S-E-K.

SEAGRESS: What do you know about the town that you were born in?

FINCH: Well I had some very nice recollections of it. It was a lovely town. It had…the thing I remember most vividly is the mill where people used to bring their grain in to have it ground into bread, and then the bread would be made into dough and it would go to the baker to get baked, you know. And it had a lovely—where the big wheel was—in the mill there, there was a like a little river that used to flow through it, and I remember going in a row boat with this friend—he wasn’t my cousin—but he was a boy that lived next door, and we would go and talk to the fisherman and they would give us little fish that they didn’t want, you know.  Those were some of the memories that I have of that, and I remember they used to have wonderful plum trees there and lovely flowers, and it was very quant. I remember my grandmother baking the bread and bringing it into the baker, and they would bake about five loaves of bread. And at the end of the week, when the bread got real stale, they would take bacon…the pork that they had rendered—the fat, and they would put in frying pans and put slices of bread in it to make it nice and brown and crunchy. Those were the things that I remember about that. 

SEAGRESS: I should say for the sake of the tape that we’re not far from the Albany airport, and so airplanes may be picked up. 

FINCH: You are on the airport. I have a hot dog concession as they go by. 

SEAGRESS: Oh I see. Tell me why your family decided to come to America for the first time. 

FINCH: I think my father…it was…I think it was…it was a war thing—he just didn’t want to fight for the wrong side or something. At that time or something, anyhow. I think they lived in Vienna at the time before they came. Of course all the immigrants at that time thought America was a land of gold so they all aspired to come here. And I think that was one of his reasons, and also it was fighting for the wrong war, which he didn’t want to be engaged in—I think that was one of the reasons too.

SEAGRESS: Where did your family go when they first came in 1913?

FINCH: To America?

SEAGRESS: Yes. 

FINCH: Most immigrants that came to America came into New York City at first, and they lived down between 73rd and 72nd street towards east river, which is now a very exclusive apartment house section—very wealthy—but at that time we didn’t realize it was wealthy, we just liked the water there. And they would have their skols there, and their theaters, and everything else. That was known as “Little Bohemia” then.

SEAGRESS: Their skols?

FINCH: S-K-O-L

SEAGRESS: What is that?

FINCH: See the Czechs believed…this is an old slogan of the Czechoslovakia bohemian people, which they were originally, that if you have a healthy body, you have a healthy mind. So as soon as their children are able to walk they start training them in gymnastics. Okay. Sometimes you see men up on rings that are seventy-two years old and still athletic. They have what they call a skol meet in Prague, which is the capital of Czechoslovakia. They still do it I think. Everyone in all sections of Czechoslovakia trains [Recording skips: 0:04:34] and they all perform as one unit; each one is trained, but they all perform as one unit because they’ve been indoctrinated into all this gymnastic broad jumping, the horses, the rings, the parallel bars. 

SEAGRESS: When you were a young girl in New York did you…

FINCH: [Interrupts] Oh yeah.

SEAGRESS: Can you talk about your own training in gymnastics?

FINCH: Oh yeah, oh sure. Oh yeah, I was on the rings and the parallel bar. I wasn’t very good at it. My strength was in my legs. I could run better than I could high jump, but the rings that required control, I wasn’t that good at. But I’ve been athletic because of that, all my life. I swim twenty laps in the pool even at this age. 

SEAGRESS: Were both girls and boys expected to take this kind of training?  

FINCH: Oh absolutely. You went there when you were about. You started…some start them at four years of age, you know doing tiny things, and then develop into the bigger things. 

SEAGRESS: Did your mother ever or somebody in your family ever tell you any stories associated with your birth?

FINCH: With my birth?

SEAGRESS: Yeah. Maybe something that happened or the circumstances… 

FINCH: I’m trying to think. No I guess it was the… I don’t…no she never did come to think of it. I don’t think she ever told me anything about that. You know, she had an odd background anyhow. In the European countries, you know her mother…Well are you interested in her background? 

SEAGRESS: Yes, please. Tell me. Say your mother’s name first. 

FINCH: Her name was Mary.

SEAGRESS: What was it in…

FINCH: [Interrupts] Mala. Her last name was Mala. M-A-L-A, which means small—translation is small.

SEAGRESS: Tell me what you know about your mother’s background.

FINCH: Well all I know about my mother’s background: her father died when she was very young. He was a brass-smith…see that pestle…

SEAGRESS: Oh the mortar and pestle, yeah. Uh huh.

FINCH: Yeah. He made that, years and years, when he was young. He died very young, and she was left with two children—two girls. And she had a sister who was a wealthy farmer. And they had no children so they took my mother as their daughter, and she was to inherit everything after they were gone. The only thing that happened was that my mother’s aunt died first, and the husband got involved with a sixteen-year-old farm girl, and married her. So my mother lost everything you know, and she had to go to work very early in life, so on and so forth. She’s a very hard-working woman. 

SEAGRESS: Do you now how your parents met?

FINCH: They never really talked about it. I think because they went to the same school in the same village. I think that was more or less what it was, you know. 

SEAGRESS: What was your mother’s personality like?

FINCH: Well she was as big as I was but a little heavier, and she was very, very strong-minded. Very…well…she worked; she could do most anything, you know. She’d work at anything that could create a dollar for us. So we never knew want even when it was bad, you know. She would work as a housekeeper, she would work in stores, she would work anywhere that brought her money and she could do it, you know, and so we never knew want, which was prevalent at the time when I as growing up because of the depression. And so she’s a very, very strong-minded woman. 

SEAGRESS: Is there a story that you would like to tell about maybe an experience you shared with your mother when you were a child, or maybe a story that reflects her strong mindedness?

FINCH: Well I’m just trying to think. We used to laugh together a lot together, you know. She could find humor in almost everything, you know. We could laugh together. Her sense of humor wasn’t that good…that good. I’m trying to think of what…well…she believed anything I was doing was good, and she believed in education. Where my father believed in education, but it was restricted to the European viewpoint that after you get through grammar school you go to work, you know that was the tradition in all the European countries. A girl went to work after high school…you don’t go to high school, and that was one of the bad things that I remember in my youth, you know because I wanted to go to high school. I went to school in New York. I made the rapid advancement classes, and the teachers all wanted…I’ve always been interested in education all my life and I wanted to go to school, and he didn’t feel that I should so I did it…I did it all on my own. All my life I’ve been going to school. I started college when I was almost seventy, here at SUNY, and I went right up to my master’s. In my early days I kept going and taking courses here, there, and everywhere and I finally finished my high school education the first year I was married. So that’s the way I went through my life. But I’m trying to think of something that my mother and I did. She was absolutely afraid of the water where we lived across…we moved finally to Boston and I grew up mostly in Boston. We used to live right across from the ocean, and I taught myself to swim but she was absolutely afraid of the water.

SEAGRESS: Do you know why she was afraid of the water?

FINCH: Well I think in her early days somebody pushed her in the river, when she wasn’t able to swim and she almost drowned like most people do. So she always cautioned me every time I went into the water, you know. But I became a strong swimmer as I tell you. I do twenty laps in the pool.

SEAGRESS: Tell me what your father’s name was. 

FINCH: His father couldn’t stand…See that’s another thing, my father couldn’t stand…in the European countries when you’re growing up the priest is the most central point of your life. I mean the church tells you almost who to marry, and what to marry, and how to do it, and just absolutely controls you. And my father was a very independent man. Everybody in Czechoslovakia at that time was Catholic, and so the church had a great hold on all the little villages, and everything that happened was part of the church. So he rebelled against that; he almost became an atheist when he came to America. But he was very literal; he loved to read, and he loved playing in Czechoslovakian plays, he played…I always remember him, I think mostly, studying for a part in some play. He did I think [RUR] on Broadway years and years ago, you know. It was a play, and they had a wonderful theater in the skol as I told you that was part of the you know, community thing, and they put on plays constantly— Czechoslovakian plays—so they kept the heritage of the Czechs going all the time but they put on all kinds of American plays too just translated into Czech, you know. And I remember that that was his life. He just loved it. He had a business where he…he had a store. He manufactured…or made merchun pipes and pipes of all kinds that everybody bought at that time.

SEAGRESS: This was in Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: No this was in Boston.

SEAGRESS: Oh in Boston. What kind of pipe? 

FINCH: Smoking pipes.

SEAGRESS: But you used a specific term.

FINCH: Merchun.

SEAGRESS: Can you spell that please?

FINCH: M-E-R-C-H-U-N. I think.

SEAGRESS: Are these…can you describe one of these pipes?

FINCH: Well what they were…they were beautifully designed faces in the bowl. See the bowl would be here but the face would be here okay on the pipe, and those pipes had to be smoked very carefully so that the color in them would change beautifully, you know what I mean? And so he had beads and what do they call them? Amber beads and things like that you know. 

SEAGRESS: What did he do in Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: He did the same thing. That was his trade. That’s where he learned it in Czechoslovakia, making smoking pipes, which was a big thing at that time. You know every man smoked a pipe. 

SEAGRESS: Did he smoke himself?

FINCH: Oh yeah. He smoked himself. Yeah, oh yeah. I remember he always smoked a pipe never cigarettes, just a pipe. People would have smoked pipes that they bought from him so that the color of the merchun would be the proper color. 

SEAGRESS: What would change the color on the pipe?

FINCH: Just the heat and the smoke I imagine.

SEAGRESS: And it would change it from what color to what?

FINCH: From white. It was done in white to begin with and then it would change to sort of an amber color.

SEAGRESS: Oh that’s very interesting

FINCH: Yeah it was interesting, you know. 

SEAGRESS: Was that a family trade for him?

FINCH: Well he learned it in Czechoslovakia, you know.

SEAGRESS: Did his father do that too?

FINCH: We don’t know who his father was at all. He had…both of them had broken backgrounds as it were. He was sent from an orphanage in Prague; he was sent to a town called [Mellerskol] to two people who were farmers, you know. There was money sent for him every month according to what he said, and he never found out who his parents really were. And I’ve been having one heck of a time. I’ve been trying to go and do a background check on him, and the stupid jerky people over there…I send money to them to do this and they come back and send me exactly what I’ve told them. So I’ve got no further with that background.

SEAGRESS: What name did he use as his surname? Your maiden name?

FINCH: His name was Fanta. F-A-N…like the soda.

SEAGRESS: F-A-N-T?

FINCH: -T-A. 

SEAGRESS: Where did he come up with that name?

FINCH: That was his name—that was given to him on his birth certificate. And he said he checked when he got older, he went to Prague and checked and he thought that this woman was his mother but she had just died the week before he came, you know. And it might have been something you know in the old days if there was an illegitimate child from wealthy people, they would send out into the countryside, and money was sent to take care of them but they wouldn’t have anything to do with them. So we figured that might have been it…where today it doesn’t mean anything, you know.

SEAGRESS: That’s right.

FINCH: But in those days it was a social disgrace.

SEAGRESS: Do you have any first-hand recollections of first coming to America?

FINCH: No I was only two. 

SEAGRESS: So tell me about…tell me about the Czech community in New York and life…everyday life at that time. 

FINCH: Yeah. Well it was a very nice life because they had restaurants. You could go there and eat, you know, and there was a community—you had somebody to talk to all of the time; there was a great number of them. And they had the gymnastics things there; they also had the playhouse there. So it was a pretty nice contained community, and people worked in various things. Some were in the clothing business, some were brokers, and some were...they worked in various jobs all through New York City.

SEAGRESS: How long did you stay in New York before you went to Boston?

FINCH: Let me see. I’m trying to think. I think I…well we lived there I think about maybe about eight years, and then we moved to New Jersey, and from New Jersey we went to Boston. We bought a house in New Jersey in Secaucus of all places, and then my father bought this business in Boston. So we moved to Boston. He was right next-door to the…what do they call them? [Old Howard], which was where all the comedians made their first break. We used to see all the famous old stars that were eventually movie stars. But they all started at the Old Howard to get their background—comedians and of course they all looked down on the women that went to the Old Howard, you know which was like a strip…you know.

SEAGRESS: Burlesque house?

FINCH: It was a burlesque house. That’s what it was. I’m trying to think of the word yeah that’s the burlesque house. Old Howard was here and his store was here and we could see the people coming in and out all of the time. I’ve never been in there. But I always wanted to. 

SEAGRES: [Laughs]

FINCH: But I always wanted to. I always wanted to do it, you know. 

SEAGRESS: Lets go back to New York for a little bit. 

FINCH: Sure.

SEAGRESS: Talk about the people with whom your parents associated. For instance, what language everybody spoke and the kinds of social activities.

FINCH: Well there was a break between…now on 73rd Street that was more with Slovak. 72nd Street towards 70th Street were Czechs. There was a division there. Now the Slovaks had their own skol hall on 73rd Street and they didn’t…they never liked each other too well, you know. They came together as a country because it was necessity. But personally as you know they are separated again and so they had their own life. 73rd Street was Slovak and 72nd Street was Czech. The people on an everyday basis, they would meet together and you know, some of them would make wine out of elderberries and then they would have groups come when they had to suction it off, you know, and put it in bottles and things and have parties. They were very musical and they would have a lot of musical groups together. And they would meet and play cards in some places. We never played cards because my father was always rehearsing for a play. And most of them had a very nice life, and we had a camp when I lived in New York City. We had a camp in Pelham Bay. You know where that is. Pelham Bay. Then you had to go to Pelham Bay and you had to get into a rowboat and row to this little island, which was Snake island—and we all had little tent camps there, you know. And I know my neighbors had a motorcycle and a sidecar, and they used to take me in their little sidecar and drive all the way to Pelham Bay, and that was interesting too, you know. Of course the traffic wasn’t so bad there. I learned how to roller-skate on 1st Avenue. Just imagine roller-skating there now. 

SEAGRESS: What language did your parents speak in the house? 

FINCH: Czech. 

SEAGRESS: Did they make any attempt to learn English?
FINCH: Oh yes. My mother went to school and so did my father and then as a second language they taught…it was German because Czechoslovakia at that time was under the domain of the Germans. So you had to speak German. You couldn’t speak Czech when they first came over. So they spoke very fluent German and I was a very nosy kid. I didn’t know…I wanted to know what they were saying all the time so I taught myself ear German so I could understand what they were saying that they wouldn’t say in Czech. And then one day I got so proud of myself and I said [Speaks German 0:21:33] if you know what that means? It means, “I know what you’ve said.” So they never spoke German in front of me again so that was one of the kid tricks that you know you do, and of course I can understand ear German, I can’t go into it to any degree. And when I went back to college, I thought oh I can…German, I know some German, so I’ll take German as one of my courses but I wasn’t prepared for the conjugations of the cases and so on and so forth, and I think I just passed on the fact that I could translate, you know. But it’s interesting because I travel a lot.

SEAGRESS: Tell me about your experience growing up with immigrant parents. But of course you know you’re young and you’ve gone into the school system and so you’re more Americanized I assume than they are. 

FINCH: Right.

SEAGRESS: But how did you feel about having immigrant parents and was there any tension between your ideas and their ideas?

FINCH: Oh there was, you know, because they had strict ideas of what girls can do and what girls can’t do.

SEAGRESS: Well what couldn’t girls do?

FINCH: Well at that time you couldn’t go out with a fellow unless you were chaperoned. You know what would you say…my parents were very liberal though they said I had to decide my own things in my own way because I had to do this for the rest of my life, you know, and if I did something wrong, something would happen that would take care of that for me, you know. So I’ve always been very independent because of that. But most children…I mean most of them there were trying to work into the scheme of the American society, you know. The only time I was ashamed of my parents, my husband got into business with the Chase and Sanborn people, you know.  

SEAGRESS: Coffee.

FINCH: Coffee people, and of course we used to go to their parties and things, and of course my mother couldn’t understand that, you know I mean you don’t go to all of these parties and you don’t go into the Chase and Sanborn house, you know. There was a caste system in their thinking you know what I mean? So that’s when we sort of didn’t get along too well. 

SEAGRESS: Did your parents visually look different than how you would think Americans would look at that time? In dress, in hairstyle…

FINCH: Well my mother was you know. I just looked at her as mother, you know, and she always kept up really well, you know. I mean she had very beautiful long hair, and she tried to keep up with the styles of wherever she lived. So it didn’t seem that she was incongruous in anyway, you know. 

SEAGRESS: Not that was noticeable to you?

FINCH: Not that was noticeable no—not to me it wasn’t.

SEAGRESS: Tell me why your parents decided to go back to Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: I don’t know I think my father just got tired for working for somebody at the time, you know when we went. 

SEAGRESS: Was he still making pipes at that point?

FINCH: I’m sorry?

SEAGRESS: Was he making pipes at that point?

FINCH: Yeah he was making pipes and I don’t know whether he got disgruntled with the whole system, you know. They were always going on strike or something and he got sick of that and he thought that maybe now Czechoslovakia had gotten out from under the Germans and stuff and maybe there would be some room for him to work the way he wanted to in Czechoslovakia. And so we went with another couple, you know.

SEAGRESS: How did you feel about leaving America?

FINCH: Well I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to no. Well I think my mother and father had a falling out when we got to Czechoslovakia so it seemed…I was with my father’s people part of the time and I used to have to get on a train all by myself to go across country to see my father. And finally I guess before they came to America they made up, you know, and we came back all in one group. But there was a lot of dissention when I was there in Czechoslovakia.

SEAGRESS: What do you remember about packing to leave for Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: Well let me see. I don’t think you remember that too vividly. You know when your parents said you’re going in those days you went.

SEAGRESS: Were there any other children?

FINCH: My brother.

SEAGRESS: And what was his name?

FINCH: Yeah, Joseph. 

SEAGRES: Joseph and he’s younger?

FINCH: Yeah he was five years younger.

SEAGRESS: So he was born in New York?

FINCH: No he was born in… No he wasn’t five years…I think he was two years younger than I was, yeah. No he was born in Czechoslovakia.

SEAGRESS: He was born in Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: Yeah, right. 

SEAGRESS: Do you have any first hand recollections of going to Czechoslovakia? The ship…being on the ship on the way over?

FINCH: Oh yeah, yeah we went on the George Washington.

SEAGRESS: [Interrupts] to Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: To Czechoslovakia and we came back on that and that was a fourteen-day journey, coming back it was horrible; it was the most horrible thing; I’ve never been able to go on a boat. We took it in Rotterdam I think in Holland.

SEAGRESS: Well let’s…we’ll talk about that when we get to it. Lets keep it in order here. 

FINCH: Oh ok. Is that falling off?

SEAGRESS: Let me fix your microphone here, there we go. Did um…so what do you remember about the ocean voyage over?

FINCH: Well it…you know everybody…what do you call…I remember there was lots of food, and I don’t remember that we were in any particular, big stateroom. It all seemed to be all terribly crowded. We were all together in one little stateroom, you know, which was double bunks and stuff. 

SEAGRESS: Are you talking about the other couple also that’s traveling with you or just you and your…

FINCH: No that was…they had their own stateroom; we had our own, you know, and I remember it was way down of the bottom of the ship so it couldn’t have cost very much, you know. It wasn’t steerage but it was almost that.

SEAGRESS: And then where did the ship land?

FINCH: I think it landed in the…now where did that land? Because we had to do a lot of traveling after that to get to Czechoslovakia. I think it was in Holland that it landed. 

SEAGRESS: And then how did you go from there?

FINCH: Then you had to go by train.

SEAGRES: Do you remember anything about the train ride to Czechoslovakia?  

FINCH: No I…all I remember is that it was very long and we got to Prague, and they didn’t have enough of…it was winter and it was cold and I know that I had to go to a dress shop and get some warm clothing, you know, that I remember. And I was very proud of the dresses they bought me because they were very pretty, you know, considering they were European, you know.

SEAGRESS: Do you remember them? Can you describe them for me?

FINCH: Well I think one was sort of a little check and it was green, I remember that and it was a very pretty thing and I felt very, very dressed up in it, you know. Well I had it for a long time after I was there.

SEAGRESS: What was the style of clothing at that time?

FINCH: I think…it was short; it wasn’t too long. I mean the girls didn’t wear too long dresses you know at the time. And I remember going to school in Czechoslovakia and I couldn’t understand…you know I could speak the language but not very fluently as a Czech would, living in Czechoslovakia and I couldn’t read it really so I had quite a time transferring myself into their psyche as it were. But I enjoyed a lot of the way they taught because for science and different things we’d go out into the fields, and see actuality the growing things and how it worked, and you know thought that was a good way of teaching. I enjoyed that. 

SEAGRESS: You were there about a year, correct?

FINCH: Right. 

SEAGRESS: Where did you live during that time?

FINCH: I lived in [Meliferskof].

SEAGRESS: Can you spell that please?

FINCH: Mel…M-E-L…lif…L-I-F. I can’t spell it. My spelling is horrible.

SEAGRESS: All right and with whom were you living?

FINCH: I was living with my husband’s foster parents.

SEAGRESS: Your father’s foster parents?

FINCH: Yes.

SEAGRESS: Yeah.

FINCH: And then I lived with my mother part of the time too. I was you know going back and forth between them because they had had a big fight or something there and they separated when they got to Czechoslovakia. So each one was living in a different place, and to see them both I would have to go on these trains all by myself at that time. When I think about it now you know you wouldn’t do it now.

SEAGRESS: Tell me about the house that you lived in with your father’s family.

FINCH: Well it was very interesting. There weren’t too many…it was a typical farmhouse that they have in the European countries. They had these beautiful tile stoves—which I wish I had one of—and they were made so that the old people could sit on this side of it and get the heat. Are you following me? They were made like so and then like this. 

SEAGRESS [Explains gestures] You’re taking your hand and you’re making a shelf.

FINCH: Yeah right, and in the shelf the older people would sit to get the heat of the stove.

SEAGRESS: How big were these?

FINCH: Oh they sometimes when oh…eight feet, you know they were just all made out of tiles—ceramic tiles.

SEAGRESS: And then how were they heated? What was used to heat them?

FINCH: I really don’t…I think it was [Unintelligible: 0:31:49] or something…what we could consider. I don’t think there was…maybe it was coal I don’t know. I really don’t know but I know a lot of wood was used, and now those stoves that I’m just describing, they had beautiful designs on some of them—they are museum pieces and they sell for thousands of dollars now you know.

SEAGRESS: How many rooms did the house have?

FINCH: Well I know that there was a…you went…let me see. I think there were about four rooms, you know. And you had to be in with somebody else to sleep because they didn’t have that much room and then the house opened up into the barn so that they could go out and feed the animals during the winter times, when they had…you know when it was cold and snowy out.

SEAGRESS: And did they keep animals?

FINCH: Oh yeah they kept animals right in the barn there.

SEAGRESS: What animals?

FINCH: Cackles and what was it a goat? And they had chickens and I don’t know what else they had.

SEAGRESS: Did you ever have to interact with the animals in any way?

FINCH: Well I was taught how to milk a cow, and I don’t know how to do it anymore but I was taught how to do it at the time but I wouldn’t do it again. 

SEAGRESS: And your father’s relatives who are they exactly?

FINCH: Well they are the people. They’re the foster parents. 

SEAGRESS: The foster parents.

FINCH: Yeah they are the foster parents.

SEAGRESS: Talk to me a little about them and what they were like as people. 

FINCH: Well all I can remember is that the mother was a typical European, old, old, well she wasn’t old at the time, but she looked very old to me with a babushka always kept on her head and she was small and bent over when I met her, you know. But the man, his foster father was an old, tall man, and I know that there was sort of a foster brother too. They weren’t very pleasant people, you know, and I don’t remember too much of them because I didn’t like them very much.

SEAGRESS: What did they feed you while you were there?

FINCH: Well the typical European…see the typical European food for Czechs were roast pork, sauerkraut, and dumplings of various kinds, you know, and that’s your typical deal. Otherwise they would…they never lost any part of an animal, you ate everything, they had the stomach and they had the…well every part of the animal was eaten or something and you learned to eat it.

SEAGRESS: And how would they prepare the entrails? What kind of a dish would they make?

FINCH: Well surprisingly like they make kidney stew, which is used in England the same way, and it was very tasty until I learned what it was and then I couldn’t eat it anymore. The stomach was kind of a white sort of thing, and they made a cream sauce. They had all kinds of sauces like the French made more sauces than they do food. The sauces were to cover the imperfections of the food you were eating, you know. They thought up more sauces. They had sauces for string beans—they had sauces for everything and so the food was very tasty until you grew up and you knew what part of the animal it was and then you wouldn’t eat it.

SEAGERSS: And where was the food prepared? In what kind of a…?

FINCH: Well they had a place in the kitchen, they had you know. They brought in…I don’t think there was running water. I think you had to go out to the well to get the water. And they would have a sink and a place to prepare the food, you know, and then you had tables to sit at you know. 

SEAGRESS: But what…I guess what I’m getting is what… like was there a fireplace that they used or did they have a cook stove?

FINCH: Well they had the tile stove. That was the thing that they cooked on too. See a lot of them would have this place over here for the old people and then over here it would be where they could cook.  

SEAGRESS: Sure. So that’s on the opposite side?

FINCH: On the opposite side yeah.

SEAGRESS: Uh huh.

FINCH: And they used that for cooking and they used it for heating and for many, many things you know. 

SEAGRESS: Is there a piece of furniture in that house that sticks out in your mind?

FINCH: Not really. The stove is the one that always attracted me, you know. But it was mostly rustic furniture made out of…you know they made their own furniture. The sofa would be homemade, and the chairs would be homemade out of wood homemade, most of it was homemade stuff. I don’t remember any particular thing as I said I wasn’t very happy there so I didn’t…it hasn’t stayed in my mind too much.

SEAGRESS: Yeah how did you feel having come from the United States and as somewhat more technologically advanced lifestyle to having to be forced really to be in a situation…

FINCH: [Interrupts] Right. Well I wasn’t very happy about it but as a child during that particular time you didn’t argue with your parents. You went and did what they said because they were very commanding, you know. You were there’s to do as they wanted with. That’s the way the kids were brought up in those days. I mean now the kids rebel. I mean they have laws that govern the kids. But in the early days of our culture, you more or less obeyed your parents and whatever they wanted to do as much as you hated to do it.

SEAGERSS: You just accepted your fate?

FINCH: Yeah you accepted it. And I was just hoping that we’d go back to America, you know and I was delighted when they did. And I enjoyed… it’s a beautiful country and because I liked the outdoors I would love the woods and I would walk in them and I loved the mountains, and I loved the scenery. It was beautiful, you know, and then a friend of mine had a son and we used to go and do crazy things together, you know… steal fruit and things like that. I remember that you know. I remember the plums. 

SEAGRESS: Yeah the plums?

FINCH: We had plum trees and I remember we swiped some of the plums one night…maybe because we stole them they tasted that much sweeter. But they were the most delicious things I ever tasted in my life. I went back to Czechoslovakia just two years ago, which was a great disappointment, and I tried to emulate those plums but they were nowhere to be found.  

SEAGRESS: [Laughs] Tell me about what your religious life was like while you were living with you foster grandparents? 

FINCH: Well it seems that they weren’t too religious either, neither was my father or my mother, you know. They were born Catholics and I was christened a Catholic but we never professed it. I mean my father didn’t believe in going to church or anything but I always wanted religion so I as an individual would go to church. But it wasn’t anything that I was forced to go to with my parents. Yes I do remember a really lovely thing because I liked going to church. They had these monasteries there and I would sneak away towards evening when the monks would be doing their prayers, you know, and the high mass was done with beautiful singing and their voices were just beautiful to hear in the evening, you know, and I used to enjoy that a lot.

SEAGRESS: What about celebrating religious holidays at all—do you remember celebrating a holiday?

FINCH: Well they would celebrate Christmas of course, you know and Saints’ days. But I think his parents felt all that was nonsense, you know. You shouldn’t stop working just because it was a holiday or something like that. But the main ones like Easter and Christmas, which everybody celebrated in the village, you know, they would go along with that. And the big meal at Christmas time was goose. You had roast goose, and the same things sauerkraut and dumplings. 

SEAGRESS: Was the goose one of theirs?

FINCH: Yeah oh sure. Absolutely.

SEAGRESS: And then how was it killed?

FINCH: Well they just run its neck. That’s the typical way they did it, and then they would stuff the goose with all kinds of goodies, you know, and things that they particularly liked you know. 

SEAGRESS: What would they do with the…how would they get the feathers off the goose?

FINCH: You dip them in hot water and then you pluck them. Did you ever do it?

SEAGRESS: No. [Laughs] Then was there some use for the feathers after that?

FINCH: Oh sure. You took those feathers and you kept them all--chicken feathers, goose feathers mostly were very valuable, especially the little ones because you made down pillows out of them or you sold the down.

SEAGRESS: And the down pillows did you use those in the house in Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: Oh yeah. I still do. Yeah everybody had down pillows—and you slept under a great big down…well I can’t say it was a puff…but it was made like a great big bag and it was filled with down feathers, which were very light on your body but very warm because it was very cold there. 

SEAGRESS: Who decided to return to America?

FINCH: I think my father and his friend who was also there didn’t like what he saw, you know, so they both decided to come back.

SEAGRESS: What do you remember about getting ready to leave Czechoslovakia? Packing and that sort of thing? 

FINCH: Well the packing wasn’t too bad because we didn’t bring that much stuff, you know. So we just packed up what we had and said goodbye to a lot of nice people that we had met, and I hated to lose my companion that I had had for a year you know and his family were very kind to me. And we started off… I don’t know…we took the train to England, I remember crossing the channel, you know and it was very rocky I mean the boat you know. The channel is very rough over in England. I remember crossing that and we went over to Rotterdam to get the boat back. And the typical thing is when Europeans leave Czechoslovakia or anywhere, the thing was you would buy a great big salami, they weren’t going to feed you or anywhere so you had to come prepared with your own food—that’s what they all thought. So they had these great big long salamis, hard salami, and they’d bring a big loaf of bread with them. I remember that very vividly because I used to sneak pieces of that, you know. You brought that with you just to sustain you in case they didn’t feed you. Czechs like to eat, that’s one thing they have you know all throughout Czechoslovakia and they would make the most delicious pastries you ever ate in your life, you know, in Czechoslovakia—absolutely delicious.

SEAGRESS: What was the name of the ship that you took back to the United States?

FINCH: It was the same one. George Washington. 

SEAGRESS: George Washington, and where did you pick the ship up?

FINCH: In Rotterdam. 

SEAGRESS: In Rotterdam, and what…you alluded to it a little bit earlier you said the trip was…

FINCH: [Interrupts] Oh it was the most horrible trip I ever had in my life. It was…we started out in January and that is the worst time to be on the Atlantic Ocean because the storms are all in there and the waves were so bad they would come right over the top of the boat, and we had to be tied in. We had a rope around us all the time we were on the boat so that we wouldn’t fall overboard, and there were no stabilizers on boats in those days so it was always going one way or the other. You sat down to eat at a table and nine times out of ten you never finished your meal because it was in your lap. It was the roughest thing I ever went through in my life and when I saw that Statue of Liberty I could have gone up to kiss it. It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life. But I’m very patriotic. I love the flag. I hate to see them desecrate a flag and I’m very angry when people don’t stand up and tip their hats when the flag comes by. So when I saw that Statue of Liberty I just thought it was the most wonderful thing I ever saw in my life.

SEAGRESS: What other things stick out in your mind about that crossing back? For instance can you describe for me where you stayed on that trip in the ship?

FINCH: Well we were down the same idea you know…they came back and they didn’t have that much money. You know the money was gone after a year. So we were way down in the hole; you had to go way upstairs to go to eat or anything you had to go way down. I always remember I hated it, and I was very much afraid because I don’t like to be confined anywhere, and being down in the hole in the little tiny cabin was horrible. We had double-deckers you know on both sides of the room and we slept there, and at night -time when the boat was pitching you’d fall out of the darn thing if you didn’t hold on; it was that bad. And the food was not that good either because you didn’t get that much of it and most of the time you were feeding the fish anyhow. You were throwing up because the voyage was so bad.  

SEAGRESS: Were there any safety drills on the ship that you can recall?

FINCH: Not a one. Not a one.

SEAGRESS: Do you know how long the ship took?

FINCH: How long it took to come over?

SEAGRESS: To get to New York?

FINCH: Two weeks.

SEAGRESS: Two weeks, and you said you saw the Statue of Liberty and that made you happy.

FINCH: Oh absolutely.

SEAGRESS: Then what happened? Once you came into the harbor…

FINCH: Well let’s see we went back to 72nd street and we lived in an apartment. 

SEAGRESS: No before that. I mean talk to me about… 

FINCH: [Interrupts] Well I met this girl who was my age, you know, and she came from Russia or somewhere. I don’t remember what country. Budapest? No it wasn’t Budapest. Well anyhow one of the European countries and we had a lot of fun together. But she had lice and I didn’t know it, and I had long hair all the way down to my buttocks, you know way down, and I contracted her lice. So when I came out they examine you know, before you leave the boat, and they examined me and I had the lice. Well I couldn’t dock; I couldn’t go into America until I was de-loused. That’s how I happened to get on the island, and that’s where they did it.

SEAGRESS: Well how did they de-louse you?

FINCH: Well I remember they explained it to me. But I remember they poured kerosene or something in there you know, and I had to keep my eyes closed so that it wouldn’t you know…and then I remember them putting me under a shower, you know, and that’s when I came into that night. I heard all this noise, and the people all grouped together and crying and stuff, you know, and the smell was terrible. And then I asked about the places outside; they said well you know a lot of people will have to be sent back to whatever country they came from because they’re sick. You know things like that. 

SEAGRESS: How did you feel about going through this experience?

FINCH: Well it was very degrading, you know. I felt terrible that I had to go through this. I was a very proud kid and to have lice to me was horrible, you know, and to be having to go through this to get into America again was terrible to me too, you know, but it was something I had to do to get into America again. It was the only thing I could do.

SEAGRESS: Were your parents brought out to Ellis Island with you?

FINCH: They must have been. I don’t seem to remember them being there but they must have been because you know I went with them afterwards so they must have been there, but I don’t know in what capacity. It didn’t take too long for me to be there. They did a thorough job, you know, of whatever they did, and I think I was only there over night.

SEAGRESS: Oh you stayed over night at Ellis Island?

FINCH: I think I was there over night. I don’t remember where I slept though or maybe I didn’t stay over night. It’s so long ago, you know, it’s hard to remember. But I know that when we left there we went back to New York City again. But I remember all those…that’s why I wrote that on that letter is I remembered you know they were all in like lines you know waiting to.

SEAGRESS: The immigrants were.

FINCH: Yeah, the immigrants. Waiting to get their passports or whatever to allow them to get back into America. They were being examined and their names were being yelled at, and people were crying, and babies were crying, and messing. And there was such a smell and everything. The smell is what got me, you know. I remember that.

SEAGRESS: Do you remember having to be examined in any way once you were there?

FINCH: I think they did examine me, you know, because they examined everybody, you know. If they had tuberculosis or anything they were all sent back. I think I was examined. 

SEAGRESS: And somehow your brother escaped having lice?

FINCH: He didn’t have to do anything, no. He was all right you know. He was with my parents all the time. I don’t remember him being with me at all.

SEAGRESS: Were your parents American citizens from having been in America all that time?

FINCH: Yeah my father was a citizen then, yeah. That’s why he was able to come in you know. He didn’t have to come in through the lines I know that. You know…I remember you know finally getting to them and we just took off on the bus. Or was it? Yeah. It must have been the bus, no because Ellis Island…no we had to go on a boat first and get into New York City, and then you know. Evidently we had some friends there or somebody that we stayed with the first couple of weeks that we were, you know, in America again and I don’t remember who the heck they were. But I know we didn’t have a house or anything, you know. We just had to stay with them.

SEAGRESS: Did you stay in the same neighborhood that you lived?

FINCH: Yeah, yeah.

SEAGRESS: And again that Czech neighborhood.

FINCH: Yeah, yeah the same thing. Every Czech goes to the same neighborhood.

SEAGRESS: How did your parents feel about being back in America at this point?

FINCH: They were happy to be back there. I don’t think their well…I guess because they had you know…they separated when they got there, they weren’t too happy about the whole situation. But my parents…my mother wasn’t as intellectual as my father was. Do you I know what I mean? He really was a very well read man for his day and age, and my mother… and he was very handsome and women liked him and he had a lot of problems with my mother because of that. And so they were always getting together and separating and I’d bring them together again and this went on in the United States too. So I was all before my time if you know what I mean. Evidently they got jobs as soon as they came back because you know.

SEAGRESS: Do you remember what those jobs were?

FINCH: I don’t remember. I think my mother at one time she worked at a bakery selling some baked goods or something to friends of hers when she first came back, and my father got a job in a factory doing whatever he did.

SEAGRESS: So they stayed in New York then?

FINCH: Yeah they stayed in New York for a while, yeah.

SEAGRESS: Did your mother ever relate to you her experiences that she had had while she was in Czechoslovakia, and how she felt about…

FINCH: [Interrupts] Not really, and that’s a funny…I look back and I think no she really didn’t talk too much about it except she talked about not having a mother, you know, because she didn’t.

SEAGRESS: Well where did she live? I know she wasn’t living where you were but with whom did she live when she was in Czechoslovakia?

FINCH: Well she lived with some friends, you know, and then I went to live with her when I was in Czechoslovakia you know. I left…I didn’t like living where my father was so I went to live with her and she was with some friends and it was a much more pleasant atmosphere you know. But I don’t remember her telling…it’s the funniest thing because when you’re young you don’t think about the past. You don’t think you want to know, and all we knew about them was that neither one of them had a background of parents. So there wasn’t really too much…she used to tell us a story about this uncle who married this girl who was about sixteen years old, you know, and then she was thrown out on her own because she took over everything you know, and so she was very unhappy about that.

SEAGRESS: Then am I right in assuming your mother didn’t talk much about what she was feeling?

FINCH: No. No she didn’t, you know. No.

SEAGRESS: Did you have other relatives in the United States?

FINCH: No I had…see neither one of them had any relatives because they didn’t have any family. So we knew nobody as far as relatives, which I missed terribly because it seemed every one of my friends had so many relatives and I had nobody.

SEAGRESS: When you first got back to the United States how did your time in Czechoslovakia change you or alter the way you looked at things?

FINCH: Well I knew that you know I went back to school then. I was P.S. 86 in New York City and every time I walked from there—we were on 72nd Street—and I walked all the way down to 86th Street to go to school, and I’d see that American flag flying up there, and my heart would just flutter. Something or other I was very patriotic. That thing it just affected me to see that flag flying there. I was so happy to be back in America, you know, because I was getting…there wasn’t anything really for me in Czechoslovakia, and it seemed to me I was riding from one parent to the other and there were always disturbances you know, so it wasn’t a very happy time.

SEAGRESS: Did being in Czechoslovakia and having those kinds of experiences affect the way your desire to speak Czech in America at all?

FINCH: No that never bothered me. But see what I would do all my life when I lived in New York, every Sunday I would head up to 5th Avenue I was very curious. I always wanted to find out about everything I would go into the museum of art there and I would go to the lectures they had there and I would go through the museum. So I gave myself a veneer of education just by myself. You know what I mean? And my parents let me go any way I wanted to go, you know.

SEAGRESS: Your father obviously could write and everything?

FINCH: Oh sure.

SEAGRESS: Did your mother read and write?

FINCH: Oh sure. They could right Czech and German.

SEAGRESS: Of course.

FINCH: Their English was not of the best but they could get along you know.

SEAGRESS: Did you find that when you went back to school when you got here that you were you treated differently? I mean did people consider you American or Czech?

FINCH: Oh no they considered me American, yeah I mean...

SEAGRESS: Your peers I mean.

FINCH: Yeah, you know I got along with everybody, and that’s where in this P.S. I was in the eighth grade then and I made the rapid advancement class, you know because of an intelligence test and I couldn’t finish it because I had blood poisoning and they had to operate on me on the kitchen table. In those days children wore black stockings okay and I was a very tall girl. I was as tall as I am now, and in those days you weren’t tall and my feet were just as big and they only made a certain size shoe for women, and I had to squeeze my little big feet into this little shoe and so I was constantly getting blisters, and the dye was not permanent in those days in the black stocking and it got into my blisters and so it created … my whole leg was just stiff, and they couldn’t even get me to the hospital so they operated on the kitchen table.

SEAGRESS: What do you remember about that experience?

FINCH: It was horrible. I remember the doctor putting the thing on my…my mother was putting all these [Unintelligible 0:57:37] on it you know like the old timers used to do, you know, and of course I had a great big lump up here. 

SEAGRESS: Oh on your thigh.

FINCH: No it was in my groin.

SEAGRESS: Your groin, oh.

FINCH: Yeah and it wasn’t getting any better and the foot was just getting harder you know; it was stiffening up and so she finally called the doctor. They didn’t usually call doctors, you know, they could take care of all these little problems themselves. 

SEAGRESS: Do you know what the [Unintelligible: 0:58:04] was made out of?

FINCH: Well usually what they used was raw potatoes because potatoes draw, okay.

SEAGRESS: Draw meaning absorb? 

FINCH: Yeah, well it draws the poison out, you know and different things that would draw the poison out, but it was too far gone by that time. So the neighbors told us you have to get a doctor and when the doctor came, he took one look at me and said if we don’t operate right now she will loose her leg and she’ll die, and periphrenitis will set in, and she’s almost got in now. So they operated on the kitchen table. It was very primitive. I’ve gone through quite a few of those crazy things like that I had hydrophone injections when nobody was getting them either. But I guess I lived but lost the fact that I couldn’t go to school and finish my two years or more, you know so I lost out on that.

SEAGRESS: And education has always been so important to you.

FINCH: Very important to me. Always. I always wanted to learn…you know anything I was… in my thinking and my reading, you know.

SEAGRESS: If you had the opportunity to give some advice to a young person about how to lead their life successfully based on the things that you did and you wanted, what would you tell someone?

FINCH: It’s a difficult thing to tell somebody how to live their life because each one is an individual and absorbs things that happen to them in different ways so its very hard for a person to tell them, you know, the only thing I would say would be to keep an open mind and learn. Learn everything because there’s nothing in this world…if its done by somebody you can do it too. That’s the way I always look at things. If I look at something and I have to…it looks very difficult to do, I’ll say well somebody did it, I’ll have to learn how to do it. And I think if you keep your mind open and absorb everything comes along and try to keep a good outlook on it, I think that’s all you can do and try to be happy about it.

SEAGRESS: Well thank you. Mrs. Finch we’re going to end now. I want to thank you very much.

FINCH: You’re welcome.

SEAGRESS: This is Paul Seagress signing off with Ulasta Finch. This is August 24th 1995 in Latham, New York. Thanks.

FINCH: Right.
