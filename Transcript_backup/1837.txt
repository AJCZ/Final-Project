SIGRIST: You didn’t stay there very long? WILLIAMS: Because they had a Welsh church in Plainfield. SIGRIST: Did you go, did your brothers bring you to Plainfield? WILLIAMS: Hm-hmm. SIGRIST: Oh. So you didn’t even, they just picked you up in Utica. WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: You didn’t stay there. WILLIAMS: No, no. SIGRIST: I see. Tell me about what they were doing in Plainfield. What, why were your brothers in Plainfield? WILLIAMS: Oh, they were all farming or working there on the farms. And my sister was starting here on the main road, and they were on a big farm. SIGRIST: Had she married? WILLIAMS: Yes. She had, was it three, three kids when I come here? SIGRIST: Three kids? WILLIAMS: Margaret and John Dee... van Nort: (unintelligible) SIGRIST: You can talk, you don’t have to...(he laughs) WILLIAMS: Margaret and John Dee and you. van Nort: Right. WILLIAMS: Three. She had three. SIGRIST: Three kids. Did she marry an American? WILLIAMS: No, a Welshman. SIGRIST: So, did she come over here when she was married, or did she meet this gentleman from Wales when she was here? WILLIAMS: She was, she come here, and she come afterwards. SIGRIST: I see. WILLIAMS: Because she was going with him in Wales. SIGRIST: But they weren’t married in Wales. WILLIAMS: No. SIGRIST: I see. So he came first, and then he sent for her later and they married here. Well, tell me, what did you do when you got here. After you got better, your seasickness was gone, did you get a job? WILLIAMS: Yes. I went to keep house for my brothers on the farm. SIGRIST: Did they all live together? WILLIAMS: The two of them did. SIGRIST: Which two? WILLIAMS: Jack and Bob. SIGRIST: And they’re the brothers that you went to. WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: What kinds of things did you have to do? WILLIAMS: Do all the housework. Didn’t know much about that, you know, from different (unintelligible). SIGRIST: How did, how did you cope to this situation? I mean, this is a big responsibility. Was this difficult for you? WILLIAMS: Yes. Yeah, well, we pick up. SIGRIST: Tell me how you learned to speak English well? WILLIAMS: Oh, just pick it up from others, you know. They, yeah. SIGRIST: Did you, did, did anyone try to help you learn English? Did anyone try to... WILLIAMS: No. No. SIGRIST: Did your brothers speak English? WILLIAMS: No. We were all Welsh up there. SIGRIST: And this was a Welsh community? WILLIAMS: Yes, it was then. SIGRIST: So everyone spoke Welsh. WILLIAMS: Yes. Church. SIGRIST: Was there, there was a Welsh church up there? WILLIAMS: Yes, there was. SIGRIST: Can you tell me a little bit about the church? WILLIAMS: I don’t know. It’s just a regular Welsh church. It was just like others, you know. We used to go every morning, every Sunday morning. SIGRIST: Did you go three times a day, like you had in Wales? WILLIAMS: Not, not like in Wales, no. No. SIGRIST: Were you homesick for Wales when you came here? WILLIAMS: I was. Yes. But I got over it. SIGRIST: Were you writing back and forth to your parents? WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. Yeah. SIGRIST: What was the hardest thing about being in this country? WILLIAMS: Oh, I don’t know. Being so far from Wales, I guess. SIGRIST: What, actually your life of course, I mean, you went sort of from one kind of farming area, sort of, to another. I mean, it wasn’t that different, was it, being here than it had been in Wales? WILLIAMS: Oh, the work is different there than it is over here. A lot different. SIGRIST: Well, what is different about it? WILLIAMS: Well, you didn’t see the women on their knees mopping the floors over here. That’s how we had to do in Wales. Wash the floors on their knees. But here you have the mops. SIGRIST: So did you stay in Plainfield for a long time? WILLIAMS: Yes. Forty-three years. SIGRIST: That’s a long time. WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did you meet your husband in Plainfield? WILLIAMS: No. I met him in Wales. SIGRIST: Oh, well tell me... WILLIAMS: And followed us, followed me. SIGRIST: So you knew him before you left Wales. WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: Oh. All right. Well, what was your husband’s name? WILLIAMS: Bob Williams. SIGRIST: And tell me how you met your husband in Wales. WILLIAMS: Well, I used to go to school with him. He was a neighbor. Yeah. SIGRIST: And he just asked you out one day, or? WILLIAMS: Yeah. Well, I used to go out to school with him every day, you know. SIGRIST: So you’d known him a long time. WILLIAMS: Yes. SIGRIST: So you came in 1920. When did he come? WILLIAMS: He came three, I came in September and he came in December right after me. SIGRIST: And then did you get married here? WILLIAMS: Yes. 1923. SIGRIST: And did you get married in the Welsh church. WILLIAMS: No, in the parsonage. SIGRIST: What was it, describe what it was like to get married in Plainfield in 1923. WILLIAMS: Well, I was, my, I didn’t went (???) in the parsonage church there. Yeah. Just the four of us. SIGRIST: The, you, your husband... WILLIAMS: The bridesmaid and the best man. SIGRIST: Who was your bridesmaid? WILLIAMS: The minister’s wife. The minister stood up for us. SIGRIST: Who, do you remember the name of the minister? WILLIAMS: Daniel Hughes. SIGRIST: H-U-G-H-E-S. WILLIAMS: Yeah. And his wife. SIGRIST: And then did you have a honeymoon? WILLIAMS: No. SIGRIST: Back to the farm? WILLIAMS: Get to work. (they laugh) SIGRIST: And can you name your children for me? WILLIAMS: Oh, Bobby, Robert John. And Owen Richard. SIGRIST: Who was the last one? WILLIAMS: Owen. SIGRIST: Owen. WILLIAMS: Richard. SIGRIST: Owen Richard. So Robert John is one, and Owen Richard is another. You had two boys. WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: I see. Let me just ask you a couple final questions. One is... WILLIAMS: Oh, good. SIGRIST: Yeah, we’re almost done. (he laughs) I’ve got to drive back to Albany in the blizzard, so. (she laughs) Let me ask you, what, what aspect of you, what part of you is truly Welsh? What part of Wales have you kept in you your whole life? WILLIAMS: Oh, all of Wales. SIGRIST: But is there something that you do, or something that you enjoy that, that really hearkens back to your Welsh ancestry? WILLIAMS: Oh, I don’t know. Just to be with them, and... SIGRIST: You like to be around Welsh people. WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: How do you think your life would have been different if you’d stayed in Wales? WILLIAMS: Oh, it’d be a lot different. The work would be a lot different, than over here. SIGRIST: It’d be a harder life for you. WILLIAMS: Yes. They are fifty years behind over there with the work. SIGRIST: Have you ever gone back to visit? WILLIAMS: Yes. Twice. SIGRIST: When was the first time? WILLIAMS: Oh, Evelyn, you were with me. (she laughs) Do you remember the first time? SIGRIST: Evelyn, when was the first time you went back to Wales? (they laugh) WILLIAMS: Get your brains to work. (she laughs) van Nort: It must have been in ‘53. WILLIAMS: ‘63? van Nort: ‘53. SIGRIST: ‘53? WILLIAMS: ‘53. SIGRIST: 1953. van Nort: And then I think we went again in ‘56, didn’t we? WILLIAMS: Yeah. SIGRIST: What, when you went back the first time, what, what struck you as being different? What stood out in your mind as being different than America? WILLIAMS: Oh, gosh, I don’t know. What was it, Evelyn? SIGRIST: It has to be what you were thinking. I mean, what struck you as being very different? WILLIAMS: Gosh, everything was different. SIGRIST: You hadn’t been back in thirty-three years. What had changed? WILLIAMS: Oh, I don’t know. Everything. The places looked different, and the people looked different, you know. You wouldn’t know them, and, yeah. SIGRIST: Was it different than how you’d remembered it? WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. A lot different. SIGRIST: Are you glad that you came to this country? WILLIAMS: Yes. I am. SIGRIST: Because they have mops, I guess. (they laugh) WILLIAMS: Well, they have mops here. SIGRIST: Well, Mrs. Williams, I want to thank you very much for... WILLIAMS: Well, you’re welcome. SIGRIST: ...letting me trudge through the snow and come over here and interview you. This is Paul Sigrist signing off with Margaret Williams in Bridgewater, New York, on January 31st, 1993.
