When the food was coming in I was leaving, I was going up to, I couldn't stand it, so I had-- Sometimes I used to pass by the bar and they had some kind of fish on the table. The first day I took some money, I handed the man to get the food on the spot. So the next day I went there, there was nobody there, and I took it, and I used to run all the way up to the top, to sit there for a couple of hours, and then go down. DALLETT: So you ate fish and never ate that, that macaroni again. CHLETSOS: I never go back at that table again. DALLETT: So did you find that you had plenty to eat? CHLETSOS: Oh, yeah. (He laughs.) DALLETT: And how about sleeping accommodations? Do you remember, were there bunks or, where did you sleep on the boat? CHLETSOS: Over the, all the way down, one bed on another on the top.

Except in, in Belgium, before we went to the boat. There was a doctor, he was looking in your eyes, and he find that something wrong with my eyes. It was like a, I don't know, was a-- So he took me back. So he, he start with the next man. But my oldest cousin, he was the first one, he was passing by, he was waiting for me.
