ANNA: Oh, at that job . . . EDWARD: When did you get the job in Douglaston? ANNA: Oh, in Douglaston, then I come there, I come him, I come home. In Douglaston I get the fine home. I was alone to take care of all that big house. And I did. EDWARD: Who were the people there? ANNA: Oh, yes, yes. But that mister, he was, you know, the legality, uh . . . EDWARD: A lawyer? ANNA: Yeah, a lawyer. And then that lady, she went out of the house every day, to the city! She went to the city. So I was alone. I had to take care of that house alone. So motheraybe she call, they called home and asked if I have enough things, (?). Have you seen me (?). I am so (?) in the telephone. EDWARD: You liked it there? ANNA: There I like it.

( she laughs ) NASH: You say that I . . . ANNA: (?). EDWARD: It probably was that . . . ANNA: I want to come over. EDWARD: It's easier to come over by anyone who has relatives in the United States at that time. ANNA: He want to come over. EDWARD: See, a long time ago. They changed immigration rules, quite a lot since then. NASH: So you decided to go back for a visit to Sweden. ANNA: Yes, I was visit home. I was (?). EDWARD: But you became a citizen while you were in Douglaston. ANNA: Oh, yes. I took everything here, I was working here. All my papers was clear. Everything I had (?).

EDWARD: Yes. ANNA: They weren't any trouble. EDWARD: Well, do you remember going to the court? ANNA: Nay. Oh, the last one, the man, the last one. When they say that this is the, what they call the man, this is finished now. EDWARD: Final appears. ANNA: Yes, that is him. Then we had to . . . EDWARD: Did you have to do anything? Did you have to read anything? ANNA: We had, to, uh, no. We have to (?). I had my papers finished, you know from the bottom to the top. I had nothing to say. EDWARD: Did you have to read? ANNA: Huh? EDWARD: Did you have to read any English or anything? ANNA: Oh, I did. ( she laughs ) Then I come to the last one, that I should read English. So I'm starting to read loud and clear. "Oh, no," he says, "go. Go away. You can read." He don't want me to read more, see. NASH: Because of how well you read. ANNA: Oh, that's the way. I was so good. ( she laughs ) EDWARD: Did you know any English when you came to this country? ANNA: What? EDWARD: Did you know any English when you came to this country? ANNA: Nay, nay, nay, nay. I had been alone. EDWARD'S WIFE: That had been five years . . . EDWARD: Did you learn English by yourself? ANNA: Yes, yes. I do everything, I am that kind of person that I do everything myself. NASH: How, were there any special ways that you taught yourself English? ANNA: Oh, everything myself. I'm starting to read the papers, the daily papers. I took them with me up on my room. When I was up there and I read all the (?) and I read, I read, I read. NASH: Did you have a dictionary? You had a dictionary. ANNA: I learned it, I learned it. NASH: No dictionary. ANNA: No. When I was alone. I want to do everything myself. I am what they call it, (?). ( Swedish ) EDWARD: Did you learn to speak English? What did you ask . . . ANNA: (Swedish) EDWARD: Do you mean to say self-made? ANNA: Yes, yes. I come to school, I ask teacher about him, from the school. Then you go over here? So I ask that teacher. I ask the teacher about my boy. And he has a very good word about my boy. So then I say (Swedish). EDWARD: Yes. ANNA: Yes, (Swedish). Oh, that was (?) from me. EDWARD: The teacher said that her little boy was very independent. ( Mrs. Karlsson laughs ) That it was inherited from . . . ( they laugh ) NASH: His mother. ANNA: Yah. Oh, (?) ( she laughs ) NASH: Okay. Let's go back now to, you went to Sweden, and you told your son about how it was in the United States. And what do you remember your mother, what do you remember of that visit when your mother came back? EDWARD: Well, I had just finished school in that particular town where my grandmother lived, where I grew up. And, of course, my mother came visiting, and that was, that was in 1931. And it was, of course, very interesting to listen to all her tales about the United States and about her life, and about what happened to her in New York, and on Long Island and other places. NASH: What stories do you remember in particular? EDWARD: Well, this one where she had to leave, run away with her clothes, of course, is very dramatic, ( he laughs ) in the winter, and how she had to do these things. But the thing that she liked to talk most about was how pleasant she thought it was in Douglaston where she had this apparently quite affluent family to take care of, and she had a chance to be out on the large grass lawn they had, sunbathing and going to the beach in Douglaston where she, as a member of that household, was able to have a pass in those days, and this she found very pleasant, she liked to swim very much. And we, the story there was that she liked it very much in . . . END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO NASH: So she worked in a household, about her experience with the other maids and the other servants in the household. Apparently there's a lot of conflicts between people who were employed in the household. EDWARD: Now you can tell about that story when you were in Washington and had, working on starting that new household there. Do you remember that? ANNA: Oh, no. I should be cook there. EDWARD: Yes. What did you do? ANNA: Oh, aye, aye, the were lots of people. There were thirty people in the help to cook for. I couldn't stay there! I wasn't . . . EDWARD: Well, how did you do? You went out everywhere and got the pots and the pans and all this . . . ANNA: Oh, no, no, no, no. I (Swedish). EDWARD: Yes. But how did you start? ANNA: (Swedish) I went into the lady and say I want to live. EDWARD: No. But before you had to . . . ANNA: No, I cook, I cook. EDWARD: You had to go around town getting all the things started. ANNA: Oh, yes. I have to cook. First, when I come, I have to go with the chauffeur taking all the, uh, cooking, all the cooking . . . EDWARD: Utensils. ANNA: For the cooking. I had to do that. And then I . . . ( she laughs ) EDWARD: You had to get all the food? ANNA: Nay, not the food. The (?). (Swedish) EDWARD: You have to speak English, you know. ANNA: You see? I had to . . . EDWARD: Tell about how many meals you had to make each day. You had to make many meals each day? ANNA: Yes, I think about seven meals. NASH: Seven. ANNA: Oh, my. NASH: Did the same people eat all seven meals? ANNA: Yeah, nay, the (?). ( Ms. Nash laughs ) EDWARD: Who ate all the meals? ANNA: Oh, that was for the help, for the people that was there at night. There would be another food, another food. EDWARD: Did anyone help you to do these things? ANNA: (?) EDWARD: Who helped you? ANNA: ( off-mike voices heard in the background ) Oh, well, you have to work. You have to work, that's all. That's what I had to do. I went, twelve o'clock at night I went up to the wife. They had five stairs up there I should (?), just come up, and then I had to go down again for to be finished. EDWARD: When did you start in the morning? ANNA: Ay, yay yay. I had to start at five or six o'clock. Oh, there I work and I work. I had work, I tell you, in my life. EDWARD: Who helped you there? Did anyone help you there? ANNA: What? EDWARD: Did anyone help you? ANNA: No. I ask them. They promise me I should get the help (?). It never come. I worked myself to death. EDWARD: Did you have any, were there any butlers or maids or people like that in that job? ANNA: Yeah. They were sort of a (Swedish). EDWARD: You must talk English. It was a . . . ANNA: It was a big, big room for the people, for their food. Big, big room. I should cook food for them, the help. Nay, I get tired of thinking of working. NASH: You get tired when you think about it? ( she laughs, Edward says something unintelligible ) Uh-huh. ( addressing Edward ) Well, why don't we go on to your trip to the United States, and what made, what were you doing, well, you said that you had just finished the military. ( voices can be heard in conversation in the background on the tape ) EDWARD: I had started doing some artwork for various stores and for some newspapers and magazines. And the last time I could leave was in March, so we had . . . NASH: Why do you say that was the last time? EDWARD: Well, it, I was getting past my twenty-first birthday. I had to get all the papers clear before I was twenty-one. NASH: In order to become . . . EDWARD: A citizen easily, as one could in those days, you see, because my mother was there, in the United States. So it was arranged with tickets and everything by March the 6th, I believe. So I came to the United States in early March, and it was a fairly small ship of the Swedish American Line, Drottningholm. And we had also quite a good storm there, but it was apparently not as dramatic as my mother's. And I was, felt perhaps a little bit of seasickness, but I managed to be around and enjoy the good food. NASH: Did you, at that time had you any kind of experience with the war that was coming, any effects that you had felt in your life, any political changes? EDWARD: Well, there wasn't, of course, any particular war going on then at that time. Hitler had taken over the reins in Germany in '33, I believe. But as far as any war being on the horizon there was, of course. Everyone was at that time happily appeasing Hitler, and there was no indication that any war was coming on. NASH: And that had played, so that played no role . . . EDWARD: It played no, it played no, uh, role at all. One was warned for the labor conditions in the United States, however, at the consulate, that it was a printed piece of paper one got, and when one talked to people there, that there was a very severe depression in the United States at the time. And everyone was told that it would be very difficult to find any employment. So that was, of course, a consideration. NASH: But did this, it didn't affect your thinking too much? EDWARD: Well, it was always possible to get back to Sweden again, of course, inasmuch as I had fulfilled all obligations as far as military service was concerned and all other things that might be difficult, cause any difficulty coming back. So, of course, I ( he clears his throat ) so there's no harm in trying. So I came over here, and, and I had met some friends from, who were, uh, people from the section, the section that was in Minnesota, people from Minnesota who were traveling in Sweden at the time, and they had, of course, advised me a deal, a good deal about the United States. And they were somewhat surprised too that I wanted to go to the United States under these depression conditions, but they also gave me some people I could get advice from when I came to New York. So I did meet some people here and decided this was a good place. Of course, I knew English quite well. NASH: I'd like to go back to the trip. You started to say something about food on the ship? EDWARD: Yeah. I did enjoy the food. I wasn't that seasick, and there was a bit of a storm, and it had, I remember that people I talked to were very much worried because there were extremes inundations in the United States, and they, when they landed they found out they could not take, regular train service was interrupted towards the Midwest. The lines were washed out and so forth. So they had to go a roundabout way, taking buses and things. So there apparently was, had been quite a storm just then, and when I came to New York there were large snow banks all along the streets, and there was all kinds of garbage piled up on the snow banks. It looked quite like a messy town, you might say, after all this, which seems to be the impression most people have when they come from Europe to New York, although I would say this was an extreme case. EDWARD'S WIFE: But you didn't go to Ellis Island. EDWARD: But I did not go to Ellis Island, no. NASH: You just got off the ship . . . EDWARD: Yes, yes, that's right. And the immigration authorities met us outside the quarantine. There were people who had any sicknesses or others, they were taken off there. But apparently I was healthy, and my mother said I was clean. I didn't have any head lice or anything like that. So there was not the slightest problem to land. But then after a while I got a job in an advertising agency and followed that line until the war, actually, when I got employed as, I had also did some work for the Swedish paper and through that knowledge of Swedish I was employed by the Army Service Forces in the language division, preparing language books and military dictionaries and such things in the Office of War Information doing work for the Scandinavian desk, which was transmitted to Sweden for, you might say, propaganda purposes, tell about the United States and what it was doing in the war, and so forth. But after that I went back to the advertising art again. And . . . NASH: Had you gotten back to Sweden? EDWARD: Well, it took quite a while. It was in '69. EDWARD'S WIFE: '67. EDWARD: It was '67, the first time after I left that I came back to Sweden. And it has changed a great deal, I suppose, but one still can recognize the things. It did, started to change before I left, so the change wasn't that great. It became the ( a chair can be heard scraping the floor on the tape ) great middle way just about the time I left. NASH: The great . . . EDWARD: Middle way, yeah. NASH: What does that mean? EDWARD: Uh, this was a phrase coined by an American author, Marquis Child, who went to Sweden in those years, in 1936, and wrote very favorably about the Swedish social conditions. They tried to take good care about all the Swedes from the cradle to the grave, you see, and this caught everyone's fancy in those days. And President Roosevelt sent a special commission to study this in the United States, and he said that this inspired actually the social ( a chair can be heard scraping the floor on the tape ) development in the United States from those, at that time. So Swedes felt they were doing fairly well with their social development. ( unintelligible female voice off-mike can be heard ) Yes. Of course, during the, during the war I met my wife. We were on, air wardens together, and we met in the dark, so to speak. NASH: Scanning the sky? ( she laughs ) EDWARD: Well, yes. Most of the time, it seems to me, we were going to cellars to see that they had reasonable shelters and things, but anyhow, that's how we met. And I . . . NASH: What neighborhood was that? EDWARD: It was right around here. I seem to have been living here all this time. So has my mother. NASH: If I may say so, this is the Upper East Side ( disturbance with the microphone ) that we are talking about. EDWARD: And eventually we got married, pretty soon, I guess. ( to his wife ) When did we get married? In '44? ( he laughs ) And some children arrived. We have three of them. All are grown up and are in various parts of the country at this time. NASH: What are your children doing? EDWARD: Well, one has, the eldest has just graduated from Columbia Law School and has a position with a law firm in Washington. The second boy has accepted a scholarship to get his Master's in French in the Berkeley University in California, and our youngest daughter is in Boston, I guess it is, a suburb of Boston? Where she, presently she is saving money to study, continued study, she is a graduate of Vassar, to study sociology. ( voice off mike ) So we . . . EDWARD'S WIFE: She's still finding herself in Cambridge. NASH: Mr. Karlsson's wife says she's still finding herself in Cambridge. ( she laughs ) That's a good place to look. EDWARD'S WIFE: ( voice off mike ) . . . to Sweden a lot earlier than we did. It was the matter of children, any education, why we did not return to visit Sweden in the 1940's as we had planned. It wasn't until 1967 that my husband returned and then I first got to see his home country. EDWARD: ( referring to his wife ) She comes from Maine, and the section of Sweden where I come from is very much similar to Maine, and I always said that if I could blindfold her in Maine where she was born and move her to my section in Sweden, she wouldn't be able to tell the difference, including such things as in her home town there they have signs saying, "Moose Crossings," which we discovered they have exactly the same and the same type of roads in Verblam [ph] where I, we came upon them while driving in Verblam [ph], which was really, really similar. NASH: Are there many Swedes living in Maine? EDWARD: Oh, yes. We have just discovered that there is quite a lot. This past week when we were on our vacation we visited what is known as New Sweden up there, which just had a one-hundredth anniversary. But there are several other sections there known as Stockholm and Besmalan [ph] and Jamflan [ph], which are very much Swedish settlements. And they still speak Swedish, even if they are third or fourth generation Swedes, they are a great deal of Swedish community life up there, keeping up Swedish traditions. NASH: Do you keep up Swedish traditions in your family? EDWARD: Well, I guess we have, to a certain extent, although our children so far have not been particularly interested in Swedish traditions. But my mother, of course, kept up Swedish traditions of Christmas and other things that she had brought from Sweden. Of course, in the Swedish circles around here they do keep up these traditions very much. Swedish folk dancing, Swedish Christmas, Swedish Lucia. NASH: What is Swedish Lucia? EDWARD: Uh, it's an old tradition that is, uh, a feast on the 13th of December. The, what they call the Queen of Light is being given a traditional welcome on that particular day because the old Swedes had the idea that this was the darkest day of the year, probably much farther back than this particular tradition of Lucia, which is, of course, borrowed from an old Italian saint with the name of Lucia. They say was brought over there, home to Sweden, by the old Vikings, and it lived on in certain sections of Sweden. But this girl is dressed in white with a red sash around her middle and a crown with lighted candles on top of her head, and she comes with a tray with coffee and good buns, Lucia buns. And in Sweden the idea is that she comes very early in the morning and she sings her song, waking up the people giving them this in bed, so to speak. And she has, usually, a few followers along, young girls, also help her sing and carry whatever further refreshments that they might want to wish, and a couple of boys who are known as star boys, with a staff with a star on following along, representing, I assume, those who took care of the horses and so forth in those days. The song indicates that the, yeah. They sing, the boys sing one song called, well, the Santa Lucia is not part of that, but they have another song that goes with it that is known as "The Staff And The Stable Boy," and presumably these boys are stable boys. So they are putting together quite a lot of tradition in these things, and lately this has become quite popular here in New York, too. So last Lucia was celebrated on ( a chair scraping on the floor can be heard on the tape ) Fifth Avenue where, at the time that the mayor had blocked off Fifth Avenue from 57th Street south, and they were ( there are repeated scraping noises, and also a bell heard in the background on the tape ) each year the Swedes select a girl, these days with the help of the popular press, for the Swedish Lucia, and she was over here at that time, and appeared together with several local girls, Swedish local girls here in New York on Fifth Avenue, and sang their songs, and also at the World Trade Center. NASH: And what time is this holiday? EDWARD: The 13th of December. And all the Swedish organizations around here select their own Lucia. And go through these festivities was singing and coffee and Lucia buns and so forth. NASH: And you were a reporter, is that right, a reporter for The Swedish North Star? EDWARD: Well, I am listed as the associate editor of the papers, but I do, yes, indeed, a lot of reporting, take a lot of pictures. And my wife is very good at developing and printing pictures, so it's sort of a family affair there. But there are many other people who contribute to the paper from their local organizations and so forth. So it's quite a community affair, all these many things that go on. NASH: How far do you send the paper, how far are the subscribers living? EDWARD: Well, they live practically all over the country, but most of them are along the East Coast from Maine to Florida. There is another Swedish paper in Chicago, and one in Seattle, and another one in Austin, Texas, and one in California, two in Canada. NASH: Are there many Swedes in Canada? EDWARD: It is quite a few. The Winnipeg area, I believe, has particularly many around there. And I would think there are some on the east coast of Canada too, it seems to me. Was it Toronto? ( he coughs ) NASH: Well, what's in the future for you, Mr. Karlsson? ( they laugh ) EDWARD: Oh, dear. Well, of course, we will naturally continue with our little print shop, and we continue with the work with the Swedish paper, but we have gradually become very much involved and interested in what certain sections of the Swedish community is doing for tracing and finding information about the immigration, especially from that section of Sweden where my mother is coming from. They have what they call an immigrant registry in that particular town. And the director of that is very much interested to develop a closer bond between those Swedes, there were a hundred thousand of them, who immigrated to the United States from that particular province between the years of 1850 and 1920. And, as a matter of fact, there were a million and a quarter Swedes who came to this country between those years, and that's about almost a quarter of the Swedish population in those days. So there are a great deal of interest in the Swedes who went to the United States, what happened to them, and where they, their descendants are now and what they are doing. So we are quite involved in finding as many (Swedish), as they are called, from this province. And, actually, we have started a special little organization which we call the Friends of (Swedish), to encourage the cultural exchange between these two sections in the United States and Sweden. And we do quite a bit of work together with them in this particular regard. NASH: ( addressing Edward's mother ) Mrs. Karlsson, is there anything that you would like to say on this tape, any last thing about your memories of coming, or your feelings about coming to the United States? MRS. KARLSSON: You (?) with some relatives. EDWARD: (Swedish) MRS. KARLSSON: (Swedish) I want to stay here. NASH: You still want to stay here. MRS. KARLSSON: Oh, yes. I want to stay here. ( Ms. Nash laughs ) I don't want to go away now. NASH: Okay. I don't think you will. ( Ms. Nash laughs ) MRS. KARLSSON: I like it very much. I think that's very much, I like it here. NASH: That's good. All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Karlsson and Mrs. Karlsson.
