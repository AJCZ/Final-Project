RADOSEVICH: Well, there were so many people in there you couldn't even, just full of people. I don't know what. MOORE: Did they make you wait in a great, in a big hall at all? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. MOORE: Do you remember that hall? And you had to wait . . . RADOSEVICH: I remember there was a lot of people in there. MOORE: Yeah. And how long did you have to wait at Ellis Island? RADOSEVICH: I don't know how long we were there. We must have been there a couple of days. MOORE: Did you sleep overnight there? RADOSEVICH: We stayed somewhere overnight. MOORE: In New York. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: So when you stayed overnight, I can tell if you were at Ellis Island or not if you tell me what you remember about overnight staying there? Where did you stay? What type of place? RADOSEVICH: Gosh, I don't even remember what it was, but I know we were there somewhere overnight. I don't know where it was. When there's a lot of people you, and kids don't care. MOORE: And you're small. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Okay. So then from there you went to where? RADOSEVICH: On a train. MOORE: On the train. Do you remember the station you left off? RADOSEVICH: I don't know. MOORE: Do you remember the day you landed at Ellis Island? RADOSEVICH: No. I don't know what day it was. MOORE: You said June, you mentioned . . . RADOSEVICH: June the 20th, I think. MOORE: The 26th or something. We'll get that later. RADOSEVICH: The 20th, yeah. MOORE: The 20th, okay. 1920. RADOSEVICH: 1920. MOORE: Right, okay. You were going on the train, then, to Rock Springs. And did they give you any food to take with you on the train? Do you remember? RADOSEVICH: No, we had to buy some. When we got to Chicago they were selling boxes that had food in there, crackers and salami and stuff. MOORE: And how did, did your mother speak English before coming here? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: And did your brother? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: So how did you buy things? RADOSEVICH: Well, you just show them what you want, or you take what they give you. ( she laughs ) MOORE: And was there anything new, any food or anything that you'd never seen before? RADOSEVICH: Ice cream, for one. MOORE: You'd never seen ice cream. RADOSEVICH: And bananas. MOORE: Did you eat bananas? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. We bought some, and we bought ice cream on the road. We'd never seen ice cream before. MOORE: What about bananas? How did you know how to eat them? RADOSEVICH: We didn't. ( they laugh ) MOORE: So what happened? RADOSEVICH: We had to watch what somebody else is doing. ( they laugh ) END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE MOORE: Go back a bit. We were talking about, you left Ellis Island, and you were on the train, and you hadn't seen anything, you hadn't seen ice cream, you hadn't seen bananas. What about the trip? How was the trip on the train? RADOSEVICH: Oh, it took us about three days to come, and they used to go, the conductors used to go around and give you candy, and then they'd come around and collect the money, and sometimes you didn't have it. ( she laughs ) So they were just out, I guess. MOORE: I mean, how about, this is the reflection of a little girl, actually, but how did you, did you sleep in beds overnight? RADOSEVICH: Oh, no. MOORE: You sat up? RADOSEVICH: We sat up. MOORE: Okay. And . . . RADOSEVICH: Yeah. That kind of train was just full of people when we were coming. MOORE: It was crowded. RADOSEVICH: Uh-huh. MOORE: And were the people that you knew from your town, were they on the same train? RADOSEVICH: Yeah, they were the same. MOORE: Were they sitting with you? RADOSEVICH: Yeah, close to us. MOORE: And you said three days, you changed in Chicago. Did you change anywhere else? RADOSEVICH: I don't think so, no. But I know we changed in Chicago. MOORE: The people in the same town that came over, were all you arranged? You said that your father sent, your father sent money. And the other people came from your town. And we've interviewed other people from the same town. How did you all get over here? Let's go back a little bit. Was there anybody who was helping you in your home town? Was there a priest helping you? Was there someone who was giving you advice? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. The priest from here helped us. MOORE: The priest from here. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Helped you. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Arrangements. RADOSEVICH: He told us what we had to do, because my mother, she had to go to Belgrade to get our passport, and I imagine there was a priest over there that they went to see. MOORE: So in terms of immigration, the church and the priest played a role. RADOSEVICH: Uh-huh. MOORE: And did they do anything else, the priests, that you know of? What was the name of the priest who helped you? RADOSEVICH: Father Schiffler here, but I don't know the ones over there. MOORE: Okay. Now, okay. So you're getting on, your train is coming into Rock Springs. What happened at Rock Springs? RADOSEVICH: Well, my father was waiting for us. We come at night, and the first time, the thing I saw was the, where the barber had this thing round and around. MOORE: Oh, the barber shop. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Yeah, the barber shop pole. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. We noticed that the first thing. It was at night when we came. MOORE: And your father was there to meet you. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. And he had a house that we went to. MOORE: A house where? RADOSEVICH: Right there in Rock Springs. MOORE: Do you remember the address? RADOSEVICH: There wasn't even an address down there. ( they laugh ) MOORE: And where was your father a miner? Which mine was he working in? RADOSEVICH: Right there in Rock Springs. MOORE: In Rock Springs. Okay. And where, how did he get you from the train home? RADOSEVICH: He had a car when we come. MOORE: A car? What type of car, do you remember? RADOSEVICH: A Studebaker, an old Studebaker. MOORE: An old Studebaker, okay. ( Mrs. Radosevich laughs ) Had you ridden in a car? Had you had a ride in a car before? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: Oh. So he took you in a Studebaker home. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: And did you have all your possessions with you, too? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah, what we had, yeah. MOORE: And do you remember anything new when you were arriving home? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yes. My, well, after we got home my mother said she thought there was going to be trees. There wasn't a tree in Rock Springs. MOORE: What else? RADOSEVICH: ( she laughs ) There was nothing but dust. ( she laughs ) No. And my dad had a phonograph for us, one of those little deals that turns, the thing on the phonograph when you turn the phonograph. My brother and I stayed up all night long playing that phonograph. MOORE: Is there anything else you had never seen before? RADOSEVICH: Well, nothing else. It was just nothing but, well, we went to town, and there was nothing there except wooden sidewalks, and a few stores, that the Slav people run. MOORE: Which stores were they? Do you remember them? RADOSEVICH: Yeah, Rock Springs Commercial was one of them. MOORE: And who ran that? Do you remember who ran that? RADOSEVICH: Somebody by the name of Gershishnik [ph]. They were Slav people. That's where everybody went. MOORE: And where else? What else was there? RADOSEVICH: Nothing. You buy everything there, just about. MOORE: Now, what about the house that you went to? Was it a house you went to? RADOSEVICH: ( she laughs ) Yeah, it was a house, but it was almost down under the ground. MOORE: You mean it was built into the ground? RADOSEVICH: Well, some of it was, the roof was on top. MOORE: What was the house made of? RADOSEVICH: Wood. MOORE: A wooden house? How many rooms was the house? RADOSEVICH: Just three. MOORE: Three rooms. And what rooms were they? RADOSEVICH: There was a kitchen and one bedroom on one end, and one on the other. MOORE: And what about, was there electricity? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: Okay, so what did you use for lighting? RADOSEVICH: A kerosene stove, I guess, or light. MOORE: Kerosene lights, yeah. And what about heating? RADOSEVICH: Well, we just had a cook stove. MOORE: And what about the furniture? RADOSEVICH: It was just a bed, was all that was in there. MOORE: It was just a bed that was in there. And how far from that house was it to the mine where your father worked? RADOSEVICH: Oh, he used to walk up there about maybe two or three miles. MOORE: And where, was the neighborhood that you lived in, where there other people who spoke the same language? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Do you remember learning English for the first time? RADOSEVICH: Well, the neighbors there, they talked Slav, and it was in the summer time and we were with those kids. When we went to school, why, the teachers couldn't understand half of them. But we learned. MOORE: What about the other family? Where did they go in Rock Springs, the family that was in the same boat and train with you? Where did they go? RADOSEVICH: Oh, they were right there in Rock Springs, too. They just lived a little ways from us. MOORE: Did they have children? RADOSEVICH: Yeah, they had a boy and a girl about our age. MOORE: And did you play with them? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: And what did you speak then? RADOSEVICH: Slav. MOORE: Right. And when you went to school, the teacher couldn't understand you. What happened? RADOSEVICH: Well, we just had to listen and learn. MOORE: And did you have any problems learning English? RADOSEVICH: Oh, kind of. ( she laughs ) MOORE: What do you mean 'kind of?' RADOSEVICH: Well, you just learn as you went. MOORE: Was it rough on you? I mean, was it hard? RADOSEVICH: Well, I imagine it was. Some of those things were hard, but you had to learn. MOORE: And did they ever call you any names or anything for being foreign? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. ( she laughs ) They called us "bull hunks." ( she laughs ) MOORE: Bull hunks? That's the first time I ever heard of that. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. That was one up the road. He always told us. We used to go call for his sister, and he says, "Here come the bull hunks." ( she laughs ) MOORE: Did he ever call you anything else? RADOSEVICH: No. He just died here not long ago, too, but I'll never forget that. ( they laugh ) MOORE: And what about at school, were the teachers nice to you? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. Well, they were nice, private teachers. But that's all they could do. MOORE: Were there other children in the same situation in the same class? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. There was a lot of different nationalities. I think there was maybe two or three different languages in there. MOORE: How far was the school from that house? RADOSEVICH: Oh, it wasn't very far. Like a half a mile from. MOORE: And you walked to school? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. MOORE: Now, your father picked you up in a Studebaker. Did he own that Studebaker? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: So from the beginning you always had a car. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: And what color was that Studebaker? RADOSEVICH: Oh, they were all black at that time. ( she laughs ) MOORE: Oh. They weren't big on colors. All right. So a little bit more about that house. The house had kerosene lamps, and you said it had a stove. What about plumbing? Did it have water in? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: No. And you had an outhouse then? RADOSEVICH: Yep. MOORE: What about water? Where did you get your water from? RADOSEVICH: From the pump. MOORE: You had a pump. Was it in the house or out? RADOSEVICH: No, outside. MOORE: Outside pump, okay. And how about in the school? How big was that school that you went to? RADOSEVICH: Oh, they had four grades. They had a big wood stove to keep warm. MOORE: And how were the, how were the, how was it arranged for you to learn? Did you have your own desk? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. Everybody had their desk. And the teacher would put stuff on the board, and you'd just have to learn it, I guess. MOORE: What did you write with? What type of . . . RADOSEVICH: Pencil. MOORE: Pencils, okay. And, okay. When did you realize that, when did it start happening that English was getting better? Do you remember? RADOSEVICH: Oh, just little by little you learn something different. MOORE: How about your mom? How did she adjust to it? RADOSEVICH: ( she laughs ) Took a long time. MOORE: Did she learn English? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. At the end there, she did. After us kids got to learn, you know, when we talked English, why, she picked up a lot. MOORE: So at home you spoke to your parents . . . RADOSEVICH: Slav. MOORE: Slav. Your parents spoke to each other . . . RADOSEVICH: Slav. MOORE: Did your father learn English ever? RADOSEVICH: Oh, a little bit down the line. MOORE: But he could get along with Slav. Okay. And did your mother go to work at all? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: No, she stayed home. Okay. Now, your brother, you said, died. What did he die of here? Do you remember? RADOSEVICH: I don't know. He got his leg bumped. I don't know what, they didn't even say just what it was, but he was sick about three weeks. MOORE: How long after you got here did that happen? RADOSEVICH: About two years after. MOORE: And how did your mother, how did your mother react to that death? RADOSEVICH: Oh, she felt bad. She walked from the hospital that day when he died. Of course, that priest was up there, and my father was working yet that day. But . . . MOORE: Did your mother have any other children after she came here? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. I had two sisters. MOORE: Two sisters. And what are their names? RADOSEVICH: Jane Bartow [ph] and Frances Williams. MOORE: Uh-huh. And . . . RADOSEVICH: They were both born here. MOORE: They were born here. How much younger are they than you are, than you? RADOSEVICH: One was about fifteen and one was twenty years younger. MOORE: Fifteen or twenty years younger. Okay. Did your mother, what was your mother's attitude about Rock Springs when she, in the United States, when she first came here? RADOSEVICH: She didn't like it. MOORE: Did she ever say why she didn't like it? RADOSEVICH: Well, it was altogether different. She just, she just didn't like it. There was nothing you could do. When the men worked there, why, that's where you had to stay. MOORE: Did she complain about anything tangible, like she . . . RADOSEVICH: Oh, she just didn't like all that dirt and everything. MOORE: And did she ever say she ever wanted to go back? RADOSEVICH: Nope. Because they didn't intend to go back. MOORE: How about your father? Did he ever mention that he wanted to go back? No. Okay. Now, what about religious life here? Did you, were you still religious when you came here? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. We went to church. MOORE: And where was the church? RADOSEVICH: Right there in Rock Springs. MOORE: What was the name of the church that you went to? RADOSEVICH: It's the church that's there now, St. Cyril and (?) Church. MOORE: And was that a church of Slovenians? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: So what was the language of the worship that you had? RADOSEVICH: Well, he spoke Slav and English, both. MOORE: And what about your religious life here? You said that you went every week when you were at home in the old country. How often did you go to church here? RADOSEVICH: Oh, we went every Sunday. MOORE: Every Sunday. Did you continue to have grace before meals? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: No. RADOSEVICH: Not over here. MOORE: You didn't keep up grace here. RADOSEVICH: Uh-uh. MOORE: How about evening prayers? Did you have those? No. Okay. How long did you stay, now, who was more religious, your mother or your father? RADOSEVICH: My mother was. MOORE: Your mother. Did your father go to church at all? RADOSEVICH: No, not much. As Father Schiffler says, "I know you're not going to go to church, but send the kids." ( she laughs ) The men at that time didn't go to church here. MOORE: What did your father do for fun? Was there any place, like a hall, he went to, or a bar or something? Or, what did he do? RADOSEVICH: Oh, no. It's that we all went together. MOORE: You stayed in the family in terms of, what did you do for entertainment, then, here in Rock Springs? RADOSEVICH: Well, just went visiting. That's about all. MOORE: You went visiting other families. And were other families of the same ethnic background? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Okay. Did you go to any dances? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. They had dances in that Slorensky [ph] Dome, they had dances on Saturday nights. MOORE: And the children went, too? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. Everybody took the kids with them at that time, wherever they went. MOORE: And what other things did the Dome have, activities? What other things? RADOSEVICH: They sold drinks downstairs and food upstairs. MOORE: And was that, do you remember that as being fun, as a child? RADOSEVICH: Well, I guess it was. We got something different. ( she laughs ) MOORE: Now, how long did you stay in this house that you first came to? RADOSEVICH: Oh, about four or five years. MOORE: Where did you move from there, then? RADOSEVICH: Well, my dad built a bigger house, bought a bigger house. MOORE: Did he built it himself or did he buy it? RADOSEVICH: No, he moved it in from another place when the mines closed up, and he moved that house in. MOORE: He moved the house? RADOSEVICH: Uh-huh. MOORE: And where did he move it? From where to where? RADOSEVICH: About two miles down the road, and he moved this, he took two pieces, two rooms at a time. Two rooms at one time and two at another, and then one in another, and put it all back together. Set it in one place, and then the big flood come, and about two years after he had to move it again, right across the road. MOORE: So, wait. How did he move it, though? RADOSEVICH: Oh, they had a, yeah, they cut it up. They had big timber. They had a way of moving things. MOORE: So he moved the whole house. And what was the address of that house, then? RADOSEVICH: The same thing, Clark Street. MOORE: Clark Street. ( voice off mike ) What? RADOSEVICH: 1217 Clark Street. MOORE: 1217 Clark Street. And how long did you live in that house? RADOSEVICH: Oh, I lived there till I got married in '31. MOORE: In 1931 you got married. All right. ( voice off mike ) Is it still there, that house? RADOSEVICH: Yeah, my sister lives in it. MOORE: Oh, your sister still lives in that house. Okay. And that house, the new one that you had, you said the flood came through. RADOSEVICH: Down the creek, yeah. There was a creek down there where, well, they got a lot of it filled up now, but there was a big water that comes in, and they made everybody move out there. MOORE: And so you had to move the house again. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Were you moved into the house already? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. ( she laughs ) MOORE: So he got the whole house ready, and he had to move it again. RADOSEVICH: Yep. Had to cut it up again and move it right across the street. MOORE: Who helped him? RADOSEVICH: Oh, those guys all pitch in together. They helped each other. MOORE: And so who was those guys? What friends? RADOSEVICH: Some other friends. I don't know, some other friends that he worked with. MOORE: This new house, how big was it? RADOSEVICH: Five rooms. MOORE: Five rooms. And five rooms, which rooms? RADOSEVICH: Two bedrooms. A dining room, a living room and a big kitchen. MOORE: So when you think back to your life in the old country and here, you used to eat meals, how did you eat in the old country? Did you eat them together? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. MOORE: How many meals did you eat together? RADOSEVICH: Well, not too many. Just whatever they had, like my mother worked, and we stayed with the grandparents, usually eat a big meal in the evening. MOORE: And did you do the same thing here in the United States? RADOSEVICH: Oh, we had regular meals over here. MOORE: How many meals a day did you have together? RADOSEVICH: Well, when my dad worked in the mine, boy, we had a big meal when he come home. MOORE: And did you continue to eat foods, traditional foods from the old country here? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. My mother cooked all the same, practically cooked all the same kind of food. Because over here you could buy stuff, over there you didn't. MOORE: And, now, tell me how your family adjusted. You said your mother never liked it very much. RADOSEVICH: Oh, she got used to it later on, but she sure didn't like it at first. MOORE: And how did your father react to that? RADOSEVICH: Well, it didn't make any difference to him, I guess. He had a job and he had to stay. MOORE: And he, did he like it here? RADOSEVICH: Well, he worked here, so. MOORE: What about the conditions in the mine? Were there accidents in that mine? RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. MOORE: Was your father ever involved in an accident? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. He was, about twice. I remember one time he had his leg broke, and he had one before we come over. MOORE: So what happened in the one before you came over? RADOSEVICH: Oh, he was hurt. I don't know how bad. But that was . . . MOORE: Who took care of him when he was hurt? Did he ask, did he belong to a union? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. He was in a hospital. MOORE: And did he ever consider not being a miner after those? RADOSEVICH: It's, that's what he was doing, and that's, they, that's what they done and stayed with it. MOORE: Did he ever consider going back home after an accident? RADOSEVICH: Uh-huh. No, he never mentioned. Well, I guess there was nothing back home, so. MOORE: What about other people who were in accidents? Did any of them ever return, that you knew? Did the people that you knew return back home? RADOSEVICH: Yes. There were some people that we knew over there that were here, and their son got killed in the mines, so they went back there. MOORE: And they went back to your home town? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Were there many of those people? RADOSEVICH: There was quite a few people that went back. They made some money here, and they went back. But they couldn't come back, because they didn't have their citizenship paper or something, so they weren't able to come back. But . . . MOORE: So they came for a certain amount of time, made money, saved it, and then went back. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: And they never come back again. RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: So when your parents came, do you think that they thought that they would stay here permanently, or did they think of doing that? RADOSEVICH: I don't think so. They never talked about it. MOORE: Talked about what? RADOSEVICH: About going back. MOORE: Okay. All right. We talked about the fact that your father and your uncle came on the same passport. Now, how, could you tell us a little bit about that? I mean, you mentioned that your father had a passport. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. Just what I heard them talking about it after they got over here. Because my uncle, he got a woman to come over and got married after. My dad had his family over here already. MOORE: Why would your uncle want to use your father's passport? RADOSEVICH: Because he had to go to the army if he didn't. He couldn't get a passport on his own. MOORE: And so he was in a hurry. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: So he used your father's passport and got through, and then what did he do? RADOSEVICH: Sent it back to my father, and my father came over on it. MOORE: Now, were they never caught on this? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: Were they ever frightened of being caught? RADOSEVICH: I don't think so. I don't know if they even worried them or anything. They didn't think about it. MOORE: So when your father came . . . MRS. RADOSEVICH'S SON: It happened in Trieste. MOORE: So when they looked at your father's passport and it was already stamped once, what did they say? RADOSEVICH: Well, they wanted to know why it was already stamped, and my father said, "My wife got sick and I had to come home." Then he went back, so. MOORE: Did your father or your uncle ever go back home after? RADOSEVICH: No, neither one. MOORE: Your uncle never did. RADOSEVICH: Uh-huh. MOORE: So there was no chance of catching them again. RADOSEVICH: No, I don't think so. MOORE: Okay. All right. Let me think of something else I want to ask you, is that why did your family, your father, come over here originally? What was the big push? RADOSEVICH: Well, everybody thought there was a lot of money here. MOORE: And . . . RADOSEVICH: They heard that people were making a lot of money here, so this priest, he got a lot of them over. MOORE: And why was the priest doing it? Why was the priest helping you? RADOSEVICH: Well, he knew everybody and anybody would just go to the priest to get help from him. MOORE: Okay. So you're saying, do you think that they were, your father was recruited in any way? Do you think that there was recruitment and such, or was it voluntary in terms of . . . RADOSEVICH: Just voluntary, yeah. MOORE: Okay. RADOSEVICH: He just knew he was going to make money over here, so . . . MOORE: And a better living. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Now, when you, now, briefly tell me how you met your husband and what happened. You said you married in 1931. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: And you lived at this address on Clark Street until 1931. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: How did you meet your husband? RADOSEVICH: Well, he was working in a meat market right there. MOORE: Right where? RADOSEVICH: Right around the corner. MOORE: From Clark Street? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: Now, had you gone through school then? RADOSEVICH: I went, I only went to the eighth grade, sure. MOORE: The eighth grade, okay. And then what were you doing after the eighth grade? RADOSEVICH: Nothing. I just stayed home. MOORE: You stayed home. And so you went to the meat, you met your husband there. How did you meet him there? RADOSEVICH: Well, I used to go over there and buy meat. I met him there. MOORE: And so what happened? Like, how did he get from giving you meat to taking you out? RADOSEVICH: Well, we just started dating. MOORE: And how long did you date? RADOSEVICH: Oh, a couple of years. MOORE: And where, when you said, where would you go on dates? Like, what did you do? RADOSEVICH: A show. That's all he ever wanted to do was go to the show. ( she laughs ) Movies. MOORE: And did you like doing that? RADOSEVICH: Well, that was something different, yeah. That's about all he ever done. MOORE: What about the dances? Did you go to the dances? RADOSEVICH: No, he didn't go to the dances. He just liked to go to cowboy movies. ( they laugh ) MOORE: But what about, your father was, I mean, your husband was how old then when you met him? RADOSEVICH: Twenty-three. MOORE: Twenty-three. Okay. And what did his father do? RADOSEVICH: Well, they had a meat market. They all had meat markets. MOORE: And was he born, your husband, in this country? RADOSEVICH: No, he came over. MOORE: Where did he come from? RADOSEVICH: Croatia. MOORE: Croatia. Do you remember the town he came from? RADOSEVICH: Mrkopal. MOORE: Could you spell that? Do you know how to spell it? ( voice off mike ) MRS. RADOSEVICH'S SON: M-R-K . . . RADOSEVICH: M-E-R, Mer, K-O-P-A-L. Mrkopal. MOORE: Okay. We can get that afterwards, too. RADOSEVICH: Yeah, it was right on there. MOORE: Okay. So what did you speak to your husband when you dated him? RADOSEVICH: Oh, we spoke English by then. MOORE: Well, here's, hold on. Here's the spelling. M-R-K- O-P-A-L, Yugoslavia. All right. Good, thanks. And so you spoke English with each other. RADOSEVICH: Oh, yeah. We could speak English by then. MOORE: What did he speak at home to his parents? RADOSEVICH: He spoke in Croatian. MOORE: In Croatian. But he speaks the same Slav as you did, ever? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: Okay. Now, you dated for a couple of years and went to a lot of cowboy movies. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. ( they laugh ) MOORE: All right. And so where did you get married? RADOSEVICH: In Rock Springs. MOORE: Where? Which church? RADOSEVICH: The same church, St. Cyril and (?) Church. MOORE: And who married you, what priest? RADOSEVICH: Dr., uh, Father Kennedy. MOORE: Father Kennedy. And was that the church that your husband's family went to? RADOSEVICH: Yes. They all went to that same church. MOORE: And so what happened when you married? Where did you live when you got married? RADOSEVICH: Well, we lived with my parents for a little while. Then my dad gave us the lot and we built our own home. MOORE: And where was that lot? RADOSEVICH: On Clark Street. MOORE: On Clarke Street. So then you had children. I should say, do you have children? Except we're sitting there with your children. ( they laugh ) RADOSEVICH: One, two. MOORE: How many children did you have? RADOSEVICH: Six. MOORE: Six children. Could you name them in the order, from the oldest to the youngest? RADOSEVICH: Sylvia's the oldest. We lost one. Sylvia's the oldest, then Fred, then John, then George, then Janice. MOORE: And did you, what did you speak to your children, what language? RADOSEVICH: Oh, English. MOORE: You spoke English. Did they learn Slav at all? RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: How about your mother and father? Did they . . . RADOSEVICH: Well, Sylvia spoke Slav while we lived over there with them for a while. Then after we moved, why, she forget it. MOORE: So how did your parents speak to your children? How did your mom and dad speak to your children? RADOSEVICH: Well, part English, part Slav. MOORE: And what about your father, your husband's father and mother? What did they speak? RADOSEVICH: Well, they spoke in Croatian. MOORE: And did they speak Croatian to your children? RADOSEVICH: Oh, what they, what they knew in English they, the father spoke English because he was here a long time before, but the mother didn't speak much. MOORE: Let's get back to the role of Father Schiffler. Was that his name, Schiffler? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: What did Father Schiffler's role in your life? What role did he play? How important was he? RADOSEVICH: Well, he was important. He's the one that got us all the papers to come over here. MOORE: And where was he, then? RADOSEVICH: He was in Rock Springs. MOORE: And why didn't he marry you? RADOSEVICH: Because he was gone by then. ( she laughs ) MOORE: Oh, he was gone by then. Okay. And so he was, until what years was he parish priest here? RADOSEVICH: Until about '30, 1930. MOORE: 1930. You just missed him. And then after him came Father Kennedy? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: What did Father Schiffler do during the time that he was here? RADOSEVICH: Oh, he was just a priest there. MOORE: He was a priest. And he married . . . RADOSEVICH: I . . . MOORE: And he also helped arrange these things, you said. RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: After he retired, where did he go, do you know? RADOSEVICH: I think it was Wisconsin, where they all retired, all the priests retired. MOORE: Now, did any family tragedy occur in your lifetime since you came from the old country? Was there a tragedy? RADOSEVICH: Well, just my brother that died, yes. MOORE: Your brother died. Okay. But your father, then, after he broke his leg in the mines, had no others. RADOSEVICH: No. MOORE: Did he stay a miner his whole life, your father? RADOSEVICH: Yeah. MOORE: What about your husband? What did he do for a living then? RADOSEVICH: He was a meat cutter, a butcher, all the time. MOORE: And what else did he do? Anything else? Mostly a butcher, okay. And, now, when you look back on your life now, you've lived in two countries. You've come a long way. What do you think about your parents' original decision to come here to the United States? RADOSEVICH: Well, just to live better I guess, that's about all. MOORE: Was it a good decision? RADOSEVICH: Well, I guess it was. Because they didn't have anything over there. MOORE: And you said you've been back, in our other conversations. How many times have you been back to the old country? RADOSEVICH: I was there three times. MOORE: And what, how did it change from what you remember? RADOSEVICH: Well, the first time when we were there in '62 it wasn't much changed, but then the last two times they got electricity, and they got everything that's modern now. MOORE: And when you see your cousins . . . RADOSEVICH: They got telephones now. The first time we were there they only had a telephone in a post office. That's the only place. But now they've got everything just like we do, probably even, probably even more. MOORE: Did you ever think of going back to live? RADOSEVICH: Oh, no. I don't want to go back to live, no. MOORE: When you went back there these times and you met your cousins or your relatives, was their standard of living the same as yours here? RADOSEVICH: Oh, they've got a lot of stuff over there now. MOORE: How do you feel, if you're going to identify yourself as a nationality, how do you identify yourself? Do you think of yourself as American? RADOSEVICH: Now, yeah, you do. MOORE: Do you think of yourself as two nationalities? RADOSEVICH: Not the other, you just forget that. MOORE: And if you were to give young people today advice of any sort, you've lived a long time now and seen a lot, what would you say? VARANTOLA (the recording engineer): We're running out of tape. END OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE ONE, TAPE TWO MOORE: All right. We were talking, and I said that since you've lived a long life now, what would you give as advice to young people in terms of a life perspective, what you've learned? RADOSEVICH: Well, stay with the job and do what you like to do. But they don't believe you that. They just want to do what they want to do, I guess. MOORE: And do you think that by working hard you can attain what you want? RADOSEVICH: Oh, I guess you can, yeah. MOORE: Well, I'd like to thank you on behalf of the Ellis Island project, ( Mrs. Radosevich laughs ) and we'll have to get these names afterwards. We'll send you a copy of this for your family records. And this is Kate Moore signing off in Farson, Wyoming on July 3, 1994 for the Ellis Island Oral History Project.
