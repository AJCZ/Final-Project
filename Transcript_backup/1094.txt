NASH: Today is March 20, I hope, 1975. I am speaking with Mr. Malachy McCourt who has a radio program at WMCA radio station in New York City. He was born in Limerick City, County Limerick, Ireland, and he came to the United States at the age of 20, in the year 1952. Mr. McCourt, tell me something about your childhood in Limerick. McCOURT: Well, Limerick is an old, it is the second oldest city in the British Isles. And it is an old garrison town. At one time or another the Normans were--the Danes founded it to begin with, the Normans occupied it and then for centuries then after the English were there. I t has old walls from the tenth century. You wouldn't recognize it too much today because it has Woolworth and MacDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken and fluorescent lights all over the place. Growing up there wasn't exactly, it wasn't very happy. My parents had seven children, six boys, two of whom were twins, and one girl. The girl died in infancy of what they call, I imagine today, crib death. The twin boys died, one died at four of measles complicated by pneumonia, and six months later the other twin died of no known medical causes. So our life, we lived in a sort of a, sort of a slum, it wasn't sort of a slum, it bloody well was a slum. My father worked sporadically as a laborer because the unemployment rate there was around, oh, I would say conservatively speaking, around twenty percent. Some men never worked in their lives there. So, we were constantly in poverty, constantly well, cold, constantly hungry. It would seem to me anyway. NASH: What did the men do who hadn't worked a day in their life? Did you have any kind of public welfare? McCOURT: Yes, there was. There was a dole, as they called it, which was for a man with a family was about three dollars a week. And then you got some assistance from various charitable organizations like Saint Vincent De Paul. They gave you seventy cents a week, and a bag of turf or coal every month. all that accompanied my intense humiliation, and pointing out that you were not working or doing anything, and that you were a lay about. So, consequently drinking and alcoholism was at a rather high level there. Came the was in 1939, many of the men immigrated to England because there was a lot of work in the factories and on the roads in construction there. And that lead to a break-up of many families because many men just forgot that they had families, including my own father. We didn't see him after a while because he also had a problem with the drinking, which then left my mother with four children and herself to pay--well, our rent was six shillings a week which comes to about a dollar, and she was getting thirteen shillings and six-pence a week. So that left another dollar or thereabouts for food and clothing and so on, so that affected us greatly. Now in retrospect, and in going to school, I wasn't able to comprehend what was going on. I was incredibly stupid in school because when you are sold, when you are hungry, it seems to me that one and one making two really doesn't matter when you stomach is rumbling or you don't have much to--it was a kind of hopelessness anyway that didn't lead to a great thirst for knowledge except one of my great avid interests in life always was my escape really, was reading. So, I would read anything I got my hands on. And I had read--I did read a great deal about america and the United States and I thought that is the land for me. Somehow or another, I left school when I was twelve and I wandered around the Continent. I wanted to join the Irish Army first when I was fourteen, and then they kicked me out when they found out I was that age. Then I went to England, wandered around there and worked on the Continent and so on, all over the place. In the meantime, my brother had gotten himself some sort of a job and he saved up enough money and he came to the United States. So then he was able to save money here, he worked as a bellboy at the Biltmore Hotel, he saved up enough money to send for me. So, I booked passage, or he booked passage, on the ship The America. And at that time a very strict country regulation, but it didn't bother me because I only had fourteen dollars anyway. NASH: Why did you come by ship at that time? You could have come by plane couldn't you? McCOURT: Well, the plane, I think, was much more expensive I believe at that time. And anyway that was the more ordinary way of coming. Most everybody came that way in '52 because the transatlantic steamers were still plying the trade back and forth. The United States, I think, either had or just about to break the transatlantic record. And the Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mary and the Sexsonian, and the Carpenthia, the Moritania and all those ships were, as well as the Ile de France, and the Michelangelo, and they were all still going back and forth. All packed and crowded too. So, I suppose I was, that was the most luxurious time I ever had in my life, was traveling on that ship, except that the waiters were constantly inferring that, and the stewards, that big tips were expected at the end of the voyage. I made a terrible mistake in that there was a swimming pool on board and I didn't have a bathing suit, so I thought I would go down and buy a bathing suit, not knowing what I was going to walk myself into. The cost of the bathing suit was ten dollars, and I was just too embarrassed to say that I couldn't afford it so there went more than three quarters of my fortune, my fourteen dollars. So, I paid out the ten dollars for the bathing suit and that left me with four. That had to last me for the journey. It was still pretty intact when I arrived here. When I got here, it was a very nice voyage, the food was terrific, and the entertainment was grand, and unlike the (?) ships of the older days when the Irish came after the famine. When I arrived, while I was on the high seas, my brother had been drafted into the american Army, so he was not there to meet me. It was June 17, 1952. I stepped off that ship and I was wearing an Irish tweed jacket and a flannel shirt, tie, and twill trousers, woolen socks, and heavy shoes. And I thought it was a joke when I stepped off because of the heat, it was 97 degrees that day. And I thought it was the exhaust or something from the ship that was causing all of this heat around here, but it wasn't. It was hot. So, there I was now standing with my bag, and my heavy clothing, and wondering, no sign of my brother. And no answer, I had yo have somebody telephone where he was staying and nothing. I finally got a friend of his who said he had been, gone in the army--I called his place of employment, that's what it was, and they told me he was gone off in the army. So, I made my way to the Salvation Army people, and then I rang up people I met on the boat who said they might help to get a job. So, they did, they helped me get a dishwashing job on Welfare Island now know as Roosevelt Island, at thirty-five dollars a week or something which was a vast fortune to me. NASH: When you came what was the situation in terms of a visa, were you coming on a tourist visa or a visitor's visa? McCOURT: No, I was coming on an immigrant's visa, yes. NASH: And that was easy to get at that time? McCOURT: Well, at that time the nationalities Act of '22, I think, was still--the quota thing was still in effect where there was, I think twenty-eight thousand English allowed in, and twenty-four thousand Germans, and seventeen thousand, five hundred Irish, which was never filled. And I think very inequitable there was only five thousand in the Italian quota. And I think there was one for the Philippines (?). Well, there was hardly any Asians anyway, or from Eastern Europe. So, it was a very, very unfair system particularly as, I think there was usually around ten thousand of the Irish quota left, left unfilled and certainly a larger proportion than that of the English quota. But, I wasn't aware of those little things at the time, I was only delighted to be able to get a chance to come here. And I found the people extremely decent to me. You know, I had a lot of dreams about America. I used to dream about it all the time, a dream about coming. And I didn't think people in the United States did ordinary things because I was influenced by Hollywood I suppose, and films I had seen. I didn't think the people, for instance, that garbage had to be picked up or that bread had to be baked or cows had to be milked or wheat had to be ground into flour, and so on. It was all that way. I didn't even want to think that there was anything ordinary about this country. And I thought that all people did here was drive around in cars and go up in lifts, elevators to offices and shuffle papers, and then go home to sumptuous banquets in chandeliered houses. I'm not, you know, I'm not stupid, but I-- NASH: You weren't well-informed. McCOURT: Well, it was just hat I didn't want to be. I didn't want to know the real truth that there was such a thing as death and diseases, illness and old age, and discrimination and so forth. I didn't think that that sort of thing existed here. But, to a large extent I suppose, that if you think in the relative terms of freedom and liberty, it's very difficult. It would be difficult to find a place other than the United States where it would exist in equal proportions. So, I found then--one of the things that I liked about here was being accepted, despite that fact that when I was in Ireland it was always, well, what school did you go to. Well, you couldn't mention the school because it was a ghetto school of less use than many of the schools here. Things like just switching on a light, we didn't have electricity. We shared the toilet with about eighteen other families out in the lane way. The unsanitary filthy conditions that we lived in where disease and death were rampant. And eleven of my school mates died between the ages of seven and eleven in Ireland. And my own brothers and my sister. And death was a way of life there, people just-- it just broke the monotony of life, death did. It was always a time of, well, the family had to do something, get in food and drink, and have a wake. It just broke up the daily rotten routine. So, coming here then and being able to switch on alight, and being able to read in bed at night, not by the light of a guttering candle, but by real modern scientific electric light. Telephones were a source of amazement to me and refrigerators. Get in somebody's car. Not mind you that I ever had great desire for material things, it's just that I like a degree of comfort. But, I found that people were very accepting of me in that, like in Ireland nobody ever listened to me because I was the wrong social class. The Irish are very socially class conscious people. It's a residue of oppression. You eventually become the thing you hate the most, and they become very English in that way. So, I found that they were snobbish and if you were yourself from a certain class, slum class like me, you would never get anywhere because people would always recall that I had no educational qualifications. And here I faked them a great deal. I always said that I had finished high school, and then once in a while I have given myself a college degree, and occasionally I have given myself a doctorate. NASH: Are you reviewing anything right now? McCOURT: I'm not. It doesn't matter really. I mean, if I want to call myself doctor, I'll call myself doctor. I can't call myself bachelor because I am well married, But, I can call myself master if I want to. Now, of course, the inverse, they invert the snobbery off. You sound like you are a college man, and I invert the snobbery and say, "Oh, no, I left school when I was twelve." See, which then says, "Oh, you must be a very intelligent fellow." "I am." Right, you see. So, you can have it both ways, and so I do. But here, for instance, I never heard about it, in Ireland they never told you about Irish literature. We never knew about the greater Irish writer, never knew about Swift or Wilde, to a certain extent maybe Oliver Goldsmith, but the comedies of Sheridan and Congreve, and we certainly never read Sean O'Casey. And Shaw was banned, and the short stories of Frank O'Conner, they banned James Joyce and Beckett, and people like that. And I never knew about those people till I came here and people would tell me about what a great heritage I had and I wouldn't know what a great heritage I had. So, that kind of forced me to read about them (?) in America it's all here. NASH: Would you say that you developed your Irish consciousness here? McCOURT: It seems that one is apt to do that when you leave, but then you would think he would go--many of the Irish, as with many other, other groups, sometimes to become proud of the wrong things. For instance, we are victims of the (?) of the Irish, you might say, I think as Yeats might have put it, in that we are victims of rubbish like Hollywood songs, "Mother McCree" and "Galway Bay" and "Danny Boy" and it goes on. And It's pretty revolting when we have this terrific heritage that only needs to be looked at, but some lyric writer in Hollywood who writes, "How are Things in Glockamora?", and even geographically it is crazy because, does it run down from Killybegs to County Clare. I mean that's a journey of about two hundred and fifty miles, impossible for a stream unless it turns into a river. So, I would say that the real consciousness did arise, and also from here, but also it made me aware of the fact that the divisions of people, the religious divisions, and we were having problems in Ireland. Problems, my God what a mild word. But going back into history, many of the, the majority of he great Irish writers were not Catholic. And a great many of the Irish patriots such as Robert Emmet, and Parnell, and people like that were all staunch Presbyterians, but they were Irish Nationalists. Like Thomas Addis Emmet is buried down here near Trinity Church. He is the brother of Robert Emmet and I think he was either governor or mayor of New York at one time. Another one, John Mitchell, he was a great Irish Protestant patriot. His grandson was mayor of New York in 1915. Anyway, so those bridges really showed me that religion had little to do with if they were imposed things on, to keep people divided. That one thing I learned anyway, that religion was used a barrier and meant to bring people together. Life has been rather good to me here I would say, and then, of course, I', egotistical enough to think that America is very lucky to have me. So I love this city and I have traveled a great deal around the country and I have found enormous courtesy, decency. I have found people to be terribly misinformed, terribly misled, terribly properganderized, but it is only a question of time till they get back to the truth, and they always do. As a witness, our recent political events where a vast majority of the people voted for one candidate and it turned out that he was a totally unworthy man. The strange thing about that is, of course, his unworthiness doesn't make the other guy worthy. NASH: Well, let me ask you, if you could just briefly tell me how a dishwasher on Roosevelt Island gets to have a radio program at WMCA? McCOURT: Well, it comes from, let me see, dreams. You see now you have to have dreams all the time and never allow them to turn into nightmares and never allow them to degenerate into ambition. It' sort of, this is what I would love to do, is what you have to say for yourself. And then you very easily and casually work your way toward it. Now I like to talk. At one time I used to think that you should not get paid for your talents. I thought it was something for what you do naturally, I should say, not your talents. I had always had an idea, well, perhaps I would like to perform, or something like that. I wasn't quite sure. And from the dishwashing I went to the docks, and then I used to go to the theater. And one night I walked back into a theater and said I wanted to act. So, I became an actor and that was fine. And then I was asked to appear on various television shows and then I did that. And then I wanted to make a, I thought I would like to make an album, so somehow or other that came about. NASH: What was on the album? McCOURT: Oh, some songs, and stories, and poetry. In terms of commercial America it was a massive failure. To me it was an artistic success. And then somebody once said to me , "Well, how would you like to have your own television show?" And I said, "That would be lovely." So, he did it and I was fired after about three weeks, which was alright too because I did it. And somebody asked me to be in a movie, I was in that. Then I heard this station WMCA was having, were going from an all rock station to all talk. So, I applied for it, a job as a talk show host. What experience did I have? Not much really, but I know a great deal about this area, and I think I understand a lot of what people are thinking, and what they are doing, and so a constant sort of interview so I finally got the job. And it allows me to do two things, it allows me to talk, and it allows me to talk about what I have read, well, three things, and then it allows me also to talk to people of the area. It sounds all very simple, it isn't really. NASH: I'm amazed though how simple it can be sometimes. If people really have ambitions, well, I shouldn't say ambition, but if they know what they want and if they just keep looking at it, and not get hung up, and this is particularly true for immigrants because they seem to be people with a lot of drive, you know, that the fact that they could leave their country and come somewhere, that already sets them, you know, they are a little bit apart. McCOURT: That comes from the prophet in his own land king of thing. That syndrome is, I mean many Americans are quite successful in Ireland, as indeed many Japanese and Germans are there too. I suppose it is because the foreigner, the immigrant has perhaps what may be termed an exotic quality or something like that, I don't know. But, people are more apt to be helpful to you, to the unfamiliar than they are to the familiar. We can be terribly unkind to our won. NASH: Well, is there anything else that you would like to say about having immigrated to the United States? Are you a citizen by the way? McCOURT: Yes. NASH: Why did you choose to become a citizen? McCOURT: Well, because in many ways it's convenience. By the way I'm--it doesn't matter to me one way or the other. You never lose Irish citizenship no matter what. You can take out a hundred other citizenships and ad far as they are concerned you are still Irish. Very sensible, civilized view of things. But it is convenient to a be a citizen in many ways. I mean, you can go off and stay out of the country for a number of years if you want without having to dash back and register as a resident alien sort of thing and so on. Due to the fact, say for instance, my father was born in North of Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom, also gives me British citizenship and so on. So, I have had all the passports as one time or other and it is more of a convenience, I think, that all national boundaries and borders be down and we wouldn't have problems with people, men. Mankind makes illegality. Do you see? If we didn't have sort of silly laws, if people had the option of moving like the buffalo did from place to place without (?), like the indians. They didn't care about that. They thought fences were strange apparitions of the white man. NASH: Well, that brings us to the question of illegal aliens. If there weren't, I mean let's say that, you know, immigration was open today as it was briefly or not so briefly in the history of the United States, would all the buffaloes come here, you know, I mean, now would you, how do you relate to that problem in terms of boundaries? McCOURT: Well, of course, people do seek the better life. And if say, people could learn American technology and science and ways of doing things, and you know that by their going back to their own countries and being allowed to out that into effect, people would move freely--most everybody has a nostalgia for the place from whence they came NASH: Not just a nostalgia. McCOURT: But, people have (?) deep, deep roots. I don't for some reason, I suppose because of the miserable tome I had in Ireland when I was a child, but many people do. They have better memories than I do, they have more happier memories I should say, not better memories. My memory is much better than most people for the long details. But, I think that if people went--if they could move freely they would almost invariably settle down and go back. People should be allowed to move. I mean, when you see things, misfortune of Jews not being allowed out of the Soviet Union. You see millions of, of any Russian not being able to move at will. The Indian government has restrictions. They don't put political restrictions on you in India, but the foreign exchange is so rigid that you can't move, you see, because you are spending the little bit of resources they have in dollars. There should be a common currency. Most any of these restrictions are, somebody is making a profit on it, somewhere, somehow. NASH: Their control means somehow that they are using you. Well, if they keep you there they will use you. If they let you go, that serves their needs too. McCOURT: So there's no--I don't see anything--the term illegal aliens make it somewhat sinful or something like that. We are all illegal aliens. I mean if you ask Sitting Bull , he would tell us very soon or any of the other Indians, they would tell us we are all illegal aliens. So our laws are determined by who sets them up and for what purpose. NASH: Determines who are the criminals. McCOURT: Yes, yes. NASH: Okay, well thank you very much. McCOURT: It was a pleasure. Thank you.
