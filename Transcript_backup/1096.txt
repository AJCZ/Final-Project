LEVINE: I'm here today on April 12, 1994 with Mary Marguerita McGloin, who came from Ireland in 1922 when she was fifteen, about to turn sixteen years old. Well, I'm happy to be here, and I'm sorry we're late. ( she laughs ) And I want to thank you for having us, and I'm looking forward to hearing everything that you can remember. Okay? Let's start at the beginning. Give me your birth date, and where in Ireland you were born. McGLOIN: I was born in Blackeron [ph], County Mayo, Ireland. That's the west of Ireland. LEVINE: And your birth date? McGLOIN: It's November 24. LEVINE: 19, the year? McGLOIN: '06. LEVINE: 1906. Okay. Now, did you live in the same place up until the time that you came to America? McGLOIN: Yes. LEVINE: What do you remember about where you lived, the town, the people? McGLOIN: Well, we came from a small town, incidentally. They had, in the town, which was about three miles, plus you had to walk that. You had to go to lakes. And, what was I going to tell you? LEVINE: You were talking about the town, what it was like. McGLOIN: Oh, they, the post office, their name was McGloin also, the post office, and another store, but no relation of ours. Because we came from, my husband came from Sligo. LEVINE: Where, can you spell where he came from? McGLOIN: S-L-I-G . . . LEVINE: I'm going to take this so it doesn't pick up noise, okay, from that? McGLOIN: Okay. S-L-I-G-O. LEVINE: Uh-huh. McGLOIN: And I came from Mayo. Did you ever hear of Knock [ph]? LEVINE: No. McGLOIN: You didn't. LEVINE: Could you describe the house you lived in? McGLOIN: It was a thatched cottage. And everyone had their job to do, and it just better be done. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: What were your jobs? McGLOIN: Well, my job, I was the big boss. LEVINE: ( she laughs ) What was your father's name? McGLOIN: Patrick. LEVINE: And your mother's name? McGLOIN: Costello. Annie Maloney. LEVINE: And you were the oldest child? McGLOIN: Uh-huh. LEVINE: And then what were your brothers and sisters' names, just going down the line from the oldest down. McGLOIN: Well, I was the oldest. LEVINE: You were the oldest. McGLOIN: And then I had a sister Bridgy, and after her came (?). And then my brother, there was seven brothers. There was James. See, there were so many, Costellos was my maiden name. And we were (?)'s kid. LEVINE: Say that again. You were? McGLOIN: (?)'s kids. My father used to go to England, you know, because they didn't have work in Ireland. And he went to England to make some money in the harvest time, and he worked in the pits. And that's how they, that was just to distinguish all the Jameseys. Because there was Jamesey Costello, Michael Costello, and, you know, Jamesey Andy, Michael Andy, you know. This is the way it runs down the line. LEVINE: Where were the pits? McGLOIN: In England. LEVINE: Uh-huh. What kind . . . McGLOIN: Coal pits. LEVINE: Coal pits, uh-huh. McGLOIN: Yeah, coal. LEVINE: So he would be away for periods of time, then? McGLOIN: Yeah. Just a couple of weeks at a time. LEVINE: Uh-huh. What was your father like? How would you describe him? Is . . . McGLOIN: Very quiet man. Yeah. And that's the kind of a husband I married, too. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Uh-huh. Were you close to your father? McGLOIN: Yes. We were, you always give a hand. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And how about your mother? What was she like? McGLOIN: My mother had been here before she got married. And there's a picture of her here somewhere. LEVINE: How long did she stay before she went back? McGLOIN: Five years. She had seven sisters out here, so she came to them. That's why she let me come. Because one of our sisters was, you know, had an operation or something, and they were always good to their mother. See, my mother went home because her father and mother were there alone, and they wouldn't leave them alone. They had a little more thinking in them days of the older people than they do now. She went back from here, and then she got married. LEVINE: Did she work when she was here? McGLOIN: Yes, yes. She came to the, to her sister's, but everybody had his own thing to do then. You know, just because you had a few girls, you didn't have a lot of money. They had their own families to take care of. LEVINE: And, um, so, uh, where was she living when she was here? McGLOIN: She was living in Brooklyn. Uh-huh. Down in Brooklyn Heights. Do you know where that is? LEVINE: Yes, I do. Uh-huh. So then she came back, and did you ever hear the story about how your mother and father met? McGLOIN: They grew up together, went to school together. So, Ireland is not such a big, wild place, you know. But we had a small place. And you tried to make the best of what, there was eleven kids and (?). LEVINE: So you went to school. What was school like for you in Ireland? McGLOIN: The same as any other kid going to school. LEVINE: Did you like school? McGLOIN: Oh, yeah. You held out your hand, and if you were quick enough you pulled it back and let the teacher get the pointer on the legs. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: What else do you remember about school? Do you remember any of your friends, or what you did after school, or any of those things? McGLOIN: Everybody had their own chores to do. You didn't look to go playing, or you didn't look for money to be paid for, like the kids do here. We had our own chores to do, and you'd have to go, we didn't have water in the house. We had to go to the well for it. Mother would say, "You know, you'd do better if you'd carry two cans. It would balance you good." That was her way of trying to tell, "Don't be just going for just one can of water." LEVINE: Where did you have to go for the water? McGLOIN: Oh, we had several fields to cross to get the spring water, and God forbid that anyone went to that well or lake, you know, no cattle or anything could drink out of it. It was always covered with a tree or something to keep it clean. LEVINE: So then you'd have to lower the pails into the well? McGLOIN: You stooped over and filled the pail. It wasn't a big well, you know. It wasn't a big well. But we still found a lot of fun and a lot to do, and, you know, we had our own jobs. LEVINE: Were there, did people grow any food around where you lived? McGLOIN: Of course. LEVINE: What did they grow? McGLOIN: Potatoes, turnips, cabbage. LEVINE: And how about livestock? McGLOIN: Yes. We had a horse, and we had three cows, and we had a donkey, and we had a sow that had (?). Like, when we were kids you would get a pet, you know, if a pig had a baby, litter, and you raised that pig to a couple of hundred pounds. And then that was killed, and it was smoked for the winter months. And, uh, it didn't have to be, you know, you killed it that way, with the smoke, because you hung it up in the roof, in the ceiling. LEVINE: Right, where, in your living quarters, did you hang it? McGLOIN: Yes, yes. Uh-huh. LEVINE: And do you remember your favorite dishes that your mother made, things that you really liked to eat when you were little? McGLOIN: Oh, yeah. She was a good cook. We used to love rhubarb pie, blackberry pie. We'd spend all day coming home from school picking berries. Get our clothes all stained, get a licking. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Who was strict? Was your mother or father the disciplinarian in your family? McGLOIN: My mother. LEVINE: Mother. McGLOIN: ( she coughs ) My father was a very quiet man. ( she clears her throat ) He liked to read. You could give him seven or eight numbers, maybe more, and while you were writing them down he had the answer for you. LEVINE: How about music? Was there anybody who was musical in your family? McGLOIN: Oh, yes. We had plenty of dancers, music. Uh, you will have, I'm sure you will have seen the bagpipes, and the accordions. My mother used to play the accordion. LEVINE: How about you? Were you musical at all? McGLOIN: No. No music up there. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: How about dancing? McGLOIN: Dancing, yes. We used to have nice parties. You got parties in the fall. LEVINE: Why in the fall? McGLOIN: When the work was all done, to thank who helped. Because the work didn't get done without putting it in the ground, you know what I mean? Potatoes had to be slit, they had to be put in the ground, and all us kids had our own job to do, you know. And then, like, neighbors, all the neighbors had come to split the potatoes, and come to help put them down, you know. LEVINE: Did you help in planting the potatoes? McGLOIN: Sure. You had to. You had to. Everybody had to help. We even had it set up so that we had a very rocky land full of stones, and that was the kids' jobs to pick up the stones and make piles out of them, and they put them making rows, you know, wider rows and that kind of stuff later on, after my time. LEVINE: So every spring there'd be new rocks to pick up before the planting? McGLOIN: Oh,yeah, sure. And they used to haul them away, you know. I'm sure you must have heard of Cropatrick [ph]. You didn't? LEVINE: I don't think so. ( she laughs ) What about it? McGLOIN: It was a mountain where the Blessed Mother appeared. LEVINE: Ah. And did, was that something that you were aware of when you were a little girl? McGLOIN: Yes. Because you climbed the (?). There was a big indulgence in that. LEVINE: So did you climb that mountain every year, or . . . McGLOIN: There were certain times of the year that you went, you know, certain times. My mother, it was six miles to the creek. And my mother would be back from there before half of us would be up in the morning, walking, walking. Not riding a bicycle or anything else, because people didn't even have a bicycle then. Very few had bicycles. But, uh . . . LEVINE: So what, what would happen? You would climb the mountain, and then what? McGLOIN: Well, you went to mass up there. LEVINE: Do you remember any other religious observances that you, uh, that you took part in when you lived in Ireland? McGLOIN: Oh, yeah. Well, Knock [ph] was another place we used to go to, Knock [ph]. It was a religious, you know, place, too. And they shut down the whole town, you know, for, for the day because there was mass and everything, you know, like that. And they have fair days. LEVINE: What were they like? McGLOIN: Oh, that's where you took your goods to be sold, to the fair. And, of course, all the cattle and sheep and what have you. Did you ever see sheep? LEVINE: Uh-huh. McGLOIN: Oh. LEVINE: Did your family bring things to the fair to be sold? McGLOIN: Of course. LEVINE: What things did you bring? McGLOIN: Well, mostly it was young calves. That's why they always, they have a certain day for each thing. Like there was a fair, a fair day for selling pigs, for instance. That's another thing what you used to have to do. The (?). Somebody had to stay up with her all night so that she wouldn't fall on, on the pigs. You had to put the young ones to eat, you know. So that was a great thing when you were little, to be allowed to stay up, you know. LEVINE: How old were you when you were first allowed to do that? McGLOIN: Oh, God, I don't know. We did things young there, you know. You weren't babied like the kids are here. You had your work to do. You had to go and gather the eggs, gather the pigs, or whatever you had to, you had to, and get water and bring it in for the night, and for the morning. Make sure that it was covered, that you didn't, you know, let anything fly into it. And we had school. School closed there in the summertime. We had school all winter. And we had lovely, lovely teachers. They were very interesting people. LEVINE: Do you remember any of your teachers by name? McGLOIN: Yes. They were just the one family. The father and mother taught my mother, and this were the daughters that were there. ( she coughs ) In my time, Kathleen Judge [ph] and Mary (?). But, see, it wasn't a great big school either, you know. It was just like a neighborhood. Each district had their own school. LEVINE: But were there separate classes? McGLOIN: Yes, but all in the one room, in the one classroom. It might be thirty people, maybe more or less, you know, depending on the families. Some people liked our school better than others, and they come from another village down to our school because the Judges were very good teachers. You know, they were not the old time. They were young ones. Because, I guess, in the old time I don't know if they went to college or not. LEVINE: I don't think early on they did. McGLOIN: No, I don't think so either, because I remember the master, he had a big, long whisker going all the way down, and I don't think he ever went to college. I couldn't tell you the truth. But, uh, they were, my mother kept after them, too. You know, she just didn't send us to school. She was there to see what was going on. So that I, with my kids here, when we were going to school, because some of these teachers, all they wanted is put them in the back of the class or stick them in the cloakroom or whatever if they did something wrong. So I made myself known up in school when I sent my kids to school. I said, "I'm very capable of hitting my kids. I'm sending them up here to learn, not to be stuck in a clothes closet or in the back of the room." So when you talk up, you're counted. That's all I can tell you. LEVINE: So do you think you took after your mother? McGLOIN: I did. 'Cos my father was very quiet. His mother died when she was very young, sixteen or something. LEVINE: Did you have grandparents that lived near you in Ireland, your mother's parents? McGLOIN: In the same house. LEVINE: Oh! McGLOIN: That's why my mother went home from here, I told you, to take care of her parents. LEVINE: What do you remember about your grandmother or grandfather from when you were in Ireland. What were they like? What did you do with them? What kinds of things do you remember about them? McGLOIN: I remember them well, because I know I wasn't able to walk when, you know, they'd carry me on their back, you know. LEVINE: When you were little, you mean? McGLOIN: Yeah. You had no things like they have nowadays, bicycles and wheelers and rollers. You just used shanksnare. And the same to go to church on Sunday. Nobody dragged you there. You went. You knew it was your duty. And there was certain, you know, days that were holy days and everything, so they went there then, too. LEVINE: Well, now, how was it decided that you would come to the United States? McGLOIN: How was it decided? Would you want to know something? I came to the United States because my mother had a sister here. I think I told you that. She had seven sisters, and one of them had been very good, sending money over there and everything else, to my mother, was, had an operation, a bad operation, and they sent me out for to help her. And I was supposed to go to school. Instead she had a boarding house. So I didn't get to school. So I got jobs, and I came here in the height of the Depression. You don't remember the Depression. LEVINE: No. McGLOIN: Well, they're calling this a Depression, but that was nothing like the Depression then. There wasn't a job for nobody. Everybody said, "What are you letting her go now for? She'll be walking the streets. There's no jobs over there." Well, I wasn't here very long when I took my father out here, and he was two days in this country when he was working. LEVINE: So you sent him the money to come here? McGLOIN: Yes. LEVINE: Well, um, how did you feel about coming? When you were leaving Ireland and you were coming here? McGLOIN: I was delighted, until I got here, and I was so sad. Missed my family. We were never away from each other, you know. Missed my family and everything, and I hated my mother for letting me go, because I missed all my brothers and sisters, and, you know, it was a big, a big change. LEVINE: What was your aunt's name, the one who was sick that you came to help? McGLOIN: Finnigan. LEVINE: And her first name? McGLOIN: Delia. LEVINE: Delia. So were you, were you close to Delia, your aunt Delia? McGLOIN: No. LEVINE: No. McGLOIN: I wasn't close to any of them, because in them days you did what you had to do, you know. But I want to tell you, I was never out of work, never out of work, in the Depression or any time. You name it, I did it. LEVINE: So it was your aunt Delia that had the boarding house. McGLOIN: Yeah. LEVINE: And so you started out working there? McGLOIN: No. LEVINE: No. McGLOIN: I was going to New York, and I picked up the paper in the subway, and I read the Help Wanted, and I got myself, going to call up about this, and I got myself a job up in the Catskills in the Jewish, you know . . . LEVINE: Hotel? McGLOIN: The Jewish hotels, because I never waited on a table in my life. But I had nerve enough to go up there. I stood, and I watched all the other girls, you know, go up, that weren't in the big hotels on that way, going from Florida, and worked all their lives there. And, uh, I let them talk before I got my station. And I got a good station. And, uh, I made money, and they wanted to throw me off the bus coming home because I made fifty dollars for the ten days. It doesn't sound much today, but at that time it was a lot of money. LEVINE: So that was your first job here, in the Catskills? McGLOIN: Well, that's only in the Jewish holidays. I had read about it in the paper. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO McGLOIN: You know. LEVINE: So what else did you do for work? McGLOIN: ( she laughs ) You really want to know? You know where Bush Terminal is? LEVINE: Bush Terminal? McGLOIN: Yeah. It's in Brooklyn. I got a job down there. I got a job on Wall Street. I took my, in the meantime my sister came out here, and I took her to the telephone company, and they wouldn't take her because she had a brogue. So I got the job. LEVINE: You didn't have a brogue. McGLOIN: Well, I was here well ahead of her, a couple of years, and (?). So I took the job, but I didn't stay long with it. I went downtown New York on a private switchboard, and I didn't work such grating hours as the phone company. And in them times the phone company was like, what do you call it, in New York. You had to walk a straight line, or you were out the door. They didn't have people working for them like they have today, because you said one word out of order and you were gone. Which, I worked, I was never out of work. Let's put it that way. LEVINE: Did you stay living with your aunt? McGLOIN: No. I got different jobs. I stayed there just because I had to have a place. I was underage. And I got different jobs in different places. When I was with the phone company, I was working evenings, and I had the whole day to look for jobs, you know. LEVINE: Well, when did it change for you? AT first you were unhappy here because you missed your family. When did you start to enjoy being here? McGLOIN: Very shortly, after I got to know people, and got working and, you know, this, I got working and I had jobs. I worked down in the garment district. I worked down in the pickle district. I worked in, you name it, I worked there. Because I could get a job very fast. LEVINE: Did you have a social group? Did you know other people? McGLOIN: You get to know them. LEVINE: What did you do for enjoyment when you were here? McGLOIN: We had dances three nights a week that we went to in New York, and went to work the next day. LEVINE: Where would the dances be held? McGLOIN: They had halls for those dances, nice music, (?) music. And you met people, and you talked to people. You weren't by yourself. There was a crowd of us went. We took the subway and went up to New York, at least three nights a week. LEVINE: And how did you meet your husband? McGLOIN: That, he, he had relations, marriage, in the family. And him and my husband were in business together. During, when the taverns opened up in '32, they opened a tavern, the two of them. LEVINE: It was your husband, and who was the other person who opened it? McGLOIN: My husband and my brother. LEVINE: Oh, uh-huh. And where was the tavern? McGLOIN: In Brooklyn. There was taverns all over back then when the beer came back. LEVINE: So you must remember Prohibition. What do you remember about that? McGLOIN: Oh, I don't remember much about that because everybody made their own beer, made it in the bathtub. The hops and the malt, and everything like that. Because nobody, nobody could, you know, get and sell beer. Although there was soft drinks, you know, on the towns, you know, like soda and that kind of stuff. LEVINE: So what did your father do when he came over? McGLOIN: What kind of work? LEVINE: Uh-huh. McGLOIN: He was a Welshman. He did nothing. He worked for Edison and got away with as much as you could, that's all. LEVINE: So did you stay in Brooklyn when you got married? McGLOIN: Yes, yes. LEVINE: You were living there? McGLOIN: You want to know something? LEVINE: What? McGLOIN: I got married, you're not going to believe this, but just as sure as you're sitting there, I did not have five cents to my name, not five cents. And my husband had no job, and we got married anyhow. We had no doubt that was depression time. It was a lot of fun. We got married, and I never, never took money from the city for welfare or for anything in my life. Now, after we got married, I was living in Flatbush, and by now I had two kids. And I decided I'm not going to pay rent any more. I lived in a two- or three-family house near Sears Roebuck. And just like that, I went and looked at a house and bought the house. And I borrowed a couple of hundred dollars from my sister-in-law. No, nothing there. No job, no nothing. And I got the money, and I bought the house. So then I started having a family and my son was there, as he'd be able to tell you. My kids had the best life when they were little because what are you going to do with kids with nickels and dimes in the summertime? So I said, "Hmm. I'm going down to Jersey." So I went down to Jersey, and I bought not one bungalow. I used to go to Jersey before I was married, on vacation with my father from, you know, my sisters and things. And I went down and I knew this, I stayed in these bungalows at one time. They were, you know, close together, attached, if you want to call it. And I said, "That's the place for me." Well, I was always a sewer. My mother was a sewer and a knitter, you see, all them, what do you call it, I made? LEVINE: Afghans. McGLOIN: I can't make them any more. But, anyhow, their underwear that the elastic went out of, I took that and I made shorts for my kids so they wouldn't be sticking together when they went to the water. And they had the best life you ever knew for nothing, because they had the water all day long there beside them. And I'd watch these schoolteachers, they were from Newark, and their parents before them had these bungalows, and I went and I, now they're selling them. They're getting too old for any of this kind of stuff, so they're retired and everything. So I bought the bungalow. It was three rooms, double on both sides. So my husband was sanding, he made the back porch meeting place, he made a big, wide table that we could all sit at. He made a bench that the kids could sit there and they didn't have to come in the kitchen. And I had company coming out both ears, you know. When you have a place in the country they want, there's a place called Keyport, it's down around Union in Jersey, and we, my sister and my brother and my sister-in-law, she could drive, and we used to take trips down to Long Branch and, you know, all through. Seagate, and to the different places that they didn't get bored at, you know. We went to Red Bank. They had a nice shopping center. I don't know if you ever heard of, uh, what the heck is the name of that restaurant that I used to love to go to, their food was very good. We used to, to go to Atlantic Commons. I'm sure you heard of that, maybe. But they had beautiful restaurants there, out on the water and everything. It was nice. LEVINE: Well, um, just to back up for a minute, what was the name of the ship that you came on when you left Ireland and came here? McGLOIN: Huh? Now you're putting me to. Scythia, was it? LEVINE: The Scythia. And when you, do you remember the Scythia coming into the New York Harbor? McGLOIN: Yes. I remember the Statue of Liberty. LEVINE: Do you? McGLOIN: Uh-huh. Because my mother always talked about the Statue of Liberty. She loved it here. She was sorry that she had to go, you know, back, because she spent five years here. And all her sisters were here, naturally. She liked it. But, see, the water lines on the docks and everything were different years ago than they are now. We used to, I used to take the kids on boat rides down to Jersey all the time on a Sunday afternoon or a weekday, because it was only a quarter or maybe ten cents for the kids, you know. And you made do with what you had. ( she coughs ) LEVINE: Do you remember Ellis Island? McGLOIN: Yes, I do. LEVINE: What was your impression of that? McGLOIN: Well, I couldn't get out of there fast enough, that's all. It was just like I had heard. My mother said, see, her, one of her sisters was supposed to meet me, and she was not there on time. And they could have turned me back, you know, because I was under age, and nobody was there to claim me. But this aunt, they came late. They were always like (?) in that life, you know. They just didn't keep time like they could have. And they were all married, and they had all kids, you know. I didn't like it, because I had heard nasty stories about it. LEVINE: What had you heard? McGLOIN: Well, about the food, and that you're treated like animals, and you're choked up, you know, with other people, in bunks. And I found it to be so, but I wasn't there long enough. I was only there one day. LEVINE: So you slept over, did you sleep over, or you left the same day? McGLOIN: Sleep over where? LEVINE: At Ellis Island. McGLOIN: Oh, yeah. We got off. We got off the boat, you know. And I went with somebody called, for me I left and went to my aunt's house, because I have lots of aunts, and seven of them. LEVINE: Do you remember what struck you as different those first few days and weeks when you were in this country, what was different about America than, than what you were used to in Ireland? McGLOIN: I knew all about that. My mother had taught me about that. And I was, you know, willing to take a chance. I brought, in a short time, I brought my father out, I brought all of my brothers out, I helped bring them out. That's what. I got them jobs. My father worked in Con Edison. My mother didn't go to work. She stayed home. But she did a lot of work around, you know, the house and everything, because she was a good sewer. And we had our own sheep, and you had to spin that thread and make your own yarn. You know, you didn't get things made just handmade like you go into a store here. LEVINE: Did you have anything to do with spinning it? McGLOIN: Of course, I did. And cording. You had to make rolls of the glue and spin it in a spinning wheel. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: So then you spun it, and then you knew how to knit, and you knew how to sew? McGLOIN: We were taught to knit in school. LEVINE: Oh, uh-huh. McGLOIN: You, you know the quills of goose, turkey? Their wings have big quills. That's what we were given to knit with, not knitting needles to hurt you, because we were maybe four or five years old. They got rid of you pretty quick at home, sent you off to school, bother somebody else. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Do you remember how you felt when you first came, being new to this country and being an immigrant here? McGLOIN: Yes, yes. I was made at my mother. I thought I'd never talk to her again. But that madness wore off as I got older, you know. I said, "I will never let my child go like you did, sixteen years old." Of course, I was sick like two dogs on that ship on the ocean. ( she coughs ) That time you had to come, first of all you had to go for all the different examinations, this, that and the other thing, and you had to come across to England to get the boat there. I think I left from Queenstown. And it takes a long time, the boats. They're not as equipped then as they are now, you know. LEVINE: Do you think having been in Ireland for practically sixteen years, the first sixteen years, and then coming here, do you think that made a difference in the rest of your life? How do you think it affected you, having started out in Ireland and then changing your country and starting out again? McGLOIN: Well, you make your place in the world. Soon when you have nobody else you realize that you're going to fight for yourself, and I have fought for myself and for my kids all my life, because when my kids were going to school, I let the nuns go, understand. Because I was into everything in the church, the different organizations. The nuns that were there then, they were all fresh out of school themselves, and they didn't know from nothing. So I made myself known. I was in the Rosary Society, I was in all different things, helping out for trips and everything. And I told, I went up, I went to the nun. I got no satisfaction there. And, uh, then I went to the pastor. I went to the principal, and then to the pastor, until I did get satisfaction, because we had a long walk to school. It was one mile each way, and there was no buses in them times. LEVINE: Where was this? McGLOIN: In Brooklyn, Bensonhurst. I lived on 53rd Street, and the school was down, 53rd and 19th Avenue, and the school was down on 24th Avenue and, in Bensonhurst. 24th Avenue and what town was that? : 61st Street. McGLOIN: Yeah. 61st Street. LEVINE: Were there a lot of people who had come from Ireland living where you lived in Bensonhurst? McGLOIN: No, there was not. LEVINE: No. McGLOIN: (?) said, "What do you want to be moving out there for to that place?" LEVINE: Well, if you were to divide yourself between being Irish and being American, what aspects of you or what parts of you would you call Irish, and what parts of you would you call American? McGLOIN: What do you mean, what? LEVINE: I mean, what aspects or what qualities do you think you have that sort of put you in the Irish category or in the American category? McGLOIN: Well, I'm not that much in the Irish category because I didn't live in a neighborhood like that, and you learn to live with what you have. It was, the reason that he said to me, "What are you going out there for? They're all ginnys." And there wasn't. But I get along with every nationality. It's up to you, and up to your kids to do the same. My kids always got along with, you know, they were to my, back to my house when I was in Jersey, they were down there for weekends and, you know. LEVINE: Tell me the names of your children. McGLOIN: That's Tom. He's the oldest. And I have Maryanne, Regina, Noreen, Kevin. Is that them all? : That's it. LEVINE: How about grandchildren? Do you have grandchildren? McGLOIN: Please. I have twenty-four. LEVINE: Wow. McGLOIN: And I have three great-grandchildren, maybe more than three great-grandchildren. They're in Texas, they're in Arkansas, they're up in Maine, they're down in Florida, they're in Texas. You name it, they're there, gone. LEVINE: What, we just have a few minutes left, but I want to ask you, what do you feel most satisfied about that you've done in your life? McGLOIN: I think I have made a good life for myself. I'm always there willing to help people, and I would, you know, still do whatever I had in my sight, because, uh, when we were growing up and there was a big family of us, we helped neighbors, you know. And you just didn't say, "What do you want?" You know, you were taught to respect the elderly and that is lacking today very much in young children. LEVINE: Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to say before we close about coming to this country, or your life? McGLOIN: I'm glad I came here. I'm glad I'm living until now. It's time to give up. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Okay. Well, why don't we stop here. I want to thank you very much for a wonderful, interesting, delightful story. I've been talking to Mary Marguerita McGloin, and I'm here in her home in Staten Island. It's April 12, 1994, and this is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm signing off. McGLOIN: Good. Thank you.
