And, uh, when he, he was away, when we are away, he was away and we didn't have school, I didn't like it. I loved to go to school. Yeah. SIGRIST: Could your parents read and write? OLSEN: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: Both of them could. OLSEN: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: Did they try to teach the children before the children went to school, how to read? OLSEN: Right. The ABC's. SIGRIST: ABC's. OLSEN: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah. That's what we did. SIGRIST: Do any of your teachers stick out in your mind for any reason? OLSEN: Huh? SIGRIST: Do you remember any of the teachers that you had while you were in school in Norway? OLSEN: I had one teacher. ( she laughs ) Or two. SIGRIST: You had one, that whole time. OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: What do you remember about him? OLSEN: Oh, he was very nice. And he used to play some kind of, some kind of instrument that was laying on the, like a, almost like a violin, that was laying on the, that was laying on the table. He laid it on the table, a long thing. I don't know what you call it. I forgot the name of it. And he used to play that. And we used to send, every morning when they came into school, we had to sing a Christian song. And he played this thing. There was, there was, uh . . . SIGRIST: Do you remember that song that you had to sing every morning at the beginning of school? OLSEN: Yeah, some of them. SIGRIST: Could you sing that for us, too? OLSEN: Uh, I don't know. ( she coughs ) I forgot what song was that. ( she sings in Norwegian ) SIGRIST: Well, you had to sing every day, but it was a long time ago. OLSEN: It was a long time ago. SIGRIST: A long time ago. When you were growing up in Norway, what did you know about America? How did you think about America when you were a girl in Norway? OLSEN: I thought it was a big country. We thought it was great. We thought America was a big country, and it was a great country. And a lot of people that, if you went there to make money. Yeah, we thought America was great. SIGRIST: Did you, did you ever know anyone who had gone to America and come back to Norway? OLSEN: Well, uh, no, not when I was a, when my sister went. SIGRIST: She went before you went. OLSEN: She went long before I went. I was small. SIGRIST: Do you remember what year it was that she went? OLSEN: No, I don't remember what year that was. Well, she went first, yeah. SIGRIST: Where did she go when she came to America? OLSEN: She went to New York. SIGRIST: And what did she do when she got there? OLSEN: Well, she was in, working in the house there, doing things. SIGRIST: Doing domestic work? OLSEN: Huh? SIGRIST: Doing domestic work in a house? OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Serving work. OLSEN: Yeah, yeah, serving. And she loved it. SIGRIST: And what was she writing back to the family telling them? OLSEN: Oh, she thought it was great. "Oh, yeah," she said. "Everyone, after you get out to work," she said, "come to America." ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Why was it that you wanted to come to America? OLSEN: Because I wanted, I, I wanted to work in America. And my sister thought America was great, and she loved it. Both of my sisters went down there. SIGRIST: Before you did. OLSEN: Before I did. SIGRIST: Uh-huh. So they're both here and . . . OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Well, how did you, do you remember asking your parents if you could go to America? OLSEN: Uh, yeah. I felt I wanted to go. And . . . SIGRIST: And what was your father's reaction to this? OLSEN: Well, he, my sister and, my two sisters had made good in America, so he didn't say much about it. If I feeled like I wanted to go, okay. Uh-huh. SIGRIST: And tell me about what you had to do to get ready to leave Norway? OLSEN: Oh, I had to buy, I had to buy some clothes and things. SIGRIST: Do you remember the clothes that you bought? OLSEN: Oh, I don't remember. ( they laugh ) SIGRIST: Did you have to, um, did you have to have a medical exam before you left Norway? OLSEN: Uh, no. I don't think, I don't remember that. No? No. But you had to be healthy, I mean. SIGRIST: What about getting papers to leave Norway? OLSEN: They did that, uh, I tell you, they did that on the boat, or before you get on the boat. They examined you, or you have to be, when you come over here you have to be examined. You have to go into Ellis Island. SIGRIST: Right. Which we'll get to when we get you to Ellis Island. I was just wondering if you had to be examined before you left Norway, too. OLSEN: No, no. SIGRIST: So you didn't. OLSEN: No, no, you didn't. SIGRIST: Did your mother and your, did your stepmother and your father give you any kind of little goodbye party when you were getting ready to leave? OLSEN: What do you mean? SIGRIST: Well, just some kind of a little gathering to say goodbye to you. OLSEN: Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. We did, they got together with the family and most. SIGRIST: How did you feel . . . OLSEN: And somebody else, I know they were crying. I remember that. They said they feel sad about this. At the same time, you know, they feel sad about that, going over here. Because they missed, they wouldn't see them. They know they has to stay there. You know, so far away, you couldn't go back. In, at that time . . . SIGRIST: They were feeling sad because you were leaving. OLSEN: Right. SIGRIST: How did you feel? OLSEN: Yeah, well, I was feeling sad, too, (?) my parents, you know. I know I would see them, so I feel, that goodbye, that goodbye was unhappy. No, I remember that. I feel bad leaving my parents, and they feel bad seeing me go. But at the same time they thought of us best, it was better over here than it was in Norway. If you have to work, it was better to work in America than it was to work in Norway. You pay much more here, and things are so different here. Everything (?) there they told us was so beautiful. Precious, you know. SIGRIST: So they thought that even thought it was sad for them, they knew it was the best thing for you. OLSEN: Right, right, uh-huh. SIGRIST: Do you remember what you packed to take with you? What did you take with you from Norway? OLSEN: Oh, I took a, I didn't took too much, because my sister said, "You're gonna buy it much better and much nicer in America than you can in Norway." ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Did you take an object with you that would be a remembrance of Norway for you? OLSEN: Oh . . . SIGRIST: Like a Bible or something like that? OLSEN: Oh, yeah. The Bible, I took it. Yeah, oh, yeah. (?) And my father said, "Never tell a lie." ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Did you have to, were you bringing anything for your sisters in America? OLSEN: Uh, no. My sister was in America. For me, I was the youngest. I was the youngest out of those three sisters, and they had been here before. So they had a, they had, they come home to Norway. A lot of nice clothes and a lot of nice things. Oh, yeah. I thought it was beautiful. SIGRIST: So they didn't want anything. They didn't want anything for you to bring to them. OLSEN: No. SIGRIST: I thought maybe like some cheese or something, you know, bring them in America. OLSEN: No, no, no. SIGRIST: Where did you have to go to get on the big ship? OLSEN: We had to go to Christianson. SIGRIST: And how did you get from your town to there? OLSEN: Oh, by, by horse, horse and wagon. Yeah. SIGRIST: Now, it's 1914. You said the war had just started. OLSEN: Right. (?) war. SIGRIST: What do you remember about that? 'Cos that's all happening at the same time as you're getting ready to leave, isn't it? OLSEN: Well, the war had started, and Norway was in war. And I remember we got out on, I think it was Bergensfjord. The ship's name was Bergensfjord. SIGRIST: The Bergensfjord was the ship, yeah. OLSEN: So we got out there in the, in the middle of the ocean, Atlantic Ocean. And that big war ship stopped us. They stopped us. You have to stop the ship. And we were shaking, because this was so young and war ship. They stopped us. They stopped us. And we got called up on the deck, every, all the (?). Called them up on the deck. And we stood there. We saw that ship out there. And, uh, we were shaking, because we thought now they're going to sink us, they're going to sink us. And we didn't know what's going to happen. But we were lucky that we didn't get sunk. That ship didn't sink us. That was just the, I think that was just the beginning of the war. Yeah, yeah. It was just the beginning of the war. They couldn't have sunk us, that they didn't. And we were so happy. When we saw this, they went around. You know what they are looking for? (?) They know there must be passenger aboard. Passengers, they're not allowed to sink passengers. They wanted to see do we have any ammunition, and they came around and they went all around the place, and they didn't find anything, so they let us go. I never, I never forget those, those, that time we stood on the deck and didn't know whether we were going to go to the bottom, to the bottom of the Atlantic, or if we're gonna pass. They're letting us pass. They didn't find any ammunition on it. SIGRIST: I can tell just by listening to you . . . OLSEN: That's just a passenger boat. SIGRIST: I can tell just by listening to you . . . OLSEN: Huh? SIGRIST: I can tell just by listening to you the emotion that you still feel talking about it. OLSEN: Yeah. ( she laughs ) Yeah, I've been feeling. SIGRIST: It was scary. You know, that leads me to also ask you first the Titanic sunk just a couple of years before you went on the ship. OLSEN: Yes, Titanic, yeah. SIGRIST: When you got, when you got onto the Bergensfjord, how did you feel about getting on a big ship? OLSEN: Well, I didn't feel too good. I didn't feel too good, no. SIGRIST: Had you ever been on a big ship before? OLSEN: No, I'd never been on a big ship before. That was my first time, yeah. SIGRIST: Where did you sleep on the Bergensfjord? OLSEN: They had beds down, down below. Yeah. They had beds, four in a room. SIGRIST: Uh-huh. And . . . OLSEN: One on the top and one on the bottom on each side. And then every other place they had, you know. SIGRIST: And who was in your cabin with you? Who were the people traveling? What do you remember about them? OLSEN: Uh, well, they were Norwegian. I don't remember. I have trips I don't remember special, you know. SIGRIST: Were you traveling alone? You didn't have a chaperon or anything with you? OLSEN: No. SIGRIST: You were just by yourself, or was there someone traveling with you from, from home to the ship? OLSEN: Well, I think, I went with my sister. SIGRIST: Oh, your sister had come . . . OLSEN: Had come home. SIGRIST: Oh. OLSEN: And I went with . . . SIGRIST: I see. OLSEN: Because they say to me, "Well, if you have to work, the best place to work is in America. So I decided to go. They were home on a visit. And they told me . . . SIGRIST: Both of them? OLSEN: Yeah. They told me that. That's how I got here. SIGRIST: Oh, I didn't realize. Okay. So you're traveling with your sisters. OLSEN: I'm traveling with my sisters. SIGRIST: Are they in the cabin with you then? OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: All right. So it's, it's your two sisters and you and some other person. OLSEN: Yeah, four in all. SIGRIST: Does anything else about the voyage in the ocean stick out in your mind? You told us the story about the Germans stopping you. What else happened during that voyage that you can remember? OLSEN: Uh, I told you about the . . . SIGRIST: The Germans stopping the ship. OLSEN: Yeah. Uh, well, uh . . . SIGRIST: Did anything happen during . . . OLSEN: No, it didn't. We were scared that the ocean got so rough, you know. We were out, out there, out in the, on the Atlantic. They were big billows. They come rolling in on you. SIGRIST: Big billows. OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Big waves. OLSEN: Big waves, yeah. And then you think, oh, they're going to roll over the ship and we're going to sink. When you sit out on the deck and look at those big billows, you think they're going to swallow you up. Yeah. Then there is a time that the ocean is still, it's not like that. It's only in a storm. If you get out in a storm. It's very bad that a ship get out in a storm, because it might almost sink the ship. SIGRIST: Where did you spend most of the time on the ship? OLSEN: Oh, I spent most of the time, I think, out on the deck there. SIGRIST: Up on the deck. OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did you see anything unusual, other than the big waves, when you were up on the deck? Anything that made an impression? OLSEN: Well, if I saw a ship then, you know, then there was something, you know. We saw another ship, but that happened that we could meet another ship, we could see them say goodbye and things like that, but not very often. SIGRIST: How long . . . OLSEN: We only saw the ocean. SIGRIST: How long did the journey take on the . . . OLSEN: Oh, at that time it took eleven days. SIGRIST: Eleven days. OLSEN: And they used a (?), if you had, if you had, uh, this there leaning against you, then it took longer, yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty when the ship came into New York? OLSEN: Ah, I never forget that. ( she laughs ) I was up early to look for the Statue of Liberty, because they said that the Statue of Liberty was the first thing we saw of America would be Statue of Liberty. And we all went and looking, looking, looking for Statue of Liberty. Yeah. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: What did it feel like when you actually saw it? OLSEN: Oh, it feels good. Yeah, it feels good. Yeah. SIGRIST: And then what happened? After the ship came into the harbor . . . OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Then what was the next thing that happened? OLSEN: You had to go through Ellis Island. SIGRIST: To Ellis Island., OLSEN: Yeah. They took us over to Ellis Island. SIGRIST: How did you get over to Ellis Island? OLSEN: I think they took us by boat, yeah. SIGRIST: The same boat, or a different boat? OLSEN: No, I think it was a different boat, yeah, smaller. SIGRIST: And what do you remember about being at Ellis Island? OLSEN: I was scared. SIGRIST: Did you know what it was? OLSEN: Huh? SIGRIST: Did you know what it was that was going to happen to you at Ellis Island? OLSEN: No, I didn't know what's going to happen. They might refuse me and send me home, yeah. And, uh, they asked me a question there, (?). And if it was something, then they let me go. But, because, oh, well, they saw, they, uh, you couldn't come in if you were sick. They, uh, examined you, but that was just, they, they looked at your throat. I remember that. I thought I had to have some kind of examination, but I didn't have any (?). They said, "Just look at my throat. Open your mouth." I opened my mouth, and there was, they looked at my throat. But in my, my throat (?). So . . . SIGRIST: Did they examine anything else? OLSEN: No. SIGRIST: Other than your throat? That's . . . OLSEN: No, not that I can remember. SIGRIST: What did Ellis Island look like on the inside? OLSEN: Oh, I tell you, it was a pretty big place. I can hardly remember because they had done away with Ellis Island. You don't have to go to Ellis Island now. SIGRIST: No, not now, right. What about your sisters? Were they with you when you were at Ellis Island, or did, were they, did they have to go through all that, too? OLSEN: They had to go through that, too. Yeah, we all had to go through that. And we had to have a name and address over here to go to. You had to have, give that up, if you had a place to go to. SIGRIST: How long do you think you were at Ellis Island? OLSEN: Oh, I went pretty fast through there. But somebody was held, you know. If you're not well enough, I think you were held back. But not that, it didn't happen very often. SIGRIST: Did you eat anything at Ellis Island? OLSEN: No. SIGRIST: No. OLSEN: No. SIGRIST: Where did you go when you left Ellis Island? OLSEN: I went to my, uh, my, uh, some friends in Brooklyn. SIGRIST: In where? OLSEN: In Brooklyn. SIGRIST: Brooklyn. OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: And were your sisters with you? Did they go with you? OLSEN: Yeah. They went with me, yeah. SIGRIST: What did you think of New York City? You know, you came into New York off of Ellis Island. What did you think of all of this? OLSEN: I think it was big, was great. I thought it was great, what I saw. SIGRIST: Did you have to take a subway to Brooklyn? How did you get to Brooklyn? OLSEN: Um, yeah, no. Uh, we took a little boat. We had to get out that big boat that we were sailing on and get into another boat to go to Ellis Island. SIGRIST: Right. And then the little boat took you back to New York. OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: And then how did you get to Brooklyn? OLSEN: Oh, by subway. SIGRIST: Yes. Had you ever been on a subway before? OLSEN: No, I never been on a subway, no. SIGRIST: And what was that like, going to Brooklyn on the subway? What was it like to ride on the subway? OLSEN: Well, I thought it was great. I thought America was great. I must say that. SIGRIST: Did you get work? OLSEN: Yeah. SIGRIST: How long were you . . . OLSEN: Oh, it didn't take long. SIGRIST: And what kind of work did you get? OLSEN: Oh, I got, uh, housework, in the house, yeah. And I couldn't talk. ( she laughs ) How could they hire me? I couldn't understand one, one word of English. How could they hire me, and pay me for work? SIGRIST: How much did they pay you? OLSEN: Oh, I guess it was thirteen, fourteen dollars a month, that's all. But they did pay, and I didn't know one word of English. SIGRIST: How did you learn English? OLSEN: I learned it there, in, when I worked. SIGRIST: In the house. OLSEN: In the house. SIGRIST: What was your first word? OLSEN: Uh, oh, I can't remember. I can't remember what it was. Maybe it was cleaning, or something like that. ( they laugh ) SIGRIST: Did you miss Norway? How did you feel, when you were here, how did you think about Norway? OLSEN: Well, it was my, my, uh, birthplace, and, uh, I couldn't forget Norway. SIGRIST: Were you writing to your parents? OLSEN: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: Yes, and what were you telling them about America? OLSEN: Oh, I was telling them how great it was. I thought it was great, and I was great, too, for me. Yeah, I thought it was great. But it was hard to start with, because I couldn't understand and I couldn't, I couldn't understand English. They couldn't understand me, and I couldn't understand them. and they must have had to be patient, I think. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Were they, were they good with you, though? I mean, did they take the time to help you learn? OLSEN: Yes, they were good with me, yeah. I must say that. I have nothing to, they were good to me. And, uh, I got to places, I have a place, uh, there was only three people in the family, and they were all grown up. And, you know, they were loud most of the time, and I said my sister and I are never gonna learn English. There's nobody to talk to. SIGRIST: Could your sister speak English? OLSEN: Oh, yeah. They had learned it. So I said, I said, "I have to get a place with, uh, children." So I got the place with children, and children, you know how they talk all the time, and that's how I learn English. SIGRIST: Well, Mrs. Olsen, we need to end now. We've been talking for al whole hour now. ( they laugh ) But I want to thank you very much for letting me ask you these questions. You've got a great memory. You remember a lot. We're going way back, too. OLSEN: Yeah, we are going way back. SIGRIST: And I appreciate you singing for us, too. It was great. OLSEN: Huh? SIGRIST: I appreciate that you sang for us on tape, too.
