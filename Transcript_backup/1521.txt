MOORE: And what were her, you said she cooked for the family. Did she clean and do everything? SCHMIDT: Yes. Somebody helped her with the dishes and everything. We had a big kitchen. MOORE: Who helped her with the dishes? SCHMIDT: Oh, my younger brother, George. He always liked to work in the kitchen with her, so he was on the stove, too, and helped. MOORE: And is there a story about your mother from childhood that you remember? SCHMIDT: My mother? Well, she was a child like everybody else, you know. And I don't remember that because I wasn't old enough to remember her doings. MOORE: Yes. Okay. What about your brothers and sisters? How many brothers and sisters did you have? SCHMIDT: I had, I had three, four brothers, and I had about four sisters, too. MOORE: Do you remember their names? Could you tell me them in order? SCHMIDT: Yeah, I remember all the names. There is Barbara. MOORE: Was she the oldest? SCHMIDT: Yeah. She was very smart. MOORE: The oldest girl, huh? SCHMIDT: Yeah. And she studied, and she could, she was teaching in kindergarten, and then she, she was as good as the teacher. She was very good. And then was Anna. Well, Anna was very good in sewing. She worked for the dressmaker, and she was very good, and she was very good-natured and very nice personality, real nice, and very good-looking, too. MOORE: So there's Barbara and Anna, and who else? SCHMIDT: And Barbara, she was, uh-huh, yeah. There was my sister Victoria. Yeah. She was good-natured, but she wasn't, I wouldn't say, anything to rave about, you know. She, what she was, she was good, and then there was Anna. Of course, I told you about Anna. And there was Willie, Joseph, and then George. Yeah. And then Mathilde. Oh, Mathilde, she was quite a card, I'll tell you that. She was very smart, you know, but believe me, she had a mouthpiece. Nobody, nobody argued with her, you know, see, but she was very smart. She studied, too. And my brother Tony, he was the oldest. He was the oldest. And he was doing a lot of things. He always, but he didn't want to do what my father wanted him to do. So he was the oldest and I really don't remember what his later years and what he was doing, you know. MOORE: That's good, okay. What about your house back in Germany, in Bavaria? What do you remember about your house? SCHMIDT: My house? We had a nine-room house, four bedrooms upstairs, real nice. And each one had their bedroom. Of course, there were three of them, sometimes four, in one bedroom, but I had a bedroom of my own. MOORE: Why? SCHMIDT: Because I was the first one up in the morning because I had to milk seven cows, and so I had to get my sleep, you see? And they didn't, they didn't bother me much. I didn't touch anybody, but they know when I tell them this was boss and that was boss, that's all. And I said, "They can get up later and get more sleep." But I had to be up because the milkman came and picked up the milk in the can to deliver to the creamery at a certain time, and my milk had to be outside. MOORE: So you were given a lot of responsibility then, in the farm. SCHMIDT: Yes, yes. In fact, my father gave me all the responsibility from the farm. MOORE: Now, what about the boys? Were the boys . . . SCHMIDT: Well, they were, they were, then we had horses, and they had to haul things, you know. And they were doing odd things, you know. MOORE: So they trusted you very young, then? SCHMIDT: I did, I, my father trusted me mainly with the horses, because if you were careless those young horses did almost anything, you know, and you had to keep them in line. And I had to bring them in a certain time, and they had to be fed a certain time. And I always saw that they were fed and everything. MOORE: How old were you when you began doing this work at home? SCHMIDT: I was ten years old. MOORE: Ten years old. And then you milked the cows, too? SCHMIDT: Huh? MOORE: How old were you when you milked the cows? SCHMIDT: When I worked in the house? MOORE: The cows? SCHMIDT: Oh, the cows? I was, how old could I have been? I was taking care of horses. I wasn't older than maybe fifteen. MOORE: Uh-huh. Well, okay. Back to your house, what was your house made of? What was . . . SCHMIDT: It was a brick house. MOORE: A brick house. SCHMIDT: Yes. MOORE: And how was it heated? SCHMIDT: We had a, we had a furnace and that was, and then we had different heaters, you know. In the front there was a big wooden stove. I wouldn't say wooden, it was half iron or half, I mean, those combination stoves. MOORE: And what did you burn in those stoves? SCHMIDT: Uh, wood. MOORE: Wood, okay. And how was it lit? What lights did you have at that time? How did you light the house? SCHMIDT: Oh, very much. It was cozy and warm. MOORE: And how about, what did you use for lighting? SCHMIDT: Oh, we had electric, electricity. We had lamps here and there. ( she coughs ) MOORE: What about plumbing in your old house in Germany? SCHMIDT: Yeah, there was a plumbing, and there was in the kitchen running cold water. And hot water was piped in the stove, and . . . MOORE: How about the toilets? SCHMIDT: Oh, they were flushed off. We had outside . . . MOORE: Outside toilets? SCHMIDT: No. There was something like, it was big, where it was running into. MOORE: A sewer. SCHMIDT: Like a sewer, yeah. MOORE: Uh-huh. Now, how far was this house from town? SCHMIDT: Oh, it was not more than ten minutes. MOORE: By walking? Walking? SCHMIDT: I would say a little longer with walking, fifteen minutes or more, twenty. MOORE: And did you have a, did you have a garden? SCHMIDT: Yes, we had a big garden. MOORE: And what did you grow in your garden? SCHMIDT: In the garden? My mother, she was mainly responsible for the garden. We grew everything. ( she clears her throat ) We grew lettuce, and then kohlrabi and radish and beets and beans and, oh, cabbage, I guess. Almost everything. MOORE: And what about animals? Did you keep animals? SCHMIDT: Yes. We had cows, and amongst the cows there were some, some male. MOORE: Bulls? SCHMIDT: I'll tell you a little something about that. You don't have to write about it. We were feeding fresh clover, you know. And this was a little (?). And there was young cows, they were eating like crazy, you know. And then one, a couple of them, they got bloated, you know. And on the side of their stomach they got as big as a grapefruit, you know, that was full of gas, you know. And if we didn't take care of it they blew up, you see? And I was the one, had to get, I had a tube what I stuck in there and let the gas out and put a little pipe in there where the, where it can come out all the time until the animal was all right again, you know. Just like a doctor, see. MOORE: So you were given responsibility for that, too, with the cows. SCHMIDT: Yes, yes. Oh, yes. And if I didn't stick him, then they'd ( she makes an exploding noise ) and fall over, and then that's the end of them. And they were a good size, you know. But I was always, the person that had the guts to do something like that, you know. It's not easy to go and stick an animal, you know. And then, and the tooth comes right at you. But I did good every time, yeah. MOORE: And what about other animals? You had cows and you had horses. What else did you have? SCHMIDT: I had, they had to be milked. I used to milk them. MOORE: What about, did you have any other type of animals at all? SCHMIDT: Well, we had horses and cows and heifers, and then smaller ones, you know. One got out of the stable and run away, and it ran so much that it blew up, you know. ( she laughs ) They were, it was just, yeah. That's just an incident, yeah. MOORE: And what about, did you have chickens? SCHMIDT: Yes. MOORE: And did you have pigs? SCHMIDT: Yes. ( she laughs ) Oh, we had pigs. We had pigs. I remember seven of them. And she had two big stables all for herself, because she had a lot of young ones, you know. And, ah, but she was a monster, you come in, "Rooooh!" You know. Nobody would go in except me. Yeah. MOORE: And did you keep any other animals? Goats? SCHMIDT: Yeah. No goats. We didn't have any goats. Uh, chickens, and then, of course, dogs. And then those young heifers, they kept you busy. And we didn't have young horses, but one horse got sick once, and I had to examine him, and it had an infection. So I took care of it, and it was all right, you know. I tell you, they didn't have to call the veterinary. I took care of all those things. MOORE: Where did your grandparents live? SCHMIDT: My grandparents, oh. I tell you, I can really, they lived far away. I mean, I didn't see, the farm was away. I didn't have much connection, you know. And they, when I was so young, I mean, by the time I was old enough they probably died, you know. MOORE: And you said your mother did the cooking in the family. SCHMIDT: Oh, yes. MOORE: Did you ever help? SCHMIDT: Yeah, I helped, but not too much. I had a younger brother, George. He used to be Mother's helper, yeah. MOORE: And what was the kitchen like? Could you describe your kitchen? SCHMIDT: I had, we had a beautiful kitchen. It was all light brick, you know. And the floor, I mean, it wasn't plaster, it was . . . MOORE: Tile?

Nine of them can sit on there, so. And then there were benches around, and so. Most of the time they eat, we had a nice stove in there. That stove was, you could open the door and cook inside, too, you know. So we had a lot of baking. And my mother baked a lot of stuff, and then . . . MOORE: And what was your favorite food as a child? Do you remember? SCHMIDT: My favorite food? We had to eat everything. We didn't have to pick, you know what I mean. So, of course . . .

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." And . . . MOORE: Yeah. What about, how far away was the church from your house? SCHMIDT: Oh, we had a smaller church that was only about three, four blocks away from us, but we only had church once a week in there. And then we had to go to Osterbuchen [ph] Church. That's where we went to church and school, and that was every day, eight o'clock. MOORE: School? SCHMIDT: Huh? MOORE: School every day. SCHMIDT: And church. And then afterwards school. MOORE: I see. Okay. And what about, did you ever experience any religious persecution for being Catholic? SCHMIDT: Any persecution? MOORE: For being Catholic, at all? SCHMIDT: Oh, what means persecution?

Plow or run the horses, milk, anything what was there. I was afraid of nothing. They know, they could tell me anything. "She does it. Don't worry about her." So then I thought to myself, I was getting older, and then there was a lot of boys trying to hang around me. But I said, "I'll never marry anybody here. I'm not going to, I don't want to be a farmer's wife and put up with all that baloney here." I mean, do all the work what I had to do. Not that I didn't want to, and helped them out and all. But I was gotten to the age where there were some other ones coming up. And I said that's the only way to get away, you know, see. And I wanted to do something else. I didn't want to be a farmer, you know. MOORE: Did anyone influence you? Did anyone tell you you could do something else? SCHMIDT: No. MOORE: What about your teachers at school?

SCHMIDT: Well, I think I had some influence on my sisters, I mean, that they were living a different life, you know, see. And I thought, "Well, I don't want to be a farmer, you know." Not that I didn't like it, but I just liked to have a different living, you know. MOORE: Okay. So how did you then, what happened then? SCHMIDT: And, so I was writing to them, and I said if I couldn't come to America, and so forth. And, of course, my sister Betty, she was a very studious woman, you know, she was very smart, but she was never well in her life. She, they had a lot of time to raise her. I mean, she wasn't very well. But she was smart. And she wrote to me and encouraged me to come. And then . . . MOORE: Now, Annie and Betty were then now in the United States? SCHMIDT: That's right.

And I investigated, and I know I could get my papers together because I wasn't no dummy at that time, you know. And then I thought, "Well, I'll get things together and I'm going." Of course, everybody scared me to death, but I wasn't scared of nothing. MOORE: What did they say to you? SCHMIDT: Huh? MOORE: How did they scare you? SCHMIDT: Oh, I had to go by boat, and I tell you, it was something to be scared of, I tell you. MOORE: What did your father think when you told him you wanted to go to the United States?

SCHMIDT: Well, my mother, she liked my work at home real well, and she didn't kind of like me to go to America. So, but I thought, well, my sisters, they want me to be somebody else but a farmer. And I said, especially my older sister. So I said I'd better make up my mind that I'm going. And I had to get all kinds of papers together, and I had to finish school here, and then I had to oh, well, a certain amount of clothes, and . . . MOORE: Where did you get the money to come to the United States? SCHMIDT: Oh, my parents. They, you know, they took money in on the farm. So later on I paid them all back. MOORE: So where, when did you leave? How old were you when you left? SCHMIDT: Nineteen. MOORE: And did they give you a party before you left? Do you remember, did they give you a dinner or anything? SCHMIDT: No. You know, I was, we were farm people, and we weren't socializing so much, you know. Too much parties, and so. So you got an ice cream or something for dessert and everything, well, but there wasn't so many kids in my class. So that's all right. We, I had a lot of friends, you know, but then . . . MOORE: What did you pack? What did you put in your suitcase to come here? SCHMIDT: Oh, my suitcase? My everyday clothes, underwear. I had nice clothes. MOORE: Did you take anything special from the family with you? SCHMIDT: No. FEMALE VOICE OFF MIKE: Your feathers. SCHMIDT: Huh? FEMALE VOICE OFF MIKE: Your feathers. SCHMIDT: Oh, yeah.

MOORE: So why did you . . . SCHMIDT: We had some geese, too. We had thirty geese. And they were not easy to be plucked, you know. The chickens you can't pluck very good, but you can pluck, I mean, the geese. Yeah, I plucked the geese. MOORE: And so you brought feathers with you. Why? SCHMIDT: Well, because they didn't have any feathers in America. I was used to a feather bed, yeah. MOORE: So you brought your own feather bed. SCHMIDT: You bet. MOORE: ( she laughs ) Okay.

Not to her, but in the back there was a house. Then I moved someplace else. And then she made up her mind I should be living out there and, you know, I mean, just to pack, I was in business and I sold out and I raised three kids. And they all, two of them went to college. And, well, Fred, the big man, he didn't, he was a very smart guy, and he said, "I don't need college," he says. And . . . MOORE: Well, let's back up a bit. We haven't gotten you to your children yet. We're still in Germany now, you're leaving. Okay? So you're leaving Germany, and how did you get from your house to the port? What port did you leave from? SCHMIDT: You know, they took me to a train, or to whatever I had to go to. We had a real nice coach, where I used to go and get people when they come by train, and haul them home. I was the town chauffeur, you see? And it worked fine. And so I was still the town chauffeur. So there was no problem there. And . . . MOORE: So when you left, they took you in the same coach? SCHMIDT: Yes. MOORE: Did you drive? SCHMIDT: No. Somebody else drove. MOORE: And this time you rode to the station. SCHMIDT: Yeah. I had a trunk. It was made out of wood, you know.

And did you have to wait for the boat overnight? SCHMIDT: Uh, it was, arrangements were made when my boat was going to leave. That's what I was going to meet, and that worked all good. MOORE: Did you travel alone? SCHMIDT: Yeah. MOORE: You were alone. SCHMIDT: Yes. MOORE: And do you remember seeing the boat for the first time? SCHMIDT: You bet I do. MOORE: And what was it like? SCHMIDT: Oh, I haven't got any boats here that I can see, yeah. It was a big boat, a very big boat, yeah. MOORE: And what kind of accommodations? What did you have? SCHMIDT: There were some, there were people, I would say, in the upper deck, and not all the way up, just, and then below, you know. And so, ( she pauses ) I wasn't, I had a bed of my own, and then, yeah. MOORE: You had a bed of your own, but were there other people in your room with you?

But, you know, I was in, I was in the, I said to myself, "I don't care if it goes down, then I go bye-bye. That's all right." I didn't care what happened to me it was so bad. I tell you, it was terrible. MOORE: Were you sick? SCHMIDT: You bet I was sick. I couldn't eat much, and you had to watch when you walked you would fall right on the floor. MOORE: Did you make any friends in the boat that could help you? SCHMIDT: Not when you were in that condition, no. MOORE: And did you ever go on deck? SCHMIDT: I went on deck the minute the boat stopped. I went on deck, and I was on deck every day. I was walking and walking and walking. I couldn't wait to get out and get going. And . . . MOORE: Did you eat anything during this time? SCHMIDT: Well, while I was sick I wasn't eating. What went down came right up. And they didn't give you much. I don't remember what they all fed us. MOORE: Did you have a dining room to eat in? SCHMIDT: Well, we had a dining room and everything, but I never made to it. I never made it from my bedroom. If it was, you know.

But I only see Ellis Island, I only see in, people like me walking around, you know, and getting on their feet. But when you were on the boat and you tried to land, you don't see much. I mean, you only go through personalities, but in the (?) take your history and everything. And then I saw my relatives and all. They were trying to help me. MOORE: Did you have any medical examination? SCHMIDT: Not that I know of. I wasn't, I wasn't in shape to be, well, I wasn't feeling well, but I wasn't sick that much. MOORE: Did you have a medical examination in Germany before you left, by a doctor? SCHMIDT: Oh, yes, oh, yes. MOORE: And what did they do in the examination? SCHMIDT: Oh, not much. I mean, they said I was okay. MOORE: And you had all the papers . . . SCHMIDT: Oh, yes. MOORE: . . . with you. And when you went to Ellis Island, what do you remember about Ellis Island? What it looked like, the buildings? Do you remember? SCHMIDT: Well, of course, you only went from the boat to the deck, you know. And then you walked, and they were feeding you something, you know. And then we never ate anything practically for, I was ten days on the boat. MOORE: And the trip from . . . SCHMIDT: Yes, yes. And you were so hungry, and you ate whatever came along. But then . . .

SCHMIDT: My two sisters. MOORE: Came to get you. SCHMIDT: Yes. MOORE: And did you stay on Ellis Island overnight? SCHMIDT: No. I didn't stay. They took me that day, and then my sister Annie took me home. MOORE: And where was home? SCHMIDT: Well, she was working for people. MOORE: In New York? SCHMIDT: Yeah, in, close to Ellis Island. And they were really helping her, too, because they were, they came from Munich and they, they knew what it was like. So they were nice. They were nice to them later on. So, anyway. ( she pauses ) I went home, my sister Annie. She's always the person, you don't have to worry. She puts you on the, and then I had a, I had a good bed to sleep in, she made me breakfast.
