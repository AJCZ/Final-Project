FINE: [Interrupts] Isak. Isak. He was…

GEORGE: Isak, Isak remained in Russia because he was not living at home with us he was in the Russian army at the time so he chose to stay in Moscow in that area. We were in Latvia. We were living in Latvia. 

INTERVIEWER: Okay.

GEORGE: See we lived in Latvia, born in Latvia and that’s where we lived but our brother was in the Russian army and at the time he was stationed in Moscow, so and also there was an older sister was with him.

FINE: Yes. We’re the two youngest, yes. 

GEORGE: So everybody above us is gone.

INTERVIEWER: Oh. Yeah, uh huh.

FINE: Yeah so we are all here to tell you.

INTERVIEWER: Okay. When you think back to your life in Latvia and you remember your mother. What memories do you have?

FINE: My mother was a hardworking woman. She used to bake; she used to sell the stuff. She would bake goods; she used to bake stuff like breads and all that stuff—hardworking woman.

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. 

FINE: My father when he was alive he was a carpenter.

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. Did he build houses?

GEORGE: No, no

FINE: No, no, just for…

INTERVIEWER: Fixing things.

FINE: Fixing yes.

GEORGE: Just general carpentry.

FINE: Yeah.

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. Do you remember any times where you went places with your mother or father?

FINE: No.

GEORGE: No we didn’t travel too much. I think it was hard times.

INTERVIEWER: I mean like maybe to the market or just locally?

GEORGE: Well that…not I much because I was the youngest, but you know, we had our older siblings…

FINE: No we…It was a different way of living.

GEORGE: You know it’s a real country…its country. You know you didn’t live with houses on top of each other, you know had the house, the next house, and your neighbor had to be a block away you know so it was uh…

INTERVIEWER: What do you remember about it, if you could describe as much as possible what it was like living in that small town?

GEORGE: Well it was hard. We…I remember during World War…

INTERVIEWER: …One. 

GEORGE: One. Our town was beseeched and would have been kept by the Germans and Tillie and I were at the time in Hebrew school. You remember that do you?

FINE: No.

GEORGE: Yep, well. See she doesn’t remember. I’m younger but she doesn’t remember. 

FINE: Well…[mumbles]

GEORGE: I remember that because not only was our town bombed but we lived near a bridge not very far from a bridge near a river. And they came around and told us to cover our strips of paper across our windows, crisscross, in the event of an air attack so the glass wouldn’t shatter, and then the bridge was mined…if anyone got near the bridge…they were going to blow it up. We were living fairly close to that bridge, so I remember that, and also remember when we were in Hebrew school when the Germans attacked, and captured our town, and so we couldn’t go home until oh way at the end of the day, until we were going on our way home, this I remember, the big craters from the bombs that fell onto town.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember people? Do you remember like your Hebrew teacher or the other children?

GEORGE: Let’s see. The Hebrew teacher was an old man with a big beard. We used to go to his house. 

INTERVIEWER: Oh how many children?

GEORGE: We went to his house for lessons. Oh I don’t know how many he had but not many.

FINE: No.

GEORGE: And then of course another thing that I remember is the America YMCA had a branch there and they were living in a house at the head of our street. Do you remember that?

FINE: No.

GEORGE: No well anyway. I remember them and what impressed me about them was that they used to play baseball with a hard ball and use a glove to catch it and that was strange to us because we used the rubber balls. And we had many programs in our town and we were always saved by the Germans, not the Germans, the embassy. The embassy would not permit anybody to get to our street when the pogrom started but I guess the Russians who…what do you call them?…we had a name for them. The Kazaks. When they had them…rioting…nothing but a riot. What’s a pogrom? It’s a riot. They would stand across the street and wouldn’t let them enter, and they wouldn’t fight with them fight naturally, they were Americans.

INTERVIEWER: This is the American embassy?

GEORGE: Yes. Not embassy, the YMCA. We used to call it [Yimka] YMCA I remember that vividly, and so we were spared but sometimes we had to our leave our house during pogroms. 

INTERVIEWER: And what would you do?

GEORGE: And hide...Run out and hide in the forest, you know or the country somewhere. It never…a pogrom never lasted for days, hours, it was a riot, hit and miss, and then when all was clear, we’d come back.  

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any of that Tillie?

FINE: No I just remember like he used to kill people I mean they’d used to hide them in homes, but nothing else really. I don’t really remember see.

GEORGE: Another incident during World War I when the Germans occupied our town, the Russians were retreating and they passed our house, so then a group or a squad of soldiers and they left about a…must have been a five gallon glass…jug of vodka, and told us not to touch it and they would come back and pick it up and we such a hard time keeping that downstairs in our cellar. 

FINE: Yeah. 
GEORGE: Because my mother and Rose would say “whatever we do don’t go near that, if it breaks and they come here and find out its broken then there will be hell to pay, literally.” So I remember that but I don’t remember what happened to the vodka. I don’t think they ever came back for it.  

FINE: No. 

GEORGE: Of course these are things that pop up in my mind.

INTERVIEWER: Yeah, wonderful, wonderful. Was this a community of all Jewish people?

GEORG FINE: No, no, no we didn’t have a ghetto. 

FINE: Mixed. Mixed. Mixed.

GEORGE: We didn’t have a ghetto, no.

FINE: Mixed. Mixed. 

GEORGE: It was mixed. In fact we had a lot of Jewish people there we had Easter, Pesach, you know Easter, our Easter. We used to have a community matzo bake.

FINE: Yes that’s right. Used to go to a big bakery and take the matzo, roll the matzo, and bake it, yes. 

GEORGE: [Speaking softly over Tillie] That’s right do you remember that? The uh…

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember that?

FINE: That I remember yes.

INTERVIEWER: Tell whatever else you remember?

FINE: Well I remember I used to help them bake and nothing else really. I don’t know…you forget, you forget. 

GEORGE: Well I remember more than she does, I think. Because I remember…

FINE: You know a lot more; you’re smarter.

GEORGE: I remember my two brothers working there, and I don’t remember you but maybe you did, you know. 

FINE: Kind of…no. 

GEORGE: But my job was you know when you…are you familiar with matzo?

INTERVIEWER: Yes.

GEORGE: Well you know the little holes. Well they rigged up a little around… a reel…the…what do you call it? There’s a name for it. Its got points on it?

INTERIVEWER: Oh I think I know what you mean; it turns and it has like spokes sticking out?

GEORGE: Spokes. Exactly, a spoke wheel, a small one—they reel it up on a stick and my job was after whoever rolled out the dough for the matzo, I would come out the smoke stick and make the hole. 

FINE: Yes we had no machines to bake them—make the matzo.

GEORGE: We did it by hand, and we used to bake enough for the whole Jewish community.

INTERVIEWER: How did you feel? I mean what was…how did that feel like?

GEORGE: Who remembers? I don’t know, I just thought I was helping, you know. I was part of the crowd. I think that amounts to me being part of the crowd.

INTERVIEWER: Now were your mother and father present when this was happening?

GEORGE: No.

FINE: My mother was. 

GEORGE: Maybe mom was come again?  I don’t remember my father too much I only remember when he died.

FINE: My father died when we were younger.

GEORGE: Very young.

INTERVIWER: But do you remember that?

GEORGE: Yeah, I remember yeah.

INTERVIEWER: What do you remember about that?

GEORGE: Lets see. I remember that we used to sleep on the floor in the house, and we had a basement but the basement was a trapdoor with a great ring on it to lift the door up, and we slept near there and I think my father wasn’t feeling well; he was sick man, 

FINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: And he got up for one reason or another and walking past us he tripped…

TILLE FINE: He fell. 

GEORGE: he fell and hit his head. 

FINE: Yeah, that’s right. 

GEORGE: Yeah his scalp.

INTERVIEWER: His temple uh huh. 

GEORGE: And he must have messed up his brain…his scalp and brain and that’s why he died. He died now that I think about it two or three days later. I remember. 

FINE: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: How was the funeral handled? Do you remember anything about that?

GEORGE: Now that part I don’t remember. Isn’t that funny? I remember my mother’s funeral but she died when I was twelve and a half. 

TILLE FINE: And she died in this country. 

INTERVIEWER: But do you remember any other like rituals or ways of either religious observance?

GEORGE: Oh yeah we observed, we observed.

FINE: Oh yeah we had…

INTERVIEWER: Anything different in Latvia than the way it’s done here?

GEORGE: Of course different because we used to cook our Chametz meal on Friday you know before sundown and then it would stay in the oven all night, the chalet…

TILLE FINE: That’s right. We didn’t cook on Chametz. 

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm. What kinds of food do you recall from then?

FINE: Well lots of things. I mean…

GEORGE: Potato pancakes—my favorite, still is my favorite.

TILLE FINE: Potato pancakes. We used to bake [Unintelligible: 0:15:30] for Chametz. 

GEORGE: Oh yes. 

TILLE FINE: We used to make that. We used to cook like a …we used to have this hot oven that you could cook and leave it over night, and we used to bake in there, bake bread. My mother’s a baker; she used to bake…my mother used to bake…in fact she used to be a baker in the [Unintelligible: 0:15:49] and sell baked goods… she used to sell this stuff…yes.

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any of the dishes that your mother made that you particularly like?

GEORGE: She used to make [puchat].

TILLE FINE: My mother was… 

GEORGE: You know what that is?

INTERVIEWER: How do you spell puchat?

GEORGE: Well that’s I don’t know how. That’s…

FINE: That’s like to make the…to take…then you chill the stuff you cook it and then you chill the stuff…it’s like a Jell-O.

GEORGE: It’s from cow’s hooves.

FINE: Yeah, it’s the cow’s feet, yeah. 

GEORGE: We used to put hard-boiled eggs in it and slice it up. 

INTERVIEWER: [Interrupts] And how was that…

GEORGE: She used to make good gefilte fish.

FINE: That’s right. We used to…old fashioned way like you know you make carrots and sweet potatoes but we never had no sweet potatoes so we used to use regular potatoes and put meat in there and that would be a meal. 

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh.

FINE: Gefilte fish you know that was…we used to have fresh fish and take the meat off and then chop it up. 

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh.

FINE: So a lot of different ways—herring a lot herring [laughs].

INTERVIEWER: Did you help your mother with cooking?

FINE: Yes. 

INTERVIEWER: In the house?

FINE: Yes, I used to help, yes. I used to help, cook, clean, you know. I used to wash clothes and I used to go to a lake and wash clothes.

GEORGE: That’s right in the river. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember washing? 

FINE: Yes, yes. We couldn’t wash clothes in the house. We had to go the lake and wash the clothes. We used to have a heavy stick like and used to bang on… 

GEORGE: [Interrupts] beat the clothes up. 

TILLE FINE: Beat the clothes up, wash it, and then and rinse it out, and that’s how we used to dry it outside on the grass or something, yes.

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh. Did you go…would it be a social occasion? In other words would there be a lot of women there…

GEORGE: Oh no.

INTERVIEWER:…cleaning their clothes at the same time?

FINE: No, no everybody used to different days yeah, different days, no special day but we used to observe Shavuot that was a holy day.

INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh and were you a particularly religious family would you say?

FINE: Well we kept up the holidays. 

GEORGE: No…well we were…we were orthodox. 

FINE: Yes we kept up the religion. 

GEORGE: We were orthodox. We knew no other. We knew no other. You know Shavuot was Shavuot, and no matter what the…well now it’s what? Religious reform? The ultra…

FINE: Its different.

INTERVIEWER: Everybody who was…

GEORGE: Creates a different religion in America anyways. 

INTERVIEWER: Yeah, but there everybody who was Jewish was orthodox?

GEORGE: Right, right. I knew others now maybe if she could…years after we left… 

FINE: [Interrupts] Well things changed like…

GEORGE: But I got to explain something to you about the house. 

INTERVIEWER: Well let me take this because it’s going to pick that up. 

GEORGE: We thought about…when we talk about the cooking for the Shavuot. 

INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

GEORGE: We used to have a big oven, and in Europe houses had ovens. 

INTERVIEWER: Well describe the ovens.

GEORGE: Ovens. We used to heat them with wood…with wood, and the oven all the cooking and baking was done in these ovens. They were big, big oven hearths in the house and ours had the little space between the end of the oven and the wall where you could walk in, and then there was a shelf on top of the oven, and we used to sleep there sometimes in the wintertime when it was real cold. It was where the heat came through and there was two or three of us…

FINE: [Interrupts] That’s right to keep warm, that’s right.

GEORGE: You remember that?

INTERVIEWER: How big was it?

GEORGE: [Speaking over each other] Oh it was big. 

FINE: Oh it was like a couch, you know.

GEORGE: You know you go into a bakery today who has an oven—its small but its very effective because they use electricity, its you know electrically and mechanically. This was a big hearth. 

INTERVIEWER: You mean the oven was…what was the oven made out of?

GEORGE: Stone. It was built from stone.

INTERVIEWER: Uh-uh.

FINE: Brick, yes. 

GEORGE: Bricks and stone. That’s the only thing you have keeping you…now there’s no steam heat [laughs] there’s no furnace to put coal in it; you didn’t have coal in furnaces. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you have…did you grow any food?

FINE: No.

INTERVIEWER: Or did you have any animals?

FINE: No, no. We had no animals no. 

GEORGE: We didn’t grow food but we had access to vegetables, fruit; we could go to orchards.

FINE: Yes.

GEORGE: People who had orchards had small gardens. Sometimes the farmers would pass the house, passing by our house on a Saturday morning with their wagons loaded with bags of…

FINE: [Interrupts] Like what they call a peddler here, you know like…yeah. 

GEORGE: And at the market of course we were mischievous; we’d go… we would go back with a little wagon and cut a hole in one of the bags, and take out a few apples and potatoes, and bring it home and that was it. [Laughs] Sometimes they chased. But there was no refrigeration so everything was fresh. You had to have everything fresh every day. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember any other things you did for fun?

GEORGE: Oh yes we played stickball.

INTERVIEWER: Oh.

GEORGE: Yeah, played a lot of stickball.

INTERVIEWER: The same way they play it over here?

FINE: Well its much better here. It’s much better here. 

GEORGE: Well the memories…

GEORGE: Hardship.

INTERVIEWER: Hardship mm-hmm. Do you remember that too?

FINE: We used to go like wash clothes, we used to go to a lake like to wash clothes and take big soap out of it then rinse it. Then we used to dry it on the grass and put it out on the grass to dry it. Yeah. 

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.

GEORGE: It’s hard to remember. 

FINE: It’s so hard to remember it’s a long time you know. It’s a long time to remember all of these things. We want to remember good things now.

INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah. Well you remember going swimming?

GEORGE: Oh yeah, oh! 

INTERVIEWER: Where did you go?

GEORGE: In the river. You swam. You used to run down and take your pants off and go swim.

FINE: Yes. 

GEORGE: Never wore anything. 

FINE: Not bathing, naked. 

GEORGE: I used to…so I don’t remember vaguely from talking but sometimes the guys would say let’s sneak up and watch where the women were swimming or something. But uh…it wasn’t too much of that. I think it was more talk than anything else…

FINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: But uh we were active.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember why it was that your family decided to come to America?

FINE: Well…

GEORGE: Hardship.

FINE: Hardship we all like sister… like I said my brother and a lot of cousins and aunts in Providence, Rhode Island, and they were on my mother’s side.

INTERIVWER: This was a brother and sister on your mother’s side?

GEORGE: No, no. 

INTERVIEWER: Or your brother and sister?

FINE: No ours. They were here already yes, and then all our family—they all got together and that’s how we got to this country because they all got together and scraped the money together, and made enough money to send to our family. That’s how we got here. 

GEORGE: After World War I, things got very hard for us, especially being Jews was difficult and when my sister came over here…I don’t know what year she came here but I wasn’t…see I was born after she came to the United States—my oldest sister.

INTERVIEWER: Is this Rose?

GEORGE: Rose, right.  But when she went—when that whole family came—some brothers and my father—my father was very stubborn he didn’t want to leave Russia.

INTERVIEWER: Why didn’t he want to?

GEORGE: Well he was a carpenter; he was doing well and my mother was running a bakeshop, and he says he doesn’t want to go anywhere—this is the story I get. I don’t remember

INTERVIEWER: Right

GEORGE: And that’s why we were the only ones left and after World War I it became very difficult for us with the pogroms, and it was hard to live. We were really pauperis and the sister that was here, and then there was my father’s two brothers… and my mother’s two sisters.

FINE: Sisters yes.

GEORGE: Were here. They were all here, all went, all left. We were the only ones that didn’t go because my father didn’t want to leave and so…

FINE: So they got together and they sent for us. That’s how we came to this country. 

GEORGE: And they sent us our fare tickets and we came over in steerage.

INTERVIEWER: [Interrupts] Now who was traveling? Who was traveling with you?

GEORGE: Okay.

FINE: My mother. 

GEORGE: Our mother, two brothers Harry and Philip, my sister Tillie and I.

INTERVEIER: Do you recall…

GEORGE: [Interrupts] Oh tremendous.

INTERVIEWER: To leave?

GEORGE: Oh tremendous, the anxiety. The excitement. Our neighbors fixed us baskets of food to take on the train.

FINE: And the clothes we packed we took pillows, blankets, and we took…we traveled with some blankets and the feather pillows and all of that.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember anything else your mother packed?

FINE: I know she packed some homemade jelly, and right going on the boat the jar of jelly broke, and my mother’s a good cook. She’s a good cook, see. That broke and you took that…you know you don’t know you take it and not realize its not the thing you have to take, but you took that, and I tell you it’s a lot to talk about.

INTERVIEWER: And when you were leaving, do your remember did people gather to see you off or how did that…?

FINE: No, not exactly. I don’t remember that. 

GEORGE: I don’t remember that. But you know I see movies where people are moving and the neighbors come in, that’s all definitely news to me, new to me. I don’t remember getting—you know you want to know if we got a big send off. I’m sure that there are some people who envied us.

FINE: That’s just…

GEORGE: As we were getting out because you see we had a place to go and they remained.

INTERVIEWER: Had many people from your little town come to America before you?

FINE: Not that…I don’t know. I don’t remember that.

GEORGE: That I don’t remember 

FINE: No, not too many.

GEORGE: Isn’t that funny?

INTERVIEWER: Did you have any idea of what America would be like? I mean well I know your children…

GEORGE: [Interrupts] Well…Garden of Eden. That’s a fact. Garden of Eden—we are coming to America. I have no regrets.

FINE: No we are happy we are happy that we are. 

INTERVIEWER: Now when you left what did you take? What kind of transportation did you take and where did you go first before you got to the port?

GEORGE: Well.

FINE: Well the family, they were the ones that sponsored us to get there. But we went to our sister’s house.

GEORGE: No that’s coming here, now she wants…

FINE: No, going there.

GEORGE: We went by train from Riga. 

INTERVIEWER: Oh so how did you get…?

GEORGE: No from Rezekne we got by train to Riga, and then from Riga we went by ship to the port of Bilbao, I think. 

FINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: And then we went to Hamburg because in Hamburg, Germany and I remember the Germans being very strict. Oh!

INTERVIEWER: What incidents do you remember?

GEORGE: Well I remember for the least of an infraction…if you dropped a piece of paper or something, it was hell to pay. They were very strict about cleanliness and of course I guess they didn’t like Jews anyway so [Laughs] we were there, coming over and that was sort of a short stop because what we were heading for was Liverpool. And that was our port embarkation to America.

FINE: Yes.

INTERVIEWER: And how did you get from Hamburg there to Liverpool?

GEORGE: Well we went from Riga we went by small boat to Hamburg. 

FINE: I think by small boat. 

GEORGE: Yes. Its a little hazy how we got there, but I know that we took a small boat from the port of Riga to go to Hamburg, and in Hamburg I don’t know how we got from Hamburg to England. It had to be by ship—had to be a ship of some kind. 

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember Liverpool? Did you stay there for any length of time?

GEORGE: Yes. Liverpool I think we stayed one of two nights maybe but it was nice. Oh yeah, good food; it was clean, oh it was wonderful.

INTERVIEWER: You stayed in a hotel?

GEORGE: That I can’t remember where we stayed. 

FINE: I don’t know.

GEORGE: Do you remember?

FINE: You would know more than I do. 

GEORGE: I don’t know where we stayed. I do remember it could have been a hotel or a big building of some kind. But I remember of course I was very impressed by the good food [laughs].

FINE: It was…either we had to stay or we didn’t know they just…the rest of the crowd that traveled got that way. They all stayed…everybody had to stay together.

GEORGE: [Interrupts] Yeah everybody. I don’t know how big our party was at the time.

INTERVIEWER: Did…when you left Rez…

GEORGE: Rezekne.

INTERVIEWER: Rezekne. Did you travel with other people from the town?

GEROGE FINE: No.

INTERVIEWER: With just the family?

FINE: No. Just the family. With just the family. 

GEORGE: You know as you travel…groups would come…

FINE: You get acquainted.

GEORGE: Traveling in the same place you get acquainted but I remember very little of that. The only thing I remember after that was a very hectic crossing of the ship. The boat…see the boat we took was a small ship—wasn’t big. We were supposed to take a bigger boat but for some reason we either missed it by a few days or it was late and we had some bad storms.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the voyage?

GEORGE: Yes, the voyage was very difficult because we were in steerage.

INTERVIEWER: Describe steerage.

GEORGE: Steerage. Steerage is what you show here in your films.

INTERVIEWER: How is it in your experience? The same thing?

GEORGE: The same thing.  In fact we stop in some port and they were unloading. They were carrying a lot of something and it looked to me like something to eat—nuts or raisins I don’t know. 

FINE: Well they fed us … they fed us with herring…a lot of on the herring on the boat. A lot of herring. 

GEORGE: I remember watching them load this and once in a while a bag would break and stuff would come down so one day I got a lot of string tied together with a little something at the end of it, and loaded that down and the guys loaded it up so I could bring it up, but what they did is they pulled the rope away from me [laughs].

FINE: See I don’t know it. I don’t remember it.

GEORGE: The trip was very difficult as I say. It was steerage it slept like…

FINE: It took us a long time to get to…it was like a couple of weeks.

GEORGE: We were on the boat a long time, and I remember one particular storm was really bad. We were playing football on the deck and I almost fell off on the side of the deck and some guy grabbed me from my feet, and see these are things I remember. But so we arrived at Ellis Island and that was it.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember when the boat came into the New York Harbor?

GEORGE: Oh yes.

FINE: Oh yes. 

INTERVIEWER: What was that like for you? 

FINE: It was happiness. It was really… everybody was happy, yes. 

INTERVIEWER: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?

GEORGE & FINE [Speak simultaneously]: Oh yes. 

GEORGE: Oh yes. That was a big thrill…a big thrill. I remember you know, we came—my sister and brother who were instrumental in bringing us over…they lived in Coney Island, and that’s where we came…we stayed so I remember when the ship came through and I could see the homes and there were people. It was very exciting.

INTERVIEWER: Do you...what was your impression of Ellis Island?

GEORGE: Very bad.

FINE: Well I don’t remember seeing all these buildings. It was just like one room we were going in and out, and that’s it. We were like locked in, you know. It was not…there was no freedom. Everybody had to be together like…there was no freedom to get around. 

GEORGE: It took us a long time to get off the island, yeah for some reason. 

INTERVIEWER: Why was that?

GEORGE: I don’t remember which one but one of us was sick—had a rash of some kind. I think maybe they found something in my scalp.  I don’t remember. I remember something—in my mind. 

FINE: And then they kept us back for about few days. 

GEORGE: They kept us back because in fact they said that they don’t clear it up, you have to go back. 

FINE: They say you have to go back because you had to go to quarantine you know. 

GEORGE: Yeah but we stayed I don’t know how long, but I know that my sister and brother-in-law were very upset because there they are waiting for us to come off the boat, and it took a little while but we obviously…we made it [laughs].

INTERVIEWER: Now you had the rash, so did you go to the hospital?

FINE: No, no just stayed longer. Just stayed longer. 

GEORGE: No for some reason they kept us longer, and we really for a while there we were worried about it. 

INTERVIEWER: So they were watching the rash to see what it was. 

GEORGE: Yeah.

FINE: Yeah and that’s it otherwise they didn’t take us to the hospital or anything they just kept us a little longer.

GEORGE: And I remember the first trip to my sister’s house. 

INTERVIEWER: Before we leave Ellis Island do you remember anything about the food, the accommodations… 

FINE: [Interrupts] Well they gave…

INTERVIEWER: … how you were treated by the staff?

FINE: Oh they gave us food. They gave us a lot of herring and bread and nothing fancy just something… 

GEORGE: You know when…

FINE: You don’t know because you’re hungry and you ate whatever they gave you, and you were happy with that. We were happy with that. We didn’t expect…

GEORGE: In steerage…you know it’s a bad experience and for some reason and I’m not going to say I remember for sure, but for some reason I think it carried over onto the island here when we got off the ship here. You know the way the crowds were…you know those were very busy years with aliens coming in, and I remember that we were on the street but maybe if I was...if we were. I was expecting…ten years old [laughs] I’m America and things are supposed to be good in America. I guess that’s a child’s thinking.

INTERVIEWER: In other worlds it felt like an extension of the ship experience? 

GEORGE: Right. Exactly. 

INTERVIEWER: And it wasn’t. 

GEORGE: Yes, it’s a mixed feeling, but I’ll tell you I don’t regret it. I’m a proud American.

INTERVIEWER: Well now tell me what happened when your brother-in-law and sister actually came and met you?

FINE: Well they said…

INTERVIEWER: What was it like to see them again?

GEORGE: I never saw them! 

INTERVIEWER: You didn’t remember them?

GEORGE: No!

INTERVIEWER: Did you remember them?

GEORGE: No! My sister never saw me!

TILLE FINE: My sister I can remember that she was…

GEORGE: We didn’t know our brother-in-law because you know but my sister didn’t know me because I wasn’t born…

FINE: No, none of us knew because she left when we were younger children—and she you know…we didn’t know her until we came to America.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember your mother and her reaction to greeting you?

FINE: Oh my mother. Oh my mother she was thrilled. She only lived here two years and then she passed away. Yeah my mother was very happy to see the family. 

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh so what did you do? They met you?

TILLE FINE: They met us.

INTERVIEWER: And you came to [Unintelligible: 0:38:56] park and then what? 

FINE: We went to my sister’s house 

GEORGE: On the train. On the subway.

FINE: They took us I don’t know; we went to Coney Island—my sister lived there—we went to her house and we stayed with her. 

GEORGE: It was full of food, wonderful food. I remember food.  I must be a child [Laughs].

FINE: We went to my sister and that we stayed there for a few years.

GEORGE: It felt like a couple of years until we got home.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember things that struck you when you first got here that you never say before?

GEORGE: Everything we saw we never saw before because don’t forget where were we? In a little town of Rezekne or Rezekne as its spelled but its Rezekne. 

FINE: We go up there. 

GEORGE: So what did we have? Our first modern city we saw was Riga. 

FINE: That was the capital of Latvia.

GEORGE: That was a very modern city and that was the beginning of our living because before that we were barely existing.

INTERVIEWER: Do your remember any new foods or any things in the apartment that ….?

FINE: Well we were staying with my sister. She used to…they used to feed us there and of course things they gave us which we never ate before you know a lot of the can stuff like tomato herring, you know something different. Then we stayed for a while and then after that we got an apartment, my mother and the three of us we got an apartment and lived close to my sister.

INTERVIEWER: In Coney Island?

FINE: In Coney Island, yes and I had a couple of [Unintelligible: 0:40:38] and my mother lived quite close to us. She liked to go to Shuva every Saturday she used to go, and she only stayed two years. She couldn’t enjoy it. 

GEORGE: Yes.

FINE: Yes she couldn’t enjoy it.

INTERVIEWER: Did your mother…was your mother happy that she had come here?

FINE: Yes, yes, she was happy she was with the rest of the family. She was happy but happiness didn’t last too long.

INTERVIEWER: And how about you? Did you start school right away?

FINE: Yes I used to go to school. I went to school yes.

GEORGE: I was in first grade at ten years old.

FINE: And I went to… I used to sit with the bigger children—they were bigger people. Of course it was a different race.

GEORGE: And you didn’t speak the language so… 

FINE: But we could …the teachers were very nice and we were really treated us nice, and I finished school, and then I got older and I arranged to go to work. I went to work. I used to travel by train.

INTERVIEWER: Where did you go?

FINE: In New York—downtown New York. I used to go. I used to work there. I made dolls clothes; I used to sew dolls clothes and really worked there for years, used to go and change… did this for years.

INTERVIEWER: Do you remember the name of the place where you worked?

FINE: I don’t remember no, no, no.

INTERVIEWER: And do you remember any experiences about learning English?

GEORGE: Well the experience was the fact that when I went to school I had to speak English otherwise you…

FINE: That’s the only way we learned the English language. 

GEORGE: You know they didn’t speak my language and that’s why we learned fast—I did.

FINE: Well he was in higher grade. I had only finished after eighth grade and then I was at a regular age to go to work. I worked and I worked at a factory where they made the ladies underwear. I remember on Broadway I used to work there and I had a good job working the machines, sewing on the machine—I used to sew underwear.  

INTERVIEWER: Was this before you sewed the dolls clothing or after?

FINE: No that was after, after that. Dolls clothes was just the beginning for me to learn how, and I made a salary I don’t remember what I made—didn’t make a lot but it was enough for me to get along, and then…and that’s it. 

INTERVIEWER: And how about you George, you stayed in school?

GEORGE: I stayed in school.

FINE: Yes he went to school longer than all of us.

GEORGE: Yeah well I was the youngest so everybody took care of me, you know. I went to high school; I went to CUNY in New York and I went at night and of course in 1942 I went into the army and put in four years.

INTERVIEWER: And where were you when you were in the army?

GEORGE: Well I fortunately…I was drafted when I was living in Buffalo, New York. I was working out there I was at the [National Church Ops] and when I first came I was in Aberdeen, Maryland, and the ordinance in Aberdeen for the ground—and that is where I met my wife. She’s from Baltimore.

INTERVIEWER: And what’s your wife’s name?

GEORGE: Ruth.

INTERVIEWER: And her maiden name?

GEORGE: Her maiden name is Mazaroff. M-A-Z-A-R-O-F-F.

INTERIVEWER: And how did you meet?

GEORGE: Ah okay its very interesting. I was a mess sergeant and I used to volunteer my mess hall to the Jewish boys on Friday night when they used to have Sabbath services on Friday night.

INTERVIEWER: You donated the mess hall?

GEORGE: The use of the mess hall.

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.

GEORGE: I left it open and retained a crew there to take care of things. We used to have services. Do you know anything about the Jewish people?

INTERVIEWER: Well tell me about the services that would be interesting. 

GEORGE: Okay the services. Jewish people on Friday night have after the services called…

FINE: Kiddush.  

GEORGE: Kiddush. Oneg Shabbat and then after the services you have a little wine and little sweet things to eat. So I volunteered for the use of …to keep my mess hall open for Friday nights for the Jewish boys services. My wife would come out from Baltimore with her aunt from the Jewish Welfare Board, and they would bring out the Oneg Shabbat—the food for the boys at the services, and so they would set up a table in my mess hall and then because the chapels, where we have our services are right next to the mess hall, and they used to bring out all of the goodies and I used to prepare hot water for them to make tea or coffee or whatever they wanted to make, and I kept a few KP’s to help me clean up and that’s how I met my wife.

INTERVIEWER: Wonderful.

GEORGE: …and I married her.

INTERVIEWER: Wonderful. How about you Tillie how did you meet your husband?

FINE: Well I met him…we used to go to clubs. We used to have these clubs to go to…just to go to dances. 

GEORGE: [Interrupts] [Unintelligible: 0:46:07]

INTERVIEWER: Were they ethnic clubs? In other words were they people coming from Eastern Europe that would go there? 

FINE: Well we used to meet the people but at that time they don’t have it now. They used to call like a [lanslite] ball together.  

GEORGE: To answer your question, [lanslite] is Yiddish word meaning kinfolk see, so you would go where all the immigrants or Jewish people or Italian people or Irish people…

FINE: [Interrupts] You used to go. You used to go with us—some friends. We used to go to a dance; we used to dance there and that’s how you meet some fellows there, and sometimes you meet someone decent and sometimes you just take a chance and go. That time was no trouble for traveling alone in those days. We weren’t afraid to go on the train, we used to travel on the train, and then I met my husband later on and we got married. 

INTERVIEWER: And what was your husband’s name?

FINE: Jack.

INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. Uh huh.

GEORGE: And I have five lovely grandchildren.

INTERVIEWER: Wonderful.

GEORGE: The eldest is twenty-one years old, and the next one is twenty…getting old. But I’ve got to relate something to you about my sister in Moscow.  I guess her going to Moscow is like youngsters here go leave the country go to the big city—leave the farm and go to the big city—and while in Moscow she met a young man… 

FINE: [Interrupts] In the army. In the army he was…

GEORGE: No not yet. Not yet. 


FINE: Oh no. 

GEORGE: She was keeping company with a young man who turned out to be a spy for Russia from a foreign government and he was sentenced to die. He was convicted to be executed and she was also convicted because she was his girlfriend. The execution squad –the firing squad—who was going to carry out the sentence…the commander was a Jewish fellow in Russia and my sister was a beautiful girl. Right.  [Long pause]

INTERVIEWER: She must have looked like you Tillie?

TILLE FINE: No she was beautiful.

INTERIVEWER: Well why don’t we…

GEORGE: Anyway he saved our life 

INTERVIEWER: Wow. 

GEORGE: … and he married her. 

INTERVIEWER: Oh that’s how you know the story.

GEORGE: She had the …

FINE: She has three children.

GEORGE: Four.

FINE: Or four children—two boys, two girls.

GEORGE: Two girls. Yeah. She…I guess she has been gone along time too now, hasn’t’ she? 

INTERVIEWER: So she came to this country?

GEORGE: No.

FINE: No no, no, no.

GEORGE: [Interrupts] She went over there…

FINE: She was in Moscow. She was in Moscow.

GEORGE: She went over there twice to see her.

FINE: I went to Moscow to visit her.  

GOERGE FINE: And I went there once, and now she’s gone but she’s got a daughter here and a son.

FINE: That’s right. 

GEORGE: Living on the west coast in California, and she had another son who died. Now she has another daughter who lives in Israel. 

FINE: Yeah.

INTERVIWER: When you went back did you go back to Rezekne [Difficulty pronouncing Rezekne]?

FINE: No. no.

GEORGE: Rezekne. Rezekne.

FINE: No. 

GEORGE: I went back to Moscow to see my sister. 

INTERVIEWER: Yeah but you …okay.

GEORGE: I had no desire to go back to Latvia. 

INTERVIEWER: No, why is that?

FINE: No…that was…no. 

GEORGE: It was that…uh

FINE: we were glad to get out of there. 

GEORGE: It was uh… I had a bad memory of Latvia—persecution—all I knew was persecution and hardship.

FINE: Why wasted…by the time you …there was a…you used to go see the…killed them in the basement…it was a lot of that used to go under [Unintelligible 0:51:24].

INTERVIEWER: When you think about coming here as young people…do you think the fact that you emigrated from another place and started life again in this country…do you think that had an impact? In what way do you think that affected you in your personality and the way you live your life?

GEORGE: I’m living.

FINE: It gave us an uplift.

GEORGE: It’s like a rebirth.

FINE: That’s right…something we didn’t have and we have a little more here.

GEORGE: It’s like a rebirth. I’m telling you. I still talk about it when I get into conversations or discussions and I say I’m proud to be an American.

FINE: We worked hard. We worked hard to make a living and it was hard—its not easy but we got by all right. 

INTERVIEWER: What makes you feel most satisfied about what you’ve done in your life?

FINE: Together with the family and made a big change, and I’m here and that’s it. I have a nice family. Thank God for that.

INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm. How about you George, what makes you feel really satisfied about anything you have done in your life?

GEORGE: I must have done…it must be good because I’m eighty-three years old [laughs].

INTERVIEWER: Yeah, well you look great. 

FINE: We are too young. We are the two youngest. He is the youngest one. 

GEORGE: We are all we’ve got. We are the only family members. 

FINE: We are the only two. We were seven children.

GEORGE: But time goes by so here we are.

INTERVIEWER: Do you think you retain any ways about you that come from the old country?

GEORGE: I think maybe subconsciously. Subconsciously sometimes you know some expressions we use and things like that but other than that I don’t think about leaving at all. 

FINE: No, no.

INTERVIEWER: What’s it like coming back to Ellis Island? Does it…Did you have any emotional reaction to coming here today?

FINE: Yeah. 

GEORGE: Yes it is. How can I explain it? I didn’t think it would be so hard getting anywhere once I got here. 

INTERVIEWER: You didn’t think it would be so hard?
GEORGE: I didn’t think it would be so hard getting my foot off of Ellis Island [laughs]. You know I didn’t know ways of the world you know I was young. I was ten years old and I was a kid when we were coming here and you know going to America there’s movies about that…coming to America I thought but then I didn’t realize all the rigid…and you know tests, and to test to see if you should stay like they show it on the movie there. To see if you can stay… I don’t know what the percentage were sent back but I know some were sent back.  

INTERVIEWER: Two percent.

GEORGE: Yeah two percent. You know its …even one percent is too much to go back that [Unintelligible: 0:54:42] movie we saw said that guy threatened to jump off the ship and they sent him back. It’s true. It’s very hard over there in those years; it’s probably just as bad now I think. I don’t think its any better. 

FINE: I know.

GEORGE: Well look life could be better when you had that massacre in World War II in Europe.

FINE: well we are happy here. I’m happy here. We had bad times too hear, listen but uh…

INTERVIEWER: [Interrupts] Do you remember the Depression here?

GEORGE: Yes, of course.

FINE: Of course. We were here but we made it we did our best. We did our best. 

GEORGE: We worked hard. Hard work. Well…

INTERVIEWER: Lets see is there anything else that you can think of relevant to your immigrating to this country that maybe we haven’t covered?

FINE: Well we are very happy. 

GEORGE: Well its you know I’m sure that by the way I’m speaking that I’m happy to be here and I think this country did a great job—that’s something.  

INTERVIEWER: I think that’s a perfect place to end. I want to thank you both so much…

FINE: Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. 

INTERVIEWER: …very much for a very, very interesting interview. I have been speaking with Tillie Krupp 


FINE: Yes.

INTERVIEWER: and GEORGE. Oh we forgot to tell George…just tell briefly how your name changed at Ellis Island. 

GEORGE: Well most people who come to Ellis Island change the name by dropping something off their name but with me they added a letter to my name. My name was spelled F-I-N 

FINE: Fin.

GEORGE: but it came out spelling it F-I-N-E. 

FINE: It pronounced Fin see, and now its Fine.
