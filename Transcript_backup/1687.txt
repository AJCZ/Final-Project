My sister and I had, and Daddy had one, too. And then one day Daddy had an old sea captain with him. Then he asked that sea captain, "Would you please go and see my daughters? I know they are seasick, yah." So then he came and knocked on the door. He said, "Girls, I want you to get dressed, and I'm going to take you up on the deck." "No," we said, "we can't. We are so sick." He said, "Well, I'll come next time, and if you are not dressed, I'll just take you and put your coat on and come up on the deck," he said. So he did, and that's what happened. He put our two coats on, and took us up on the deck. And we were there only maybe a half hour or a little longer. And from the fresh air we started to feel good, and I started to sing. And I remember the song I sang. MOORE: What was it? SWENSON: ( She recites the words of the song in Finnish. ) Yeah. And from that day we were not sick any more. We were up on the deck every day, yeah. MOORE: Could you sing it? Could you sing that song? SWENSON: I have no voice left. ( Ms. Moore laughs ) That has gone in me up in the air. And (?) can't sing. I have a pretty good singing voice, yeah. ( she laughs ) MOORE: You took singing lessons? SWENSON: Huh? MOORE: Did you take singing lessons? SWENSON: I can't sing nothing any more. MOORE: But when you were younger did you take lessons? SWENSON: Yeah. And I remember once we had an outing, and then the schoolteacher he noticed that I had a good voice. I was about twelve years old, or maybe thirteen. And he said, "Dagmar, won't you sing us a little song?" And we were both boys and girls on an outing, yeah. So then I sang, "(She recites the words to the song in Finnish.)" ( they laugh ) ( they applaud ) I still can remember those words, yeah. MOORE: And, all right. So your father came to Butte, Montana, and he was in a mining accident. SWENSON: Yeah. MOORE: And then he came back home to Finland for three years. SWENSON: Yeah. MOORE: And with the money from the settlement, you were able to go together. SWENSON: Yeah. MOORE: All right. And, so, you're on board, and you're seasick. You were seasick, and then the captain, the sea captain helped you. SWENSON: Yeah. MOORE: Okay. Do you remember what the food was like? Were you able to eat? SWENSON: Well, I don't know. I had pictures of the school. I can't say it. Just a regular building, a big room, with seats for the children, yeah. MOORE: Okay. Do you remember on your boat trip from Finland to the United States?

SWENSON: Oh, we got so happy. I didn't cry after that. ( they laugh ) No. MOORE: And do you remember when your mother came, do you remember? SWENSON: Oh, yeah. MOORE: What was it like? SWENSON: Oh, it was so, we all hugged, you know. We all, yah. It was beautiful. But the sad part was it was too big a change of climate. She got pleurisy and got TB, took sick, and stayed in bed. The doctor, our doctor's name was Silverbury, and he wanted to put her in the hospital. Mother said, "Please, don't send me to the hospital. I don't understand what people talk." So we said, "Mother, you don't have to go." So Alice, my younger sister, she took care of my mother, stayed home, and Vera and I went to work, yeah. That's how it started, yeah. MOORE: And how long did your mother live then? SWENSON: She lived till Easter Eve. She passed away on Easter Eve. And, boy, it was sad, yeah. Very sad. MOORE: And who took care of the youngest children then? Who took care of the children, then? When she passed away, what about your youngest sister? How old was she? SWENSON: Vera? MOORE: Your youngest sister, the little one? SWENSON: That was another story. She got some pain in her leg, some kind of disease, so Dr. Silverbury, he said we have to send her to an orthopedic hospital. And there she was for three years, my sister. She had a disease, some kind of disease. Then my, let's see now. Now I got mixed up. I got mixed up. My sister got some work in New York. She worked for a family called Wood. She was a governess, yeah. And then she wrote to me to Seattle and said, "My," Oskar Niland was the one that sent me the letter that the family could come to America. So then, now let's see. ( she laughs ) Now, how was it? Then my sister said, "Niland read me the paper that a professor an experienced doctor is coming to New York from Austria, and he will do bloodless operations." So then I went, I went took Judy out of the Mt. Sinai Orthopedic Hospital, and we went to New York, and Judy had that operation, yeah. But . . . MOORE: Did she get better? SWENSON: It's a long story, so I can't start it. Her life was so sad, the whole life, so I can't start to . . . MOORE: Explain. SWENSON: Tell her any more, no. MOORE: Well, you, then, did you go to school in the United States at all? Did you go to school here? SWENSON: Yeah, a little bit, soon as we came here to Seattle, we started evening school right away. MOORE: And what were you taking? What classes? What type of school? SWENSON: We had to start from ABC's. ( she laughs ) MOORE: And did you learn English here? SWENSON: Yah. And then, you know, my sister and I, the first thing we got, we got a place in a hotel to make up beds, you know. Yeah. And the schoolteacher that we had in the evening was living in that hotel. And then she took Vera and me three times a week for extra lessons because she saw how eager we were to learn, yeah. MOORE: And so you, how was learning English for you? Was it easy to learn English? SWENSON: Well, it was, it wasn't so hard as I thought it would be, no. But we loved to learn, yeah. MOORE: And do you remember making any mistakes in English? SWENSON: Oh, I can't remember that, no. Yeah. ( she laughs ) Yeah. MOORE: And so . . . SWENSON: But, you know, to pronounce, you know, I still have an accent. I guess I can't help that, no. MOORE: It's a nice accent. SWENSON: Yeah. ( she laughs ) Well, anyway, so . . . MOORE: So you went to work. Now, how did you meet your husband? How did you meet your husband? SWENSON: Through correspondence, the same Oskar Niland. So I had been married twice. I was Niland for sixteen years we were married, yeah. MOORE: With whom? SWENSON: Oskar Niland was his name. MOORE: Oskar Niland, right. And then he wrote to me and said, well, after Mother died, he said, "Why don't you take a trip to New York and get a little change?" Because I cried all the time. I was such a crybaby, yah. So then I went. I went to New York. And I started to work there. And then, finally, he was a painter, you know, yeah. When he lived in Portland, Oregon, he had his own business. He was, and he played with the Portland Symphony Orchestra. He played second violin, yeah. He liked to play, you know. Yeah. MOORE: So you lived in New York. SWENSON: Yeah. MOORE: And he lived where?

MOORE: Where in New York did you live? SWENSON: In Bronx. MOORE: In the Bronx? Where in the Bronx? SWENSON: It's terrible now. We were home and I wouldn't want to live there for anything. MOORE: Do you remember the address? Do you remember . . . SWENSON: Yes, Ogden Avenue. MOORE: Ogden. SWENSON: It was near the Yankee Stadium. MOORE: Yes, yes, yes. I lived there, too.

MOORE: Do you remember Varma? Varma Cooperatives? Varma? Never mind. On Gerard Avenue, one cooperative was there. SWENSON: Oh, yeah, I guess so. MOORE: Yeah, never mind, it's all right. ( they laugh ) All right. So you lived sixteen years in the Bronx. Okay. And then what happened? Did you have children? SWENSON: No. MOORE: No. SWENSON: No. But when, but then when my husband died, I was a widow for almost seven years, yeah. And then Karl Swenson's wife died, and then we sang in the same church choir and the Ring The Bell Choir, so we knew each other. MOORE: Where? In New York? SWENSON: In New York, yeah. And then, so finally we got married. I got married the second time, yeah. MOORE: Do you remember Ematra House in Brooklyn? Do you remember the Ematra? Ematra House in Brooklyn? The Finn Hall.

SWENSON: Yeah. MOORE: And then what happened? SWENSON: Well, then, after a few years my husband said he had never had a vacation. So then he took a vacation, and we took a trip to the West Coast, and my big sister Vera, she lived here in Seattle, yeah. So we, we took a train to New York, yah. Yah. And we were, of course, then he went to Portland, because he used to work there and play with the orchestra, so he wanted to see Portland again. So we went there too, yah.
