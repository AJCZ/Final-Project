LEVINE: This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm here today in Babylon, New York, with Mr. Christo Dakides. DAKIDES: Right. It's okay, Dakides. LEVINE: Dakides, okay. Christo Dakides. I'm right here with Mr. and Mrs. Dakides, and today is March 24, 1992. Mr. Dakides came to the United States in 1915 from Greece when he was six years old. DAKIDES: That's right. LEVINE: Well, I'm very happy to be here, and I'm glad I got lost so I didn't miss you. DAKIDES: ( he laughs ) It's okay. LEVINE: And why don't I start by asking you your birth date? DAKIDES: My birthday? LEVINE: Yeah. DAKIDES: March 30, 1909, I was born. LEVINE: And where were you born? What town? DAKIDES: Well, I'll tell you, you know, there's so many wars, like here now, every nationality. The Turks captured ( he laughs ) the Greek ground, you understand? And I was born between there. But there was no birth certificates, because there's wars, just like now Europe, people get born, this and that. I was during the clash for Turks and Greece. And when the Turks were coming more nearer to capture, my father was a merchant man, you know, sell those, you know, handkerchiefs and this small thing. When he heard that coming, and they were bombing airplanes in the backyards, big holes. It's amazing. One, two, three, four, six big holes. You could put a car in, so damage is done. LEVINE: Did you see that, or that was before you were born? DAKIDES: No. I seen that, I seen that. I was five years old. And after they bombed the whole place, then my father took me to the main street, and all the people that got killed, they were lined up in the sidewalk, you know. It's horrible. Blood all over. I was a small kid. I distinctly remember. So my father says, "Well, there's no use staying here." And that was the opportunity to get the heck out of here. So, of course, he had some money. If he didn't have no money I wouldn't be here. ( he laughs ) I wouldn't be here. On account of him, he bribed himself, he had a bribe, you know, just like any other place, to put you in a headline, he had to pay that. If you don't pay, you stay here in Greece a lifetime. So he paid through. He paid the boat was got to be reasonable to sleep, and it was. It was like a barn down there. They had only cots in there. You ought to be happy you're getting out of here. So while we were going on the ocean, the captain had to zig zag because there was a lot of torpedoes, the German, to knock these because these were freight ships, you know. Having, carrying the heavy objects. So they were running back and forth, so their job was to bombard, sink it. So the captain had to go back and forth, back and forth. Finally we made it. We escaped. LEVINE: How long were you on the sea? DAKIDES: Oh, the sea was quite long, quite long. Because everybody in the ship, they were saying their prayers, you know. Finally we crossed the line, we got out of the submarine bombard, and we were going steadily. Then was rumors in the ship that if you're not healthy they wouldn't accept you. They're going to send you back where you come from. That's the rules. So everybody was praying to have their health, you know. To make them. Otherwise forget it. So they clipped my hair, you know, there's a lot of kids who get those lice. Clipped it up completely. My sisters, my brothers. Well, we made it. So we see the Ellis Island. My father was showing me, here it is, and it's amazing. When I was a small kid it didn't impress me at all, you know. And my mother was happy we made it. But they were worried, my mother and father was worried, "I hope we don't have no sickness or disease." They wouldn't accept you. You go back, that's it. And we made it, and we went to, how you call that, the, uh, Island? LEVINE: Ellis Island. DAKIDES: Ellis Island. And he knew a couple of friends, his buddy in Greece that came to the United States beforehand, and got contact with him. And they came over. He had to have somebody to recommend you to bring you over. And we went over, and we were happy. But my father didn't know English to talk, only Greek. He was making an easy living. He was a merchant man, you know, buy and sell. So what happened is to get a job his friends recommended the United Biscuit Company to work, and he got a job there. But he didn't know English to talk, you know. It was wicked, and it was hard. So we made it. And working so hard, then we went, his cousin got married with a Greek girl and her father was a furrier. Through him I learned the trade as a furrier. So many years I worked, and I was making a nice living, you know. No hardship. But gradually things getting wicked, you know, to work out. So my father, he always used to say, "Learn a damn thing, a trade, anything. You could make a living. If you're ordinary, no trade, nothing, you'll suffer." Just like now, the boys that don't want to learn a trade, nothing, the heck with it. So I am thankful I came here to the United States. And this, I was telling my daughter, "Daddy, Daddy, don't forget." She wrote a letter, and it was simple. Well, I came here, I got married. What are they, Hungarian. My wife is a Hungarian. MRS. DAKIDES: Hungarian descent. DAKIDES: Descent. Two daughters I had. I was lucky. They got married, you know. Nowadays they don't get married, it's a headache. They got married. I have two grandchildren. Two boys, no, two girls. That's Stephanie, yeah. Then Carol, she had a boy and a girl, and they got college education. I have told my daughter, regardless, learn to make an easy buck, you know what I mean? Not like my father and your father. Easy. So they learned, what did the son learn? Like his father? Insurance. What kind of a trade is it? MRS. DAKIDES: Actuary. DAKIDES: Actuary. Get paid well, you know what I mean? Make an easy living, not like me, or my father, struggling. And then her daughter, what Carol's daughter took out? A doctor, or whatever? ( Mrs. Dakides answers off mike. ) No, no, no. She had two, a boy and a girl. The boy, the actuary. The girl, what she took up, make an easy living? MRS. DAKIDES: Nothing that I know of. Nothing in particular. DAKIDES: All right. I'll let it go. Anyway, she got a position to make an easy dollar, that's all. Because, now a days . . . LEVINE: Let me take you back first to do you remember being in Greece at all, before you left? DAKIDES: Yeah. I remember just faintly. LEVINE: When you think about Greece, when you were a little boy there, what do you remember? DAKIDES: I remember my house was on a mountain. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: Oh. And can you describe it? DAKIDES: It was up the hill. And that's what I remember. Then from there you go down to the main street. LEVINE: Do you remember what the house looked like at all? DAKIDES: No. It fades. I can't. LEVINE: And you were too young to go to school. DAKIDES: Too young for school. LEVINE: And you had brothers and sisters? DAKIDES: Yeah. I had brothers and sisters. LEVINE: What were their names? DAKIDES: Uh, Talmo, and who was the other one? MRS. DAKIDES: George, George. DAKIDES: Yeah, George, Talmo and George, and me. LEVINE: Okay. Let me just say it would be better if we didn't talk, because I'm not going to be able to pick up the other end of the conversation. So afterwards we can say whatever. ( refers to Mrs. Dakides interjecting ) So okay. So you had George and Tal? DAKIDES: Talmo. That's his name. LEVINE: And you had a mother and father. And you had a sister, Susan? DAKIDES: Yeah. I had a sister, Susan. She's still living. LEVINE: Now, did you all come over at the same time? DAKIDES: Yeah. We all come over. LEVINE: Okay. Now, do you remember your brothers and sisters when you were still in Greece? Can you remember? DAKIDES: No. It just fades, fades. LEVINE: Okay. How about your mother's maiden name. Do you remember that? DAKIDES: Maiden name? Effazini George. That's what her name was. LEVINE: Okay. And how about your father's name? DAKIDES: Stephano. MRS. DAKIDES: George. DAKIDES: No, no, Stephano. LEVINE: Stephano. Okay. And now you remember the bombing in World War I? DAKIDES: Oh, yeah. I remember. It was horrible. We all had to go to the basement, and I fled, you know, when they explode, whatever. And when they dropped those bombs, I don't know what the hell they had, like whistling, horrible whistling. Boom! And we were lucky, all the bombs that dropped from our yard wasn't a long distance from here to there. Big holes. God, a lot of people got killed. After that my father took me to the main street, and it was horrible. All lined up, killed, bleeding. It was terrible. But I'm lucky I came to the United States. LEVINE: Do you remember what your mother and father thought about what they, when they came to America, do you know what they expected? Do you know what they . . . DAKIDES: They expected to, gold money in the street, you know. That's a hullabaloo. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: But people believed it. DAKIDES: Believed it. But the only thing my father says, regardless how poor you are, you could have a loaf of bread, butter, was the most item to exist. In Greece you couldn't get that. LEVINE: In Greece it was hard times. DAKIDES: Very hard, very hard. LEVINE: And now, what did your father do in Greece? DAKIDES: He was a merchant. What the hell do you call this here? ( he gestures ) The woman wearing . . . LEVINE: The veil? DAKIDES: No veil. No, no. I can't . . . ( he gets up, break in the tape ) He knows what was going on, and he was making a nice living. He happened to have money just in time. And he made up his mind, because the way the bombing, airplane coming, bombarding and all of that. He had money. If he didn't have money I wouldn't be here. He had to bribe through the channel in order to get passport from the Italian ship to come to the United States. LEVINE: Now, do you remember what your family packed, what they took with them from Greece? DAKIDES: They didn't take nothing. Empty. They were lucky to be on the ship, my dear. LEVINE: Okay. So then you had to leave from your small town. Do you remember the name of that town? ( he laughs ) No, you don't. DAKIDES: I don't, my dear. I was only four or five years old. LEVINE: But you went to Athens, and that's where you got the boat. Is that right? DAKIDES: Right. From Athens, no. From Athens, we got the boat, and we go in Italy, and they put us in the freight. ( he laughs ) How about that. But we were lucky we got there. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: So did it take a long time, by the time, for you to get on a boat at all, even a freighter? DAKIDES: Well, it was quite a long time, torture. You're going to make it, not make it. And then we were worried, do we have any disease, you know, all that. It counts every bit of it. LEVINE: Now, do you remember where you went in Italy, where you left from? DAKIDES: No, I don't, my dear. I don't remember. But it must be a dock for the boats that they go to the United States. That's all. LEVINE: You don't remember which ship it was? DAKIDES: No, no, no. LEVINE: Okay. So can you describe, then, the ship. Whatever you remember about the ship that you travelled on. DAKIDES: Well, it was down in the basement. If not basement, I don't know what word I could use. LEVINE: I think they call it down in the hold. DAKIDES: In the hold it was, that's all. We were lucky, that's all. LEVINE: And people were . . . DAKIDES: Oh, the people were frightened if they're going to make it or not. You know, bombarding. You make it, you don't make it. That's the way it is. So we made it. But my father came to the United States. He was tortured, you know. He was making an easy living, you know, and he had to work in the United Biscuit Company. He's lucky he got that job. He couldn't talk English. And it was . . . LEVINE: Then did you start school then, soon after you came? DAKIDES: Yeah, I started. Six. LEVINE: And then did you learn English real quickly, or . . . DAKIDES: Yeah, I started to learn English little by little. But my father used to say, "Learn a trade, for the love of Pete, to make a living." You know, that was the favorite thing. So I had two, four grandchildren, I says, "Learn something to make a mighty dollar, not to struggle." If you're ordinary, forget it. It's torture. LEVINE: So tell me now, you went through school. And then were you working while you were going to school? DAKIDES: Well, I got a job. Not much. I delivered papers. LEVINE: And where were you living then when you first settled in the United States? DAKIDES: I first settled in the United States is Manhattan, 22nd Street, and it was Hell's Kitchen. LEVINE: What do you remember about that? DAKIDES: Hell Kitchen? It was a tough neighborhood. ( he laughs ) A tough neighborhood. They beat you up, you know, usually, Brooklyn, whatever it was, there's always a crowd. MRS. DAKIDES: You were a lamplighter, too. DAKIDES: Lamplighter. I used to help the lamplighter, and 22nd Street he used to go all the ways down to 14th Street, 14th Street to the river. And there was a market: vegetables, fruits and meat. Poultry, too. That was the nerve center. Whenever you passed there, you thought you were in the country. You smelled the vegetables, and this and that. It was so nice. MRS. DAKIDES: And the German bakeries . . . DAKIDES:German bakeries. It was sentimental. LEVINE: Were there a lot Greek people in Hell's Kitchen when you were there? DAKIDES: Well, there were. There were. Half and half. Mixture. LEVINE: Of Greek and what else? DAKIDES: Greek, Italian, Hungarian, you know, and so forth. It was a mixed race. But, of course, there is, some blocks was just the Greek neighborhood. Another block was Italian neighborhood, Spanish neighborhood. But just here and there, not much. LEVINE: Can you remember when you first arrived, what you thought, what you remember seeing? DAKIDES: Listen, there's not recording here. I'm talking, talking. ( refers to microphone ) Oh, I have it. LEVINE: Yeah, you've got it on. Yeah, it's fine. Do you remember what struck you as different? Do you remember when you first came to New York what impressed you, or . . . DAKIDES: Impressed me? Well, at that time there was horse and wagon, garbage collectors, you know. And as the years passed by they improved it. They took the horses away, they took the horses away delivering milk. They made gasoline trucks. But it was sentimental on the milk delivery. Because early in the morning, four or five o'clock, the horses, click-clack, click- clack. It was a tune, far away, echoes. It was so nice, sentimental. Now it's gone. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: What else do you remember as a little boy that has changed since then? DAKIDES: Changed? Well, there was Macy's. They had beautiful horses. Very attractive horses, you know, taking care of them. They delivered the merchandise, like you bought something. Beautiful horses, gorgeous. I see not, that faded away too. And I seen the Budweiser horses, beautiful horses. They still have them, but they have them like a novelty. And what to tell you? It's gone, that, what I used to remember. It's gone. Macy's, beautiful horses they have, beautiful horses. They had, on 12th Street, not 12th Street, 10th Street, was all stables, you know, one block, and two blocks long, three. Just horses, stables to take care of them, but that's gone, too. That's years ago. LEVINE: Were these the horses that were used for delivering things? DAKIDES: For delivery things, for garbage, milk. Then it came to revolutionize, turn in the horses. They took the horses out and they put gasoline trucks. The same thing with Macy's. They put that, too. It was beautiful, but nothing stands still. It disappears. LEVINE: What else do you remember from your childhood in New York? DAKIDES: Well, that time, they were making, on the roads, rocks to build roads. They didn't do that. They couldn't get that rocks, so they used boards. They cut them up like blocks, blocks. And they dip it in the tar. And then when they level the ground, they start lining them up like bricks. And it wasn't much noise, the trucks passing by. It killed the noise. I remember that. That's gone, too. They got now blocks. LEVINE: Those cobblestones. DAKIDES: Cobblestones. When they had that, then, forget about it, they put cobblestones on top, tar. Make it noiseless. So that was an improvement, here and there. Yeah, things go by. LEVINE: Do you remember being in school? What do you remember about school when you were little? DAKIDES: School I remember. I wasn't so good at it because I left school when I was able to work, to help my parents. That was the tradition. Forget about the education. But now I had four grandchildren. I bug them to learn regardless what the heck it is, to make a mighty dollar, because I remember if you're ordinary you suffer, from the beginning to the end. LEVINE: What else was a tradition with your mother and father? DAKIDES: My mother and father were very religious people, you know, Greek Orthodox, and this and that. And they did their best. My mother used to get homework to put women blouse with handwork in order to survive. LEVINE: Now, did she do that in Greece before that? DAKIDES: No. Well, she knew about it, but when she came here she was handy about it. So word of mouth, they give a blouse to sew by hand. You get paid, not much, just to exist. So that's it. My mother suffered. My parents suffered. Every one of them suffered. LEVINE: How about your brothers and sisters? DAKIDES: My brothers and sisters, the only thing, my sister learned to be x-ray technician, to make a living, a good living, you know. And by she didn't know much about it, and at that time they didn't give you blankets when they take x-ray. They didn't give it to you when you go one place or another. And she got, what the hell you call it, cancer in the blood. She die young. She was only forty-five years old. So the only thing is they had to put a machine, take the blood out and purify it and put it back again. But it didn't last. She passed away. She was educated in the family. LEVINE: Yes. She was the educated one. DAKIDES: That's right. LEVINE: And what about your brothers? DAKIDES: My brother, he tried to learn a trade, what I was. But he was impatient. MRS. DAKIDES: He was in the army for a while. DAKIDES: Oh, yeah, he went to the Army. That was the Second World War. DAKIDES: No, I was the only one, I learned a trade and helped my parents in many ways, that's all. And I remember I worked in one place. Now, forget about it. I worked at the place twenty-seven years, you know, furrier. And some way, somehow, my boss comes over and he says, "How long you working here?" I says, "Oh, guess how old I am?" "What? Seventy." "Not seventy. Sixty- five, sixty-six." He starts hollering, "Get the hell out of here." Even though I worked twenty-five years. That hurts me terrific. And I came home and I says to my wife, the boss, he got, what the hell you call that? He became a president to throw out the old bags. Let me put it that way, the slang way. Throw old bags in the shop. Wherever people that were working ten, fifteen years, they had to go out, that's all. And now I came to a point, I am retired, and I hear a guy working thirty-five years, you're dumped. Forty years, you're dumped. No more security. And the public is becoming nuts. There's no security. If they go into work, they don't know how long it's going to last. This depression is the worst thing. When Hoover was the president, no work. Everybody knew there was no work. Here's torture. It's better to tell the truth and get the heck out of here. It's torture. People working twenty-five years, thrown out. Fifteen years. It don't mean a thing. And things are different now. I don't know what the hell it's going to become. Because . . . LEVINE: What are the biggest changes that you've seen over the years? DAKIDES: Over the years I've seen big changes. Cars progress, up to date, modern. And if you come to bolts and nuts, it didn't change much to make a living. The same story. You hear a guy working thirty-five years, dump. That time was security. There's no security now. A young guy goes out to work, he doesn't know if he comes back with a job. It's so badly done. And they have to do something about it. That's all I could say. All right, I'm old. I'm eighty-three. I'm over the hills. You know. I get my pension. But the young generations, there's no background. I don't know what the hell it's going to become. I am happy. The boss threw me out. Before I used to get angry, but I'm happy he done that, because it will wake me up, that's all. So the guys who get jobs, they don't know how long. If they're going to work one year, two years, no. LEVINE: Well, tell me about, do you remember the Statue of Liberty, when you first came to New York do you remember seeing it? DAKIDES: Far away, my dear. Far away. But when I had the two kids, we went with the kids. MRS. DAKIDES: Yeah, we went up. DAKIDES: So four kids, I had, yeah. We went to the Statue of Liberty. MRS. DAKIDES: Did it mean a lot to you, or . . . DAKIDES: Well, it means a lot, but I remember that I came to the United States the first thing I had to see was the Statue of Liberty. God's country. LEVINE: Do you remember Ellis Island? Do you remember it? DAKIDES: Just faint, faint. I don't remember. MRS. DAKIDES: You know what? We, when you're going to fix up Ellis Island . . . LEVINE: Why do you think the United States was God's country? DAKIDES: You could make a good living. Not the new law. The new law is no good. You die quicker. Nerve is down. It's not easy, my dear. You know, we have cars, this and that. You got a family, two, three kids. You go to work, no work. This is horrible. This is torture. They should change it. Washington, DC should change our methods, what they have. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO LEVINE: Can you think of anything else that, you know, ways that your mother and father were that they tried to teach you to be? DAKIDES: Be educated. Learn a trade so you can make a living. Because they went through that. If you don't know no trade, nothing, you're just like a dog, you know? But if you have education, like my two, my daughter and my grandson, they got education. They don't have to do what I done. They get paid, of course they're not going to be millionaires, but they will be educated, well paid. And that's it. My sister learned the x-ray technician, got well-paid, but it has obstacles. She got cancer in the blood. That's all it is. LEVINE: Now, tell me, how did you meet your wife? DAKIDES: Oh, my wife. ( he laughs ) I met my wife in the YMCA. LEVINE: Tell me about that? DAKIDES: What street is that? Fifteenth? MRS. DAKIDES: Fifteenth Street and, oh, and Seventh or Eighth. LEVINE: Fifteenth Street. MRS. DAKIDES: Fifth Avenue. DAKIDES: Fifth Avenue. It was a YMCA, a big building, and I wanted to learn how to dance. So I went there, because the other place is a racket. To learn to dance pay fifteen, twenty, thirty, you know. Milk it. There's no end to it. So I went in here. It's a group, girls and boys, to learn how to dance. LEVINE: How old were you then, about? DAKIDES: How old was I? MRS. DAKIDES: Thirty-five. DAKIDES: Thirty, yeah. Old bag, thirty-five. So finally I learn, and I was anxious to meet a girl, you know, to be, companionship. I met her. I liked her. I had such a good time. Square-dancing and all that. All of a sudden she disappears. Three months. I told my mother. She said, "You must have been fresh." "No, Ma. I wasn't fresh." ( he laughs ) She don't show up. Finally she shows up. I says, "Where the heck were you?" "Oh, I was at my mother's house painting her house." I says, "Gee, I'm glad I met you." So that time, I met her, I says I better go introduce my mother and my father. Took her to Poughkeepsie where my father and mother live. And they liked her. And I says, "Well, I'll get married." But I was hesitating to get married, you know, to hold you down, you know, responsibility. So I got hitched. And the funny part is, when I went to the City Hall to get the license, believe it or not my legs wouldn't walk upstairs. I says, "I can't walk." She hollers, "Make up your mind. You want to get married or not?" So finally we got married. LEVINE: Now, what is your wife's name? DAKIDES: Helen. LEVINE: And maiden name? DAKIDES: Oh, what's your last? Harlacher. Helen Harlacher. LEVINE: How do you spell Harlacher? MRS. DAKIDES: H-A-R-L-A-C-H-E-R. LEVINE: Okay. And then you had, together, two children or three children? DAKIDES: No, two we had. We had two. Two girls, that's all. Two girls. LEVINE: And what are your girls' names? MRS. DAKIDES: The girls' names? The younger one is Carolyn and the older one is Stephanie. LEVINE: Stephanie and Carolyn. Uh-huh. And then they each have two children. DAKIDES: Yeah, they have two children, and a boy. And now, as I say, get educated. I was bugging them to learn a trade, darn it. Anything, so you could, because you'll suffer. There's no escape. So . . . ( Mrs. Dakides starts to tell story, but off tape. ) LEVINE: Wait, can you tell the story so I can get it on tape? You've got the microphone. DAKIDES: All right, all right dear. So my Stephanie, she became a teacher. It was, you know, a steady job, getting paid good. Some way, some how, economic came in, they dumped her, you know, like just they do all over now, been dumped. How many times she had a house, she had kids. Mortgage had to pay. The bank don't want to know nothing. So she went shopping all around. She couldn't find anything. So one of the girlfriends says, "There's a job for you in prisons, Sing-Sing. Killers." So she took that job. I was hollering her, "They are killers." "But Daddy, I got to make a dollar regardless." And she took the job. She has to dress not sexy, you know, clothes, not to be attractive. And don't have personality. Just talk. Cold as ice. They're all killers. LEVINE: Is she teaching school there? DAKIDES: Yeah. She's teaching school, because these guys that she's teaching, they're going to be graduated, be good boys, and come to civilian life. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: One other thing I wanted to remember to ask you about was when your mother came over you had mentioned in your form that she had some coins. DAKIDES: Oh. Whenever my father used to go to different countries he used to get gold coins for my mother as a gift, bring it. And we had all different kind of coins. LEVINE: So when your father was a merchant in Greece, he was travelling to other countries. DAKIDES: Yes, small towns. LEVINE: Towns, or did he go over the oceans? Did he go . . . DAKIDES: No, not over the towns. Where they make, for the hats and handkerchiefs and so forth. So he was, for him travelling was more education, you know. And that's it. LEVINE: So your mother had these gold coins? DAKIDES: Yeah, she had them, darn it. It's not fair. She gave one, a heavy one to another, her husband. But you see it right, it was heavy gold, you know, it's worth it. She gave it to my other sister. That's what I'm disappointed. On top of that, she didn't, she could have gave the gold to me, but whenever you mention my sister money, that's how you think. Money. I don't want to hear it. She passed away. The money and all that, he got it. That was the most stupid thing. LEVINE: You mean her husband? Your sister's husband got it. DAKIDES: Huh? Her husband, yeah. He got it. And the gold, he got it. Everything. I had the nerve to ask him, but since I found out his characteristic, forget it. He's mean, you know. I ask him a simple question, can he introduce me to your attorney. I want to make a will, this and that. "Ah, don't bother me. Call somebody else." I says, "For the love of Pete, my sister left you so much money." She left him, let's see, about a hundred G's. Three hundred G's. Both of them. But stupid my sister. You mention money, it's a curse. She did not think of it. Well, anyway, this guy is lucky now. He has 300 G's, he got the house, he painted, he, of course he got married. I'm glad about it. But my sister didn't think. LEVINE: Yeah. Okay. Well, is there anything else that you can think of that you would like to say that has to do with you coming here from Greece and, you know, having a life here. DAKIDES: Yeah, I'm happy because this house, what you see, was a summer home. I insulated. I did electric wiring. I put hot water. I was handy. If I depended on a plumber, an electrician, forget it. I done it all by myself. And I got reward. I have no mortgage. The only thing is the tax that hit you. There's no escape. You've got to pay for it. That's all. I am thankful. Now I am enjoying it at ease. I see my grandchildren growing big. I see my grandson graduated. He'd be able to make a buck. I'm happy. That's a little trifle improvement. And that's it. LEVINE: Great. Well, I think that's a good place to end, and I thank you. This is Christo . . . DAKIDES: Dakides. LEVINE: Dakides. DAKIDES: Right, right. LEVINE: And I'm here at his home in Babylon, New York, and this is Janet Levine signing off for that National Park Service.
