Um, do you remember, uh, when you were here in the beginning, were there certain things about this country that were so different to you then? PISTILLI: (?) very good. Everybody work. I need (?). You couldn't help it. First off, my father was in the first World War. LEVINE: Yeah. PISTILLI: My sister, she got married, her husband was a priest, a priest in Belgium. LEVINE: Oh, uh-huh. Was it difficult for you to learn English? PISTILLI: Huh? LEVINE: Do you remember, do you remember trying to learn English? PISTILLI: I didn't go to school, see, the little bit that I, when I was working, I had a nice boss, going to work, and he used to give me a special job. And when I live with my cousin, I used to get up at four o'clock in the morning, scrub outside (?) Friday, leave everything clean, and go around in the, (?) the door open, because I was late, five minutes. He was so good that I know what I have to do, and I had to have (?). I was in the hospital in Germantown. And one morning the door opened, somebody come in. I say, "Hey, Bill, what are you doing here?" It was my boss. Give the paper to the people sick in the hospital. And he was so good to me. When I saw him, then I was there for nine days, and I went to live with my cousin, till I got home, because I didn't have nobody here, my husband had to go to work. I stayed one week there, and I got better. Then I got another operation, I get an operation on day thirty-nine, then I left to my feet. I got a poor circulation. They couldn't take the bunion out. They had to take just the nail off. I suffer my feet, and the cramps at night and day. LEVINE: How do you feel now? PISTILLI: I broke my leg one night at my daughter's house. Get up in the middle of the night and I fell. And he put the brace, and I see I got both here, so I couldn't, I couldn't move my legs, you know. And I woke up (?). It's all (?). LEVINE: Well, when you're, when you're sitting in the chair during the day . . . PISTILLI: Huh? LEVINE: When you're sitting in the chair during the day, do you think back about, about your life, and about times when you were a little girl, and things like that? PISTILLI: I worry all the (?), all I got in my head, full of things. LEVINE: What's in your mind? PISTILLI: I don't know. I sleep, I didn't sleep good. I got a lot of dreams, lot and lot of dreams. And my daughter, she used to give me a (?). But if I see something the day before and I dream in the night, then I sit, I feel, oh, God, it's this, and I (?), but I fell all the time. Now my fingers, I can't crochet no more. I made so many blanket, so many children's blanket. I think one day, I have sixty-two blankets, for bedspreads. I'm tired in the house. And my daughter, she said to me, "You couldn't do a lot of thing. The doctor say you walk around and don't sit down. You sit down and no good. You walk no good. What can you do?" I sew the blanket, the baby blanket for my nephew. He used to come back for me. He went to Italy. His daughter going to have a baby for Christmas. And my daughter say I got a lot of worry. You better do something. Move your hands some more. And I started on, and I knit, I had to finish next week. I start more, because this eye is bad, and this one is . . . LEVINE: Well, what do you enjoy doing now? PISTILLI: I enjoy, I used to love to cook. How many times I cook ravioli, homemade, all my family. My son, these kids, he says more I raised them, four. He used to go out, like my daughter, she used to bring her children on Friday. My husband, he used to, they had a store, a grocery store, my daughter. My son, my husband, before he came down, he used to take the kids and take them to my house on a Friday. And buy everything he needed, and he came on a Sunday to cook, to eat at my house. My house, he was a good worker outside. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And that gave you a lot of pleasure? PISTILLI: Oh, (?) work in the yard. I mean, and this week I made, I cook two pound of beans. Two pound of, I made the (?). Nine pieces of each, like this. I make the gravy, and I cook the beans, and I made the gravy all this afternoon, because a big pot like this, I made a lot of gravy to fry, fry meat firs,t and then put. And then came my nephew, he's forty-two. I got a daughter, she's forty-five, granddaughter. So my daughter, the first daughter. They all came to eat. This week they went to Italy, uh, daughter-in-law, she stay with me to keep company. And she said, "Theresa, when you gonna cook?" "I'm too tired, Jane." "I thought you loved to cook." I used to love to cook, but I ain't got the strength that I had. I made another, one day I made squash with mushrooms, and onions, peppers, big. I don't know if you use it. Another day I made, she, her husband's a good fisherman, we had fish for two nights. She brought a pizza, because she's got two children, her daughter- in-law. I wash, and I fold clothes. Then I help her to fold clothes, I wash and pour in the machine. But when I get tired, I get tired, I can't help her. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Well, are you glad you came to this country? PISTILLI: Oh, yeah. I'm so glad, yeah. Well, I admire my (?). I can't forget my home town. I was ten years old. I went to school with a girl, she died, nine years old. Her mother was combing her hair, and she died in her mother's lap. And I went to the funeral for that girl before I went to, I moved from there. And her mother, they made a statue for her made out of stone. I went back, when I went in '64, me and my husband, we went to see, I used to tell my husband, "I'm gonna go to my home town, yes, because I'm going to show you that statue, that girl died when she was nine years old." He couldn't believe, he couldn't believe that I remember over there. LEVINE: And did you see it? PISTILLI: This was in '64. I went to see it, I took him, and we went in the cemetery. The cemetery over there is special in Italy, the stone work. And my husband, he loved that kind. But when we walked around, we used to stop. I said, "I'm tired." I say, "Let's go." Pasquale, "No, I want to see the other one. I want to see the cemetery." With the other statue, one statue look like she got a (?) through her, (?) stone. My husband, he knew that kind of work, he loved it. And my daughter, she used to say, my son, he said, "Why don't you go to Italy?" "Oh, I don't want to go." (?), see. He lost all ambition. He stayed with me for three or four months. It was no life for him. He get off of here, he go back to the girlfriend. Then he was living with her ten years. She was so good, she is so good.

And I was stronger, I moved from my house because I couldn't pay the tax. LEVINE: Well, let me ask you this. Is there any advice, is there any advice that you would give to your great- grandchildren?
