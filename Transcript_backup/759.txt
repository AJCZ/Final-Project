Today is Wednesday, April 24th and we are at the home of her daughter Martie Hackett in Willingboro, New Jersey. Mrs. Horan, could you please give me your full name, including your maiden name, and your date of birth. HORAN: Margaret Convery. SIGRIST: And your date of birth? HORAN: The ninth of May, 1896.

SIGRIST: Can you tell me, who was your father? HORAN: My father worked in the iron works in Scotland. SIGRIST: What was his name? HORAN: John. SIGRIST: I see. And was he Scottish? HORAN: Uh, no. He was Irish. SIGRIST: How did he end up in Scotland? HORAN: Well, first his parents went over there when he was a boy and then raised him over in Scotland. SIGRIST: Do you know why they went to Scotland? HORAN: No. SIGRIST: I see. Talk a little bit about, you said your father worked in the iron works... HORAN: The iron works. Well, I can't tell you much about that because I was only five years old when we left Scotland. My mother's health give out so she had to come to Ireland. SIGRIST: What was wrong with her? What was wrong with her? HORAN: Heart trouble. SIGRIST: What was her name? HORAN: Her name was Martha. SIGRIST: And what was her maiden name? HORAN: McKenna. SIGRIST: Could you spell that, please? HORAN: M-C-K-E-N-N-A. SIGRIST: Did she, did either your father or your mother have other family in Scotland? HORAN: My mother's people was all in Ireland but my father's father and mother were in Scotland. SIGRIST: They were still in Scotland. HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Do you have any memories of being in Scotland yourself? Do you remember...? HORAN: Yes, I can remember. SIGRIST: Do you remember the house you lived in? HORAN: Yes, it was like an apartment, second floor. I can remember that perfectly well. SIGRIST: Do you remember how the rooms were laid out? HORAN: No, I just remember being there. SIGRIST: Were there other children in the family, when you were in Scotland? HORAN: Yes, there were. My sister, two, two brothers and two sisters were born in Scotland. Just one was born in Ireland. That's my youngest brother John. SIGRIST: What were the names of your other brothers and sisters? HORAN: Dan and Charlie. SIGRIST: And the sisters? The sisters, what were their names? HORAN: Bridget and Matilda. SIGRIST: They were all older than you? HORAN: No, Bridget was the oldest. Then the two boys and then I come in. Then my other sister was younger than me. SIGRIST: What else do you remember about Scotland? Do you remember maybe a holiday celebration of some sort, a Christmas? HORAN: Well, I remember one holiday. We went to, (trying to remember) oh, I can't think of that now, Edinborough, and my uncle was there with his three little children and they were running up and down steps. I was I think about three, three years old, and we turned the corner and I wasn't quick enough to get up and I got lost and I can always remember the policeman picking me up. (she laughs) That kind of sticks in my mind. So he remembered them passing, so then he took, my mother missed me so she came back to get me, so that's all I remember about that. SIGRIST: What did your mother look like? HORAN: Ah, she was supposed to be a very good looking girl when she was young? SIGRIST: Was she tall? HORAN: No, about my height. She wasn't, she was thin. Not heavy. SIGRIST: Did she have dark hair? Dark hair, light hair? (clock chimes) HORAN: Well, kind of brown hair but then, naturally, it got like mine. It got white. (she laughs) SIGRIST: What did Dad look like? HORAN: Oh, my. Just an ordinary man, I guess. He had dark hair but a red moustache. (she laughs) You could notice him from that. And he was a very good father? SIGRIST: Because he worked in the iron industry, was he very muscular? Was he...? HORAN: Yeah, he was a strong man. So, was... SIGRIST: (interrupting her) You say, I'm sorry, go ahead. HORAN: That's about all I know about that. SIGRIST: You say he was a very good father. Was he very good with the kids? HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did he like kids? HORAN: Yeah, he was. SIGRIST: Do you remember going on outing with him or did he play with you? HORAN: We used to, when we were little, every year we went to Ireland for two months. He would take us over and leave us. We would come to my mother's people and then he would come in August and take up back. SIGRIST: What months? HORAN: Well, he would always bring us from home at the beginning of July. The end of August he would come and get us because the others had to go to school, so that's about all I can think about there. SIGRIST: You said that he brought you over to your mother's family in Ireland. HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Talk about her family over there. Talk about your grandparents. HORAN; Well, my grandparents both were old when I remember them. My grandfather was a shoemaker and he was, my grandmother was a very tall person and I don't remember much about them because my grandfather died shortly after we went home to Ireland. SIGRIST: What did he die of? What did he die of? HORAN: Old age. SIGRIST: He was very elderly? HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember, were your grandparents strict people? Were they kind people? Were they strict? HORAN: Yeah, very. Yeah. SIGRIST: Did they ever have to punish you for any reason? HORAN: No, I don't ever remember them, my mother used to wallop us once in a while (she laughs) but my father never hit any of us. SIGRIST: I see. When you were visiting your grandparents, was your grandmother a good cook? HORAN: Yes, she was a good cook. SIGRIST: Do you remember something that she made that you particularly liked? HORAN: Well, they didn't have much fancy cooking over there, you know, but she used to make what they called a "dumpling." It was like a cake and it was very good. Then my mother used to make it when she came by to Ireland. SIGRIST: How do you make that? HORAN: Well, she used to, whatever mix they'd put it in a pillowcase and boil it. SIGRIST: That's interesting. Yeah, was this for a special holiday kind of... HORAN: Yeah, kind of, there were raisins and everything was in it. It was very good. SIGRIST: All right, so you would go to Ireland for two months... HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: And then your father would come and bring you back to Scotland. HORAN: Back to Scotland, yeah. That went on for five, five years and then we came to live in Ireland. SIGRIST: Do you remember moving from Scotland to Ireland? HORAN: No, I don't have much (she clears her throat), I don't have very much mind about that. SIGRIST: I see. So you were five. HORAN: Yeah, I was five and then I went to school in Ireland. SIGRIST: Okay, let's get you to Ireland, then. So the whole family moves to where in Ireland again? HORAN: Derry. County Derry. SIGRIST: So it's you, your mother, your father, two brothers and two sisters. So tell me about where you moved to. What was the house like that you moved to? HORAN: Well, my father had a new house built. (she clears her throat) We had to rent a house while the other house was getting built and then, when it was built, my father then came home and he was a farmer then. That's how he made his living. SIGRIST: I see. Did he have his own fields or did he rent...? HORAN: Yeah, yeah. He had his own land. It was his aunt's and he had bought it off her. She was living there then 'til I come out here. SIGRIST: I see. Where did your father sell his produce? Your father was a farmer, right, so he had to sell his vegetables and things. HORAN: Yes. SIGRIST: Where did he do that? HORAN: Potatoes and corn (she clears her throat) and hay. SIGRIST: How did he sell it? HORAN: Well, he used to (she clears her throat), the potatoes, we eat them (she laughs), naturally. And the corn, he would sell some of it and some of it he'd save, for he had cattle and he would feed the cattle on the hay. SIGRIST: The house that he had built, was that a big farm? HORAN: Well, I don't know how many acres it was. That I couldn't tell you. SIGRIST: Did you keep animals? Did you keep animals? HORAN: Yeah, cows, pigs, chickens, ducks. SIGRIST: Did you have to help take care of these animals? HORAN: Yeah, feed the hens or feed the ducks. SIGRIST: I see. Let's talk a little bit about going to school in Ireland. Did you go to school? HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Talk a little bit about being a little girl and going to school in Ireland. HORAN: Well, I remember when I went to school I wouldn't talk because I had the Scotch accent and the kids used to make fun of me. And then I was a couple of months in school and I wouldn't even open my mouth and I was trying to pick up the Irish talk so as I could talk like them. SIGRIST: Did you do it? HORAN: I did pretty good. (she laughs) SIGRIST: Do you remember any of your teachers in school in Ireland? HORAN: Yeah, Miss Broom. SIGRIST: B-R-O-O-M? HORAN: And Miss McCruery. That's my two, there was the two school teachers. SIGRIST: Why do you remember them? HORAN: I don't know why, but I do remember them, yeah. SIGRIST: Were you a good student? Were you a good student? HORAN: Yeah, was I? I guess I wasn't too bad. SIGRIST: In school, what was your favorite subject? HORAN: Reading was mostly, and I liked to write a lot. I don't do much writing now. SIGRIST: No. Did you ever learn anything about America in school? HORAN: Well, yeah. They had a map there and you could see the different parts. But I always felt America, you didn't have to work. You just got the money for nothing. (she laughs) So I found out different. SIGRIST: Indeed. I wanted you to describe the house that your father built for you. HORAN: Well it had, them days there were no bathrooms. (she clears her throat) We had an outhouse. And there were three bedrooms upstairs and a living room and kitchen downstairs. SIGRIST: Talk about the kitchen a little bit. Talk about the kitchen a little bit. HORAN: Oh, the teacher? SIGRIST: The kitchen. HORAN: Oh, the kitchen! SIGRIST: THe kitchen in the house. What kind of stove did it have? HORAN: It had, uh, the fire was on the floor. SIGRIST: Like a fireplace? HORAN: Big fire, yeah, like a fireplace and the fire was right there, yeah. (she gestures) And then in the bedroom and in the living room they had little small, where you could put a fire, like a little grate where you could put fire. SIGRIST: Is that how the house was heated? HORAN: And that's turf. You use turf, and coal. SIGRIST: Was there a coal bin in the house somewhere? HORAN: No. SIGRIST; Did you have your own bedroom in this house? HORAN: Me? SIGRIST: Yes. HORAN: No. There were three of us in the one bedroom. (she laughs) SIGRIST: Did you have to share a bed with somebody? HORAN: Yeah, and then the boys shared... SIGRIST: Which sister did you share the bed with? HORAN: Bridget and Matilda. SIGRIST: I see. Talk a little bit about your sisters. Let's talk about Bridget. What was she like as a person? HORAN: Oh, she was a wonder...,she was a very jolly person, Bridget. She was, she was ninety-six when she died so, uh... SIGRIST: She was a lot of fun when she was a little girl? HORAN: She was. She was very, she was a nice looking girl, very nice. SIGRIST: And what about Matilda, what was she like? HORAN: Matilda, I think she's wonderful. SIGRIST: Were you closer to Matilda than you were to Bridget? HORAN: No, I don't think I was. I was more time with Bridget than I was with Matilda. So I had a letter today from her and she wanted me to come home. SIGRIST: She's still in Ireland. HORAN: Yeah, she's married with two sons. The two sons are married and have family. SIGRIST: Did your family, your brothers and sisters, did everyone get along or did you fight as children? HORAN: Oh, we had our, naturally, every now and then you would have, the boys used to fight with Bridget. Bridget used to bake some bread and they used to steal it on her, so that's where the battle would start. Like, there were fair days in Ireland. My mother and father would always go to the fair, maybe they were selling some cattle. And then Bridget was the head of the house because they were gone. And she used to back what they called "scones" and they used to come in and steal them. So naturally there was a battle over the bread. But they were very good. They were two good boys. Dan came out here in 1912. Charlie, he married in Ireland. He never came out, yeah. SIGRIST: I see. You said your mother and father went to the fair to buy cattle... HORAN: No, to sell cattle. SIGRIST: Was there a fair like once a year or...? HORAN: No, once a month they had a fair. SIGRIST: Can you describe the fair a little bit? HORAN: Yeah. They had it in a place called "Maghara." SIGRIST: Could you spell that please? How do you spell? HORAN: M-A-G-H-A-R-A, Maghara. SIGRIST: And what was the fair like? HORAN: Well, they had pigs and they had sheep and cows and been a lot going on in the fair, you know, in fair day. SIGRIST: Did you used to go to the fair? HORAN: Well, not very often, not very often. SIGRIST: I see. Let's talk a little bit about religious life. What were you religiously? HORAN: Catholic. SIGRIST: Catholics. Was there a church in this town? HORAN: Yeah. The church was about three miles from where we lived. We used to have to walk to church back and forth. SIGRIST; What was the name of the church? HORAN: Uh, oh, Saint Patrick's of Glen. SIGRIST: Of Glen? HORAN: Glen, yeah, Saint Patrick's of Glen. And it's still there. SIGRIST: Do you remember what it looked like on the inside? Was it a big church or a small church? HORAN: No, it wasn't a very big church. It was all changed like when I went home this last time. They had done it over. It was different than it was when I went there. They made it larger. So it was a nice little church. SIGRIST: Was it ornate on the inside when you were a kid? HORAN: Yes. I always thought the altar was on one side and now they have it at the end. They changed the altar over. SIGRIST: I see. Was there a cemetery near the church? HORAN: Yeah, the cemetery was right at the church, yeah. SIGRIST: Now, the town that you moved to, was this the town where your father's, your mother's parents lived? In Derry, when you moved to Derry, is this where your mother's parents lived? HORAN: Yeah. That's where my mother was raised, in Derry. SIGRIST: So did your grandparents live near you? HORAN: No, it was a different town. We were Brockariley and they were, uh, I can't think of the name, it was Baranough, I guess. SIGRIST: How far away was it? HORAN: Oh, it was a couple of miles in distance. SIGRIST: Did you ever, you went and visited them sometimes once you moved? HORAN: Yes, when I moved my grandmother used to come over to visit back and forth. SIGRIST: Did you spend holidays together with your grandparents? Like Christmas, did you all get together for Christmas? HORAN: At Christmas we'd always visit and at Easter we would visit. Or they would come and visit us. SIGRIST: (clock chimes) Did you have a big celebration at Easter time, a special meal of something? HORAN: Oh, naturally, we would have a special meal. I mean, fried chicken, you know, potatoes and a vegetable. SIGRIST: I see. HORAN: Nothing fancy. SIGRIST: (he laughs) Very plain. HORAN: Yeah, plain. SIGRIST: You mentioned earlier that your sister and you sang. Were you a musical family? HORAN: I don't know. (she laughs) SIGRIST: Did your father sing or was he, did he play an instrument? HORAN: No, my mother used to sing, I think, when she was young. SIGRIST: Do you remember all getting together with the family members and singing or playing instruments or anything like that? HORAN: Yeah, we used to play the accordion and my brother Charlie played the violin, so on a Sunday there would be some of the neighbors would come in, you know, they'd have dancing, singing. SIGRIST: Right in the house? HORAN: Right in the house in the kitchen. SIGRIST: It was a big kitchen? HORAN: Well, it was a good size. SIGRIST: How did you prepare for the neighbors coming in? Did you feed them? HORAN: Well, we didn't prepare. They just came in. (she laughs) SIGRIST: I see. Were there lots of neighbors? HORAN: Yeah, we had quite a few neighbors. Ones not far from us. Ones back of us. Then the others was a little distance away, but there a lot there were, about eight or nine families all like in a group. SIGRIST: Did your mother work? HORAN: Before she, uh, before she got married she worked. SIGRIST: But not after she got married? HORAN: Huh? SIGRIST: But not after she was married. HORAN: No, after she was married. Once you get married you don't work over there but now you do. It's entirely different. SIGRIST: You said that in 1912 your brother Dan came to America. HORAN: Yeah, he came out here. SIGRIST: Why? HORAN: Well, I guess there weren't much for him to get work over there, so then he came out here. SIGRIST: What did he do when he got here? HORAN: He worked on the railroad, I think. That's what he did. Then he sent me my ticket to come. SIGRIST: Did you have any other family here in America? HORAN: No. No relatives of any. SIGRIST: So where did he go to live? HORAN: Well, he boarded with someone, this lady, and when we came that's where we came. But we were only three days in the country when we were at war. We got word, the British had got. And in a private house, and I, not far from each other. SIGRIST: When your brother came in 1912, where was the boarding house? Was it in New York City? HORAN: No, Philadelphia. SIGRIST: He went to Philadelphia. HORAN: Yeah, Philadelphia, yeah. SIGRIST: Did he go right to Philadelphia or did he go to Ellis Island and then to Philadelphia. HORAN: I imagine he went to Ellis Island. I really don't know but I imagine he went to Ellis Island, yeah. SIGRIST: I see. How much older is he than you? HORAN: He is, I guess, about three years older than me. SIGRIST: So was he writing letters back and forth? And was he writing to you? HORAN: Yeah, he was writing. And then he said he got lonely so he wanted somebody out so he sent for me. SIGRIST: Was he happy that he was in America? Was he happy that he had come? HORAN: Oh, yeah. Oh, he liked America. SIGRIST: And he wanted you to come over to visit. HORAN: Yeah. And then my mother wouldn't let me come alone. She sent Bridget with me. Otherwise Bridget, would never had been in America. SIGRIST: You said that he sent you your ticket to come over. Were you working in Ireland? HORAN: No. SIGRIST: Because you were a young lady at this point. You were in your teens. HORAN: My mother wouldn't let us. Over there the girls usually was hired out, you know, went to farm houses. But my mother wouldn't let none of us go. SIGRIST: Why? HORAN: I don't know why but she said no. SIGRIST: Did you have responsibilities in the house? HORAN: Well, I really didn't do much work, except maybe feed the hens or something. SIGRIST: You didn't have to make the beds or anything like that? HORAN: Oh, yeah. We all had to do that. Clean up or something like that. I didn't do very much work in Ireland to tell you. I didn't like farming. SIGRIST: Did your father like farming? HORAN: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: He liked it better than working in... HORAN: Well, he had to like it because he had to make a living. SIGRIST: Were you, were the children ever expected to go out into the fields and help him? HORAN: Yeah, yeah, surely. I gathered the potatoes or the hay, yeah. It was a good life. SIGRIST: Hard life. HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did you have to make your clothes or did you buy clothes? HORAN: No, we bought. My mother used to make some of our clothes but otherwise we had to buy them. SIGRIST: I see. There was a store in town? HORAN: Oh, yeah. Maghara. There were a lot of stores. SIGRIST: I see. Well, let's get you to America. So Dan has sent you your passage and you want to come. HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Yes. So, but your mother, you said your mother wouldn't let you come. HORAN: Mother, well, she didn't, she didn't want me to go but when he sent the ticket, so then Bridget came along with me, my sister. And there was a man home from America, a neighbor, and we went back with him. SIGRIST: You went back over with him. HORAN: Yeah, with him. His name was McGlade, Patty McGlade. SIGRIST: If your mother didn't really want you to go, how did you tell that you were going to go? HORAN: Well, that I can't remember. (she laughs) SIGRIST: Was it a secret? HORAN: Well, I, yes. It was supposed to be a secret but when he sent the letter, they got it. SIGRIST: They opened your mail. HORAN: Yeah. Well, they see it was from my brother so they would open it. The ticket was in it. SIGRIST: How did your mother react to that? HORAN: Well, naturally she felt bad. She didn't want to part with us. (she laughs) SIGRIST: Do you remember packing? HORAN: Yeah. We didn't pack very much. SIGRIST: What did you take? HORAN: Just a small suitcase. SIGRIST: What kinds of things did you put in the suitcase? HORAN: Well, just a couple of dresses and skirts, underwear. SIGRIST: Did your mother and father have a sort of "send off" dinner for you or a little party? HORAN: Yeah, had a big dance that night, the night before we left. So they had a big dance for us and all the neighbors came. SIGRIST: Did anyone give you "goodbye" gifts? HORAN: Very little. They didn't have much to give. SIGRIST: Was that sad, saying goodbye to everyone? HORAN: Yeah, I guess it was sad but I said I didn't have sense enough to realize I was leaving, you know, 'til I got out here. Then I realized I missed home, yeah. SIGRIST: Sure. What port did you leave from? HORAN: (she clears her throat) Well, I had to go into Maghara, take a train to Belfast. SIGRIST: Could you spell Maghara for us? HORAN: M-A-G-H-A-R-A, Maghara. SIGRIST: Okay, thanks. HORAN: And then we took a train out to Belfast. And then from Belfast we took a boat over to Queenstown. SIGRIST: Was this the first time you'd ever been on a train? HORAN: Oh, no. I was on the train several times before, coming back and forth from Scotland, you know, we were on a train. And then in Queenstown, that's where we got on the boat, the Lusitania. SIGRIST: And did your parents go with you to Queenstown? HORAN: No, we left, no. My mother didn't go but my father and the rest of the family left me at Maghara. SIGRIST: Do you remember saying "goodbye" to them? HORAN: Yeah. I didn't want them to say "good bye." SIGRIST: How did you feel then? HORAN: Well, I felt sad and yet I didn't realize, you know, you don't realize when you're young what you're leaving behind. SIGRIST: Were you excited to see your brother? HORAN: Yes, yes I was. SIGRIST: So you got on the Lusitania at Queenstown. HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Can you describe the accommodations in the boat? Where did you sleep? HORAN: Well, I call them bunks. They were like, there were four in a room. Two up and two.. SIGRIST: You had your own cabin? HORAN: Yeah. And it had like a wash basin in the room. It was a very nice boat.

I remember I met, there were two, three girls and they came to talk to me and they were from the south of Ireland and they had a very heavy brogue. So I said to them, "I only talk English." They were going to throw me overboard. (they laugh) SIGRIST: Making friends on the boat. HORAN: They were talking English but I didn't know. Yeah they were nice, three nice girls.

And the next day was Labor Day and he was an engineer on the Pennsylvania Railroad and he came back for us so it would save my brother the money and he took us from Ellis Island. But I can't remember how I got to the train from Ellis Island. SIGRIST: What do you remember about Ellis Island? HORAN: I thought it was terrible. They treated you like a bunch of cattle. SIGRIST: Were there lots of people there? HORAN: Yeah, there were like, well, I guess the Irishmen go on one side and the different, you now, the different ones. It was terrible. I thought it was terrible. SIGRIST: What did you think when you saw that big building? HORAN: I didn't like it. (she laughs) SIGRIST: It was very scary. How long were you there? HORAN: That I don't remember. We weren't very, we couldn't be so long. We got off in the morning off the boat. (to her grandson as he comes in the room) Hi, Michael. And then, of course, they checked you out, you know. SIGRIST: How did they do that? HORAN: And then they'd put a tag on you when you get in. I said that's what they do with the cattle. SIGRIST: How did they put the tag on? HORAN: There was like a, (she clears her throat) I don't remember what was on it but they would stick it on your, you know, on your coat or dress, whatever you had on. SIGRIST: When you were going through Ellis Island, did you have your suitcase with you? HORAN: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did they check the suitcase out at all? HORAN: Yeah, uh huh. SIGRIST: What did they do? HORAN: Oh, well, they just opened it and looked at what you had. SIGRIST: I see. Did you eat? HORAN: But I don't remember, now for leaving there I can't remember that. I know we took the train into Philadelphia. SIGRIST: And you went with this American man. He came back to Ellis and waited for you. HORAN: Yeah, he come back, yeah. And then my brother met us there.
