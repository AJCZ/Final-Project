My sister called for me, he says, "No, she want to come, your sister will call for you." And I came, you know. That's how come I came, you know. MATSEN: Now, when you were taking your trip to get to the boat, do you remember? FIORAVANTI: They sent me the paper with, the paper, we already paid for the boat. MATSEN: Oh, okay. So it was already paid for. FIORAVANTI: My sister did that, you know. MATSEN: Now, when you were on the boat, who did you stay with on the boat? You weren't by yourself. FIORAVANTI: With a lady.

The time was October, I can't come yet, because I can't find nobody yet to bring me, you know. Then the real estate, the agency, he went to this woman and this mother, and he went over here and he says, "I got a young girl," he says, "that wants to go to America. Want to take the responsibility to bring her over her to America." You know. She says, "Yes." But she didn't know it was me. We knew her, you know. I didn't know she was coming to America, you know.

"Oh," she says, "didn't you know?" I says, "I didn't know you were going to America." Well, anyway, she says, "Yeah." Right away she says, "Yes." Already she says yes before she sees me, you know. But when we come over here we were the things over here, it was a big step. When we come together, you know. She was in the boat. But when we come over here, it was the things over here. It was a big step. When we come together, you know, like (?) in the boat. She was really up, and I was really down. She says she couldn't breathe downstairs, you know.

You know, because, you know, she didn't know, you know, she think she can get upstairs, but she didn't know what was the boat. Like years ago you don't know everything, you know. Everything that they're doing, you know, never is, you know. MATSEN: Was it a rough ride on the boat? FIORAVANTI: A what? MATSEN: Do you remember, do you remember the boat ride?

And the ticket she give to me, my paper, by then they change it, they change the rule when I reach over here. I can't go nowhere, you know. But then me, I got scared. You know? MATSEN: When you got here you were scared. FIORAVANTI: I come back again, and then the man come and told me, "You have the tickets. We have the tickets in Europe, you know. And he told me where we're going to go, you know. And then I went to the boat. I remember I went to the boat, and then from the boat to the train. Now, when we went to the train there was two young girls with me, two young women. They were going to Pittsburgh. I never forget that day, you know, that night. Now, the boat is (?), me and (?), I think. Because, I don't know, you know, I was alone. Then they was together, you know. And he says to me, he says, "Go sit down." Then the next train, next wagon, I hear singing, my dialect, like where we come from, you know. I said to the man, "I want to go over there." "No," he says, "you have to stay over here." You know, it was two men, these two girls, and me, in this car, this car of the train. Now, I hear singing, singing, you know. I says, "Ooh," I says, "they're singing my dialect." You know. I get up again, and I says, "I want to go over there." "Yeah, yeah, yeah." I make the motion, because there was singing there. "No," he says, "you have to stay over there." You know. Then, when I come out from the train, and I see there's a lot of people come out. Oh, when I see them, it was the same town where I come from, you know. I says, I stood with this girl. They gave me a piece of bread, one fruit, because I brought a basket. Me, I don't know the way, you know. Like when he come out from over here then he go to the train, I don't know nothing, you know. And he says to me, he says, "She give me a piece of bread and one fruit." You know. I says, "It's all right." He says, "No, no." I say, "The American bread was soft, you know." I says, "Ooh, how soft it is." ( she laughs ) And they started to laugh. He says, "This is not Italian bread." You know. And then I come out, it was in the morning. It was in the morning. I didn't see nothing by seven o'clock. All night we travel, you know. Every once in a while the train stop and everything. No, when I come out it was another big stop, Baltimore. And I come over there, and I went to the room, and this colored man come at me. When this man come at me, I went, "No!" Over there I never seen the colored people, where we come from. Now they seen now, you know. And I said, "No!" You know, I have two little, one valise and one small one, you know. And I went back to the, outside to the, where they, everybody comes in, you know.

He says, "Here. Why didn't you come over there?" I says, "The man didn't make me come over there." You know. "Why?" he says. "Nobody over there?" I says, "I don't know. I didn't see nobody." You know. But he was already over here. He knew the way, you know. And he says to me, "Come with me. We'll make the run," and we don't see nobody. Not my sister. My sister, he got the telegram, my sister-in-law did it. He went to the, another people, the same name was them, Baltimore, you know. Now, what happened there, they got this telegram. They didn't know it was my sister, you know. He says, "Somebody make a mistake." You know, because we don't know nobody from Italy, you know. But this man, he says to me, "You come with me." He brought me to another house. This house was all women, and the same town where we come from, you know. And he sit down, he says, "(?)." He says, "Maybe you eat." You know. She went outside. She have a nanny goat. She took the milk. She said to me, "Drink, it's nice and warm." You know, years ago, you know. And I says, "Ooh," I says, "thank you, no." And she give me some biscuit, you know. In the meantime this man went, call my sister, see. And when my sister come he says, "Boy, my," he says, "I don't know.

But the other one, the youngest one, the three that died really in Italy, my brothers, you know. And when I went over there, then the men, the teacher, a few days after, the lady came. I'm supposed to go to school. My brother-in-law says, "No, no school. We go back to New York." You know, because we were supposed to come to New York. Because he says over there was no more work for them, it was (?), you know. When we come over here, I come over there in November, and I was, July we come over here in New York. When I stayed at the sister-in-law's house, then I come to Brooklyn. To Brooklyn we went to, I got married over there in Brooklyn. It's, you know. I met my husband, and we live on 12th Street. Because he belonged in New York, you know. MATSEN: So in Brooklyn you met your husband. FIORAVANTI: Yeah, yeah.

Like my mother, every time say, "When I'm not living," she used to say, "you go to America." Because already two daughters was over here. See, my mother wanted me to stay over there. But that happened a thing different, you know what I mean? And when I went back, my daughter, with a cousin over here, she says, "You want to go back? You're going to go back. Every time we go back we never go back." You know. Then my daughter went to agency, and then agency says, "No, bring your mother over here." This happened twenty-two years ago, and now as I come I went. I went to my cousin's house. The son, the mother and father came here, they want, you know. And I stayed with them, two months. Very nice, all different. More house, more things, you know. They do like over here, you know. The girl, they do like over here, years ago they don't do like that. MATSEN: Right.

Because when I come out from this building, I didn't see nothing. See, when we come in, it was dark. And then when I told you they separate to check you the eyes, they see the paper, you know. They see the paper and they check my eyes, then they take off my clothes, because they have the paper for the doctor over here, I have no sickness, you know.
