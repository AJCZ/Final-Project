GUMB: This is Dana Gumb, and I'm speaking with Mr. Myron Surmach, Surmach, on the 25th day of October, 1985. We're beginning this interview at, uh, 2:40, 1:40, and we're about to interview Mr. Surmach about his immigration experience from the Ukraine in the year 1910, 1910. Okay, all right, Mr. Surmach, if we could begin with your prepared statement, if you'd like to read your statement, or . . . SURMACH: I'd like to say whatever it was, when I came to the United States, because it was exactly seventy-five years ago, and there is not everything in my head left open because maybe something is left out. But, uh, I, I r very well, uh, that I came and, uh, and what kind of day it was and everything. I have a little statement over here, I'll tell you. In July 1910, after twenty-one days on slow boat Atlanta, I came to the United States from the city of Kries, which, at this time, was under Austrian control. Yes, I was sick most of the time on the boat. Only, someone suggested to buy lemon, on which I spent one dollar. the juice from the lemon settled my stomach until we reached Ellis Island. But then I was very scared because I spent a dollar for a lemon, did not have twenty-five dollars, as agent in Ukraine told us, that everybody must have twenty-five dollars to get into the United States. Another big fight I got when we landed on the deck at Ellis Island. There was a black man, which I never saw before. He was showing everybody where to go. When we came to him, we could not understand them. Then we got a big surprise. He spoke to us in good, clear, Ukrainian language. There were, there were about twenty Ukrainians at our, uh, gathering from Galacia on the boat. And the black man was then always around us. He even took us on a small boat to Hoboken and showed us which train to take wherever we're supposed to go. One lady did not pass the examination. Her eyes were bad and she had some kind of disease called glaucoma, or something like that. Uh, and, uh, boy, she cried loud. She almost wanted to jump to the sea. She had a husband in New York, and they did not allow her to see him. That make everybody sad. She was sent back. The rest of, the rest of us pass examination, mostly they look at the eyes, and then they poke on the chest, and so nobody ask how much, nobody ask how much money we have, we should have. After examination, they give us food. I remember I got a big piece of apple pie and a glass of milk. That tasted so good. Then I decided then, right there, that America, America make such a good food, then America is good to go, to come. And I did not make mistake. I still like a, but I go slow on apple pie. ( he laughs ) GUMB: Okay. SURMACH: That's the best I could put together how it was. And, uh, and, uh, really, well, I, uh, I went to Ellis Island after again, I'll show it to you, picture. GUMB: Wait a second. We'll look at it later. SURMACH: See? I used to belong to Ukrainian Chorus. That was not church. That was a private chorus called (?) Ukraine's (?). And we sang on Ellis Island and, I mean, it was 19--, 1906. GUMB: Okay, um, if we could start, just to get a little background, before you came to Ellis Island. Could you tell us where and when were you born? SURMACH: I was born in Galiacoat [ph], that was under Austria at that time, in Galacia. And, well, it's near city of Lwiw, L-W-I-W. Uh, and, uh . . . GUMB: When was this? SURMACH: It was 1893, 1893. And, uh, well, let's see, uh, you don't, you don't want a village. To tell you, that wouldn't be important. Name of village is Zeldec. GUMB: Okay. Could you spell that name, the name of the village? SURMACH: Z-E-L-D-E-C, Zeldec. GUMB: What was life like there? SURMACH: You want the whole story like that? GUMB: Yeah. Some of the, some of the details about what life was like and why you came in the country, why you came here. SURMACH: Well, that, I didn't prepare that. ( he laughs ) I don't know. You can ask me. Well, I think that everybody would want to go somewhere, because it was a really poor country. It was poor managed, you couldn't get no work nowhere, and everybody has to have a couple of acres of land. Let's say, my father had ten acres, so it was not too bad. But still, I remember a lot of days I was hungry. I didn't, mama make some soup and put a little bit, cup of grains in it, and I ate, and that's enough, I know that. So, there, you could make, once in a while, there was a big landlord that has a, what they make beer from, I forget the name . . . GUMB: Barley? Hops? SURMACH: Hops, yeah. And, we used to work there summertime when we were young. What we paid, we got fifty cents a day, and so that was not much. But, uh, my brother went to Prussia the first year, my mother was forty years old. He went to Prussia. And then he came back and, and find out that people go to America. So next year he went to America. And when he got here, then he wrote to, to, that I should come after him. And, so . . . GUMB: What did he say about America? SURMACH: He, well, he just like it. Only trouble is, he went back because he had a girlfriend in the Ukraine. He wanted to marry her, and he went back. And that was 1913. And then Austria got him into the Army because war started 1914, and he got injured, and he, and he died later. So I was always missing him and dream about him. GUMB: When, when you were in the Ukraine, uh, did you hear other things about America? Did you hear other stories about what was here? SURMACH: Well, we just know that this is good, that you could make money. We didn't think nothing about freedom. We didn't care about freedom. You wanted dollars. ( he laughs ) So, I didn't, I don't know nothing about freedom, just to make money. I know that I could make money . And when I come to this country, and, uh, next day, I went to the Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. The next day I went to the shop, by the shop, and a man called me inside, and I got the job of picking up springs. They used to make springs for carriages, there was no horses, for horse carriages, there was no automobiles yet. And, uh, so I got first pay seven dollars. About a dollar and a quarter a day. And that was not too much for here. But when I counted, for Austrian money, it was fifty kroner. And I was really, I thought myself, I am rich, I make fifty kroner which I would have to work in Austria, over there, fifty days. ( he laughs ) GUMB: I'm wondering, going back to the Ukraine, let's go back, going back to the Ukraine for a minute, you said your father had ten acres, and it sounds like a pretty big farm. But he couldn't make a living? It wasn't worth it? SURMACH: Well, eh, uh, we, mama, mama was raised by rich people. Mama was not from rich family, but her mama, mama's grandmother was, married rich people. So my mother was raised with the rich people. So we get a lot of food from them, so and everything. But you couldn't make, on ten acres, especially if you would, could, you know, take care of everything, all right. But my father, I think he was a little bit careless. Whenever he had a little money he would drink, he'd come home drunk. ( he laughs ) So that's why mama was not very happy. But I never heard that there could be some kind of divorce or something, there was no such thing. GUMB: Did you hear about America in school? SURMACH: Uh, no, no, no, because that was, uh, I was already ten, twelve, I just went to school about two-and-a-half years. So I was seven to nine, I didn't hear nothing about America, no. But after, well, nobody except my brother was already in Prussia. Because, you see, first Germans came to America, then Slavic, Slavic people, Hungarians, so, and then comes to the Carpathian Mountains. Somehow they, the Ukrainians come last because it's, because we didn't know nothing about none of this. It comes south, or whatever it is. GUMB: How do you suppose, how did that happen? How did the word spread, like? SURMACH: That was spread because, uh, people was in America, then they wrote to the family that it is good, and the family tell another family. 1909, or 1908, my father, there was agent to go to, agent take everybody to go to Brazil. Not to America, to Brazil. There was agency, I think they got commission for that. And they, and they, in our village about two, three families decide to go to Brazil. They were selling it, and they, and my father decided to go to Brazil, too. And they saw, I was very happy that we're gonna go somewhere because neighbor's family was going, there was a girl, which I played with her all the time when I took care of the cows. She had one cow, and I had two, three cows, and we played. So when she was going, and I was very happy, I go to Brazil. but then came one man that he moved from another village, some kind of, into our house in the evening, and then started to talk about Brazil. Something he knew. He says, "That's terrible country. It's hot." People get worms in their body." Oh, he was telling so bad that mama said, decided, "I will not go to Brazil." And my father says, "Well, we already sold, we got a deposit." "Give them deposit back, give them double, because we will not go." So, and I didn't go. I didn't go to Brazil. 1909. But 19--, but my brother went to Prussia and when he come back, and he knew about America, and he went to America. And my uncle, too. GUMB: Why did your brother go to America? SURMACH: A year before me, before me, 1909. GUMB: Why did he go? Why . . . SURMACH: Because it's better than Prussia. I mean, he heard, people tell. That's what it is, you know. It spreads. People, neighbors, tell what to do. And then, always, you go to city, and you buy a ship card, that's all, because . . . GUMB: You buy your what? SURMACH: Ship card. Ship card. GUMB: Shift . . . SURMACH: Ship card. That means passage on a ship. GUMB: Oh, ship. Ship card. SURMACH: Yeah. GUMB: Ship cards. Um, well, um, so the, um, whole family, after you decided that you weren't going to go to Brazil, the whole family decided to go to America? SURMACH: No. Just the brother, no, no . . . GUMB: Just your brother. SURMACH: Because America, I don't know why, I don't know what it was. No family went to America. GUMB: You went alone. SURMACH: Yeah. Well, there was some people on the ship, too, but we . . . GUMB: But no family members. SURMACH: No, no family. I went alone. GUMB: And you don't know why your other, why your father and your mother . . . SURMACH: I don't know. Because, uh, they decided to stay. Well, see, they was not educated. Father didn't, Mama knew, went to school a little bit, know how to write. She teach me in Ukrainian, otherwise I studied German and Polish in one year. And . . . GUMB: So your brother, uh, sent back this letter saying, "Come to America." SURMACH: I am sending you, he sent me, he bought, I mean, he was working here, he sent me the ship card. GUMB: Right. SURMACH: He sent it to me, because to get twenty-five dollars mama had to sell the cow, because she sent me just, he sent me the ship card, to go. 'Cause we didn't have money. Of course, we had to, to go to America, nobody was going from us. GUMB: So, um, when you got this, uh, word from your brother that he wanted you to come and he, did, uh, did you hesitate, was there any . . . SURMACH: No, no, I didn't. I like my brother, and, uh, he was a miller before, and he was, uh, he was four years older, so, uh, and, uh, he brought me from Prussia an accordion, so I liked him very much when he brought it. I go to, I walk to him. ( he laughs ) GUMB: How about your parents? How did they feel? SURMACH: They was glad that I go with the brother, and brother already tell him, they want to help children, they don't want to stay home. Nobody stayed home because there is no, nothing. GUMB: Okay. So, uh, to come to America what, what kind of procedures did you have to go through in Europe, what did you have to do? SURMACH: Well, nothing. Except, I went to, to get passport, you know. So, he didn't want to give it to me, passport. He says, "Well, you're seventeen years old, you have to go to Army." And I said, "But I have already ship card. My brother is in America. I want to go." And he says, "You know what, you chop wood for me and I'll see what I can do." And then he gave it to me, a two years visa, fifteen years. And I chopped wood . . . GUMB: Who was this that . . . SURMACH: It was village secretary. Village has a president, or whatever it is, and a secretary. That was secretary. He gives a, for government he was working. He's responsible for people to go to the army, and collect taxes and everything. GUMB: So all you had to do was just chop wood for a day? SURMACH: That's it. Chop ( he laughs ) that's right. And, on some passports I have it that I was born in 1895, but really 1893 I was born. GUMB: Why was there a mistake? SURMACH: No mistake except I, he didn't want to let me, seventeen years old, you can't go to America. You have to go to Army. Seventeen, eighteen, eighteen. But seventeen, so, and I wanted to go ask him, and then he said all right, and I came fifteen, two years younger. GUMB: So you didn't have to go to the Army. SURMACH: No, I didn't go to the Army. To Austria, and the war started in 1914, I was lucky to come now. GUMB: So that was a good deal, chopping wood. ( they laugh ) so, did you have to go to the American officials over there? Did you have to see the American consulate officers? SURMACH: No. No, nothing. You just had a paper, you go, uh, by train, to the, to the ship, I don't know, have ID. GUMB: So, all you had to do was get the train to Trieste. SURMACH: To Trieste. And then a boat to America. That's American only over here. If they don't like you or something they send you back . But if they like you they pass, you'll see. That's all right. They examine, if you're healthy, America took everybody, I suppose at that time, especially from Austria, from Germany. GUMB: I think you mentioned, at the beginning you mentioned an agent, uh, some kind of agent . . . SURMACH: Oh, yeah. Well, there could be, to, uh, well, agents I know there was a lot of propaganda to go to Brazil. But I mention agent, maybe it was just people. GUMB: Yeah, you mentioned the, uh . . . SURMACH: Because they were talking. I don't know, I don't remember who it was, but I know that, oh, some people, there was a man that came back from America, maybe he was telling. I don't know. But anyway, I remember that I had to have the twenty-five dollars. GUMB: Right. Somebody had told you twenty-five dollars. SURMACH: Yeah. GUMB: Okay. So, um, by the way, was this the first, that train trip to Trieste, to get the boat. Was that your first trip away from home? SURMACH: First trip. Yeah. The rest, I was, the rest that I ever saw was the horses. GUMB: Was it the first train? SURMACH: And one, and one day, when I went, mama give me to school in the city half a year, I was six months. After six months in school in the city I came home for Christmas and father said, "You're not gonna go to school any more. You're going to go to Grandmother, the rich people, to take care of the cows." ( he laughs ) And I didn't go. So, one time I, a man had an oxen, and he was in the city, and I worked with him. One time, that I still was, that's only thing, in our village, that man had two oxen and he, instead of horses. It was very slow moving. But I, that's what, American, eight miles, and ten miles. GUMB: What was this walk, from where? SURMACH: From the city to my home. GUMB: When I was in school. SURMACH: Oh, when you were in school. SURMACH: I was in the school. I was six months in the school in the city. I went third, third class, but I was only six months, yes. GUMB: How, how did you get from your village to the train to go to Trais, do you remember? SURMACH: Well, uh, no, I don't remember. But, uh, you had to go to city about one mile, one mile, a meter, Ukrainian mile, I mean. It's about, American, about eight miles. Everybody walked there. Everybody. I didn't, I had a little, two small valises. I had a little books in one valise, and another small one. And, so, I think mother went with me to city, to this city, Kamyamka [ph]. And then I take a train over there to, to Trieste. GUMB: You were taking books, you took books to America? SURMACH: Oh, yeah, I had some school books and prayer books and something like that. I had some, I could read already, because I went to three years of school Ukrainian. GUMB: How many, you just had two bags that you were carrying? SURMACH: Two small ones. Two small valises. That's it. GUMB: Were there any kind of other special possessions that you were bringing to America, any special things that you wanted to bring? SURMACH: No, just, uh, just for a, just books and clothes and a shirt and pants. GUMB: Did you think you'd ever come back? SURMACH: Oh, sure. Everybody, everybody goes to America to make money and come back. They still do that. They still take, nobody goes, even now, one, one Ukrainian lady went back, it's under Poland, that section now, and she was there, and she comes back, and she says, "You know, I go back to die over there," she's older. I say, "Oh, what's wrong?" "Oh, my family there, sister, something," she says. "Over here I'm alone." So, now, they, people like with the family, together. And in the family, they want to stick together. So, in the, nobody. So they, except from Russia, yes. From Communist, they, Communist, they, well, in Poland is a Communist, but still, it's different, it's not so bad. GUMB: Okay. So, um, uh, you, um, described a little bit about the, uh, voyage coming over to this country. Do you remember what class you were traveling in? SURMACH: Oh, third class, of course. ( he laughs ) With everybody. And on a boat, I mean, everybody on the bottom, and, so you could see, not one room, everybody, oh, that was third class. GUMB: What did you sleep on? SURMACH: Well, I don't know. Something. I know it was a double bed. I was on top. And a, well, just, a mattress, a board, over a . . . GUMB: Do you remember anything about the food on the boat? SURMACH: Well, uh, I know, I eat first one day, and the next day I got sick. I could hardly eat. Twenty-one days we used to go, and I'd hardly eat anything. Because one, I mean, about three days before, I got lemon. So then I, I just got, first, good food when I landed here. They had something else, but I got just pie and milk. GUMB: What was the, do you remember what sort of other people were on the boat? What kind of other people were on it? SURMACH: Well, uh, I, there was all nationality, of course. Czechs and Hungarians, but we didn't sit with them. We had, we just stick together with the Ukrainians, you know. There was about twenty people Ukrainians. GUMB: Were there other people from your village? SURMACH: No. GUMB: You met some of these other Ukrainians. Okay. All right, as, um, as you were approaching land, as you were approaching the new country, do you remember your first impressions coming into the new country? SURMACH: No, you couldn't have, I couldn't remember impressions. I just, uh. GUMB: Coming into New York Harbor, do you remember what your first . . . SURMACH: Well, I know it was a nice day. It was July. I remember that. Was nice day. And, uh, as usual, you know, you went, you wanted how the boat gets into it. And then you keep together with the other people to find out, to know where to land. I don't, you can't, I can't think of any special thing that I could remember because it's so long ago, and I just, just like I see it now, like I would be now, when you go on a boat, you just wonder where it's gonna land and the houses. Even now you look. I go to New York and I look, and I forgot if I saw that before or not. GUMB: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? SURMACH: No, I don't remember that. I was thinking hard to remember the Statue of Liberty. I didn't. I maybe saw it, or must saw it, but I didn't think of it. I just think how to get to, to my brother. And when that black man was talking Ukrainian, so I was, I don't know who it was. He was maybe, he come from, I don't know how (?), but we was very surprised, and we like him, and everybody was, and he just took care of us. GUMB: You mentioned, uh, uh, buying lemon, a lemon on the boat? SURMACH: On the boat. Yeah. There was a special. They were selling it. I don't know. Not in the office. GUMB: Was it, I was just wondering, what were, I mean, you say, spend a dollar for a lemon, was it using American money on the boat? SURMACH: Yeah. GUMB: Do you remember if you had American money? Did your brother send you American money or what? Do you remember? It's kind of a small point. Do you remember anything about that? SURMACH: ( he laughs ) Maybe they had changed it. Maybe we changed the money. Because maybe that was, maybe that, maybe that agent from, exchanged. They make some money on it. I think that's, I think so. I think that we had the dollars already. GUMB: You had the dollars. SURMACH: Oh, yeah. GUMB: Do you remember changing money on Ellis Island? SURMACH: No, I don't remember. I had twenty-five, twenty-four dollars. I don't. I think I change it in Trieste. GUMB: This is the end of side one. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO GUMB: This is the beginning of side two. Okay, um, we were talking about the vessel, your vessel coming into New York Harbor. Do you have any memory of where it docked, where the vessel docked, and how you got to Ellis Island? SURMACH: It's, it's, it's, I would think that it's docked in Ellis Island, right there. GUMB: Okay. All right. That's what you remember? SURMACH: That's what I think, I don't think we went, we went, we landed somewhere else and went to the Ellis Island, just right there somewhere. GUMB: All right. So when you, when, you, uh, landed on Ellis Island, what was the first thing that happened? Do you remember, what was the first thing? SURMACH: Well, the first thing that happened, you're supposed to stay in the line, within the line. And there was a lot of people in a couple of lines, you know. And then, of course, you shake if you're gonna pass, and then you take the shift off, and, uh, and so, so you didn't look for nothing else. But, uh, that's the only, remember that you was afraid to pass because that's just like to die. You didn't have money, and they send you back. That was very scary. You couldn't think of nothing else. Just to get to the, to pass. But then, you was happy. You was in America. GUMB: Um, you mentioned the, uh, a little bit about the medical exams. Uh, do you remember any details about what they looked at on you, or how long it took, how long the exam took? SURMACH: Well, they looked good in the eyes. They looked on everybody. We was surprised why they want to, but we already know that there is some kind of disease that spreads, and then they don't let nobody go with that kind of disease. That's most important. And then, when they take shirt off, they knock on your chest and back and, uh, that's all. They just let you do it, and okay, you pass to the right. And, uh, if it's not, I suppose you would be passed to the left. But, uh, we saw the lady that, uh, that they told her. The other lady, she said no, to the left. And then she start to cry because they told her, I think maybe the black man told her that she can't go. And, uh . . . GUMB: Where was the black man? SURMACH: On Ellis Island. GUMB: Yeah, right, but, uh, he was . . . SURMACH: He was right in front of the, of our, of our group. GUMB: Oh, he was with the group? SURMACH: He was in the front. GUMB: He was leading the group? SURMACH: Our twenty Ukrainians. GUMB: And they were all from the same boat. SURMACH: From the same boat, yeah. And, uh, and, uh . . . GUMB: Did you have any idea who he worked for, or what . . . SURMACH: Well, I know it's for America. That's already. Everybody looked to me different. Big, and voices like "whooo," like that. I know it, I know that it's different than the, than the Ukraine. But to me it was surprising, scary like. Everything. It's small. GUMB: The black man. Did you know who he worked for? SURMACH: No. I don't know. I think for the, for the Ellis Island. GUMB: For Ellis Island. SURMACH: Oh, yeah. He was for Ellis Island. GUMB: Did he have a uniform? SURMACH: I suppose maybe hat or something. I don't remember really. GUMB: Okay. Do you remember anything about the questions that, after the medical exam, do you remember anything about questions, what kind of questions the . . . SURMACH: No questions, except what we asked the man, the black man, then he tell us. No questions. They didn't have no questions, because we wouldn't, no one had to answer in foreign language. GUMB: Well, the black man was the interpreter? SURMACH: He interpreted, he was it. GUMB: Did he ask you questions, the black man? SURMACH: No questions, no questions. No, no, just told us what to do. He said, "Stay in line." He said, "Go in there and write your, go to the boat," and so on. GUMB: This big space here, you know, the Great Hall, do you remember what happened there, what took place there? SURMACH: Well, this, like this one here. Looks a lot of people, lines. There. Oh, that's exactly, looked like that. See, lot of lines, and the people, and there each one examines. ( referring to a photograph ) GUMB: So the black man led the group in here? SURMACH: Well, we had the line like that, and the black man was in the front, after. He was with somebody else, but after somehow he came to ours, of course, we couldn't do nothing. I suppose they had every, every language, I suppose Slavic would be, Hungarians would be there, I think they everyone because they need to be, to go to the boat, and what kind of train to take, that's very important, otherwise you wouldn't know how to get. GUMB: Did somebody ask to look at your passport? SURMACH: Well, I suppose so. But I don't remember. I don't remember. GUMB: Okay. All right. Then, um, once, once it was over, once the examinations were over, and the interrogation was over, uh, do you remember where you went on Ellis Island, what, uh, what area? You mentioned that you had some food to eat. SURMACH: Yeah. GUMB: What did they take you to another room, or, did they take the group to another room, or . . . SURMACH: Yeah, I suppose. Not far, because, yeah, I don't know. Yep. I, I . . . GUMB: It was close to the Great Hall? SURMACH: Yeah. It's, it's in the almost next room, almost next room, b right, to the left, over there. No, I don't see it in picture there. GUMB: Do you remember what that room looked like were you, where you had the apple pie? SURMACH: Well, just like a kitchen and tables, just a restaurant, like a regular restaurant. GUMB: Did you have to pay for the apple pie? SURMACH: No. No nothing. Nothing pay. GUMB: Could you have gotten something else, or they just gave it to you? SURMACH: Well, I didn't know, some man said, some other man told me, I was talking to him, and he said that he come at night, evening. And then they eat frankfurters, that's the first time he ate, and everything, and they sleep there, they had made a hotel right in the office, right in the, I mean, in the building, Ellis Island. They had a room, they had hotel, they sleep there. Because he came, small, with the mother, and he remembers that, they didn't go out, because the ship came late. GUMB: So how much time do you think you spent on Ellis Island all together? SURMACH: Oh, not long. Maybe two hours, three hours. Because we, how long, this was, Wilkes Barre the same day. GUMB: And where did you meet your brother? SURMACH: Right in the, on the depot there. And we had to walk about two miles to the, so we didn't take no streetcar, nothing. We walked because we wanted to talk. ( he laughs ) GUMB: Oh, you met him in Wilkes Barre? SURMACH: Wilkes Barre in the depot. Train came, so he was there waiting already. I don't know how he, I don't know how he know it. I must have written that I gonna come, and somehow he knew it. He was waiting there for me. GUMB: Well, how did you get from Ellis Island to Wilkes Barre? SURMACH: Well, black man took us on a boat, small boat, to Ellis, to Hoboken. In Hoboken he show us the train, which train goes to Wilkes Barre, and we sat there, and that's all. GUMB: Was there a group of people? SURMACH: No, somebody was going further up, Hazelton, something like that, with the same train. GUMB: Oh, the black man took you by yourself? SURMACH: No, I mean, we all went to, to the boat, to the train, we all went. GUMB: Oh, I see. SURMACH: We all went. GUMB: To Hoboken. SURMACH: But not to Wilkes Barre. The same train goes to other towns. GUMB: I see. SURMACH: Hazelton, Bethlehem, something like that. There was Ukrainians all over. GUMB: While you were going through Ellis Island do you remember tags, having a tag on or anything, or . . . SURMACH: Ahhh . . . GUMB: Small point. SURMACH: I don't remember. I don't remember how they recognized. Well, anyway, we stuck together, we was together in the lines. I didn't, we didn't, I didn't run around to, to have a, not to get lost or something. We just, I don't think so. We don't need a tag or something. I don't know. GUMB: So, when, when you arrived in, uh, Wilkes Barre, did you start working, or did you go to school or what? SURMACH: Oh, I start working. GUMB: Seven, you were seventeen, right? SURMACH: Yeah. I was there next day. Next day I went to the shop and I got the job right away. GUMB: How did you get the job? SURMACH: I ran by the shop, spring shop. There was a hundred people waiting, stay in the line. I mean, in a bunch, by the gate, you know. And the man comes out, he looks, "Hey, you, come on." And then they picked me, he picked me up, to pick up springs. GUMB: You mean these were all people waiting for jobs? SURMACH: Yeah. GUMB: Why did he pick you? SURMACH: Well, I suppose I was young, and that kind of job that I could do it and I looked pretty strong, I suppose. And that kind of job that only boys would do it, not, old men, they, they were sharpening, on the stones, and, or by fire, put it. This one was coal shop that I went around, uh, tables and pick up the springs. GUMB: Was it, uh, what were some difficult things about adjusting to the new country? Were there any, did you have any problems adjusting? SURMACH: Well, uh, the worst thing was that, uh, springs was sharpened on these, on the stones, with soda. And soda, I, I pick the spring, this bowls, and my hands were all the soda. So, when I come home, it dry up, and then bust, the spring bust, and that was very hard, it was painful. But I joined the church, chorus, I joined chorus, and every Sunday went to church. I worked seven days a week, six days, from eight to ten, from eight to six. I worked ten hours. GUMB: There were a lot of Ukrainians in that area? SURMACH: Oh, yeah. I went to church. They had a, a, a couple, two, three, five hundred, there was Wilkes Barre, Plains, Parsons, about three different towns belonged together. GUMB: Did, uh, was it hard learning English, or did you have to learn English? SURMACH: Well, I had a, I had a friend, uh, that we went to, the father sent him to school instead of to work. And he was, he was in a high school in Wilkes Barre, and then he belonged to our society, to our church, and then, he was my friend, I teach, I told him to teach us, both my brother and other, and he teach us. But I pick up quicker than my brother. I was, I was, I pick up pretty quick. Not good, still not good, but I didn't have trouble much with the language. GUMB: Um, did you have problems with food, with adjusting to the new food or, at all? SURMACH: I was very happy and, uh, and, uh, we used to live in a house. Let's see, four, three rooms, two rooms, five rooms, but small rooms. And there was nine borders, and a Mrs., and a lady, and a man, just married. So nine, eleven people in the rooms. And, uh, the lady, the man, everybody was working, and the lady used to buy food for us and cook for us. And that cost us seven, three dollars and, no, uh, board is three dollars, you paid three dollars a month for living then. And she would wash, she would wash clothes, and she would wash your back when you would come from work. ( he laughs ) And, uh, and, uh, and, uh there was no, uh, uh, shower or nothing. Just, had a curtain, and a big veil, big pot, she heat the water. What do you call that? Tub? She heat the water, and then, and then you go wash, you tell her, "Go wash, Myron." And the first time, so I taught myself, I went there, put the curtain, washed myself. "Are you ready? I want to wash your back?" I told myself. "My goodness!" And she's young. She's just married. I still had pants on. So she came and washed my back, and then she said, "All right, then you finish yourself." ( he laughs ) GUMB: She was the Ukrainian lady? SURMACH: Ukrainian. Oh, sure. Everybody Ukrainian. And, uh, and then she used to buy food and cook. And then the mouth they count, how much was it, how much she spent, money, and it come out, for nine of us, about seven dollars a month. And, uh, so we pay it, and she was all right because she made about twenty-seven dollars a month, that's big money, from three dollars, from, she didn't get no problem. And she eat free, and her husband, at no charge. GUMB: How, how long did it take before you felt like an American, before you felt like you were really American? SURMACH: Uh, uh, I forgot, I think, oh, yeah. Over there I was going to back country. But when I come to New York, oh, I lost a job because Ford start to make cars and they didn't need no more carriages for the horses. So the shop almost discontinued. So I lost the job. So I wrote to a boy in New York, he was in Wilkes Barre, but he came to New York, he was my friend. I wrote him if I could come, if he had a job for me. He says, "Well, there's five million people, and there's room for you." So I come, I come to New York, and, uh, I started to, well, he show it to me, that he was work in the restaurant, dishwasher, so that's what I'm supposed to, then. But I, when I got a job in a restaurant in Brooklyn, and at night, night work, pick up the dishes, busboy. And I got a big coat, white coat, and I got dressed and hat. Oh, I was so proud, I look in the, I stood by the window, and I told myself, "Oh, the girls from (?) could see me, I have a uniform." ( he laughs ) GUMB: So you started to feel like an American in New York? SURMACH: Well, in New York I started, then I applied for a, but, uh, let's see, that was 1910, 1913 I came, and 1916, well, I joined the, joined the society, Gymnastics Society, the other ten of us went to Czech, Czechoslovakian, you know, we went to them because they had a hall that they were exercising, you know. So we went there. And 1918 I, I was, as I told you, I brought the books, and in Wilkes Barre, already, I went to, there was a Ukrainian bookstore in Scranton, so I went and bought some books and, uh, and was selling to people at the shop, the print shop. And then I come to New York so I did the same thing, then I opened store and I, no. First I used to buy pants for athletic boys, for them, uniform, you know, for gymnastics. And then I start to sell the books and I opened a store in 1918. GUMB: You visited Ellis Island in 1916? SURMACH: 1916. I belonged to, when I still was working in the restaurant, I belonged, over there, to that society, to sing, you know, the chorus. Because I, I was in New York, in the Wilkes Barre I belonged to the church and I sang there in the chorus. So I joined this one. GUMB: This was the Ukrainian chorus? SURMACH: Oh, yeah. And then, and then I got different job, I had more time. Because, you know, we worked in that restaurant, at that time, at least ten hours every day. GUMB: Do you remember how your impression of Ellis Island, when you visited it in 1916, compared to when you were passing through there? SURMACH: Well, it was, uh, no. Well, it's a big hall, that impression, there was a lot of people, and, uh, dense, I mean, it's a, it's a concert, that's all. They were sitting, nothing special. But, of course, it's a big thing, you know, you go anywhere. I was, I was last week over here in Carnegie Hall. Same thing. Ukrainian, yeah, with the Ukrainian concert. GUMB: All right, can I ask about, how long did, when did you become a citizen? SURMACH: Well, 1918, 1917 I would come here, 1917 I came. GUMB: What did, what did you have to do to become a citizen? SURMACH: Well, you just applied. I don't know. Somebody helped me to, I think there was a Kowbasiuk agent on 10th Street, and he does everything. GUMB: What was that, Coper . . . SURMACH: Kowbasiuk. GUMB: What's that? SURMACH: He's still there. K-O-W-B-A-S-I-U-K. Kowbasiuk. GUMB: What does that mean? SURMACH: That's the name of the man that has the agency, has the agency that did everything. Sells ships cards, sells insurance, sells everything. GUMB: Oh, oh, it's a name, just a name of somebody. SURMACH: And he does it. He's still there. He died, but his daughter is there taking care of it. And he makes the paper. He helped us. GUMB: For a citizenship. SURMACH: He did everything. GUMB: How does it feel to become a citizen? SURMACH: I don't know. You feel proud. You like America, but you're still Ukrainian. ( he laughs ) I don't know. I couldn't exactly, I couldn't explain, because I like, I am very proud of the children, my daughter is an artist, very good, very good American, everything, but she's does everything Ukrainian. And my son went to the navy and was three years in the navy, came back, and he didn't want to do store, I told you, he didn't want it. But he came back, he look around, all right, I'll step in your shoes, and he took over. And I"m very proud of it, that he does. He talks Ukrainian, he writes Ukrainian, and same thing my daughter. But the grandchildren, no good. I mean, my one grandson, my daughter's son, his father was a famous writer, but he died, and now he's also artist, painter. He makes a thousand dollars a day. ( he laughs ) He says I'm going to go to the store to sell five cents paper or something and . . . GUMB: What did, I'm sure that you have a lot of customs that you brought from the Ukraine and that you still practice here. What are some of the important ones that you still . . . SURMACH: Well, I still import, now my son take over, I don't, one thing I am picky about over here, take care of the business over here. And, uh, and I have the store. I go Sunday and Tuesday every day, every week, twice a week because I want to see the people and I want to help my son, because if I wouldn't help him I don't think he would be stick, sticking with it. Because, you know, it's a small thing. But he can't help it. He works, but he can't hire nobody, because everybody wants five, six dollars an hour, and you can't have this. Easter eggs, they're selling, you know, small things, you don't make that much money. So I, he's very busy, and I think, I worry about him, because he's not physical nature like me, and he eats what he wants, what he likes and he takes sandwiches and pie and I'm, I'm, I want to live to seventy years more. GUMB: How about at Christmas time? Are there certain things that you do today that you did in the Ukraine? SURMACH: Yeah. I did. We especially, but I didn't sell puccia, that means wheat with poppy seeds and honey. This is specialty. And, uh, so, one, my wife taught me to peel the wheat. So, in old country there was an instrument that they peeled the wheat. Over here we don't know where. And I made it too in the store. I had a store already, and I was peeling that wheat. Wheat, you know, shelled, take the shell out. And one lady came, and said, "Oh, you do that? Make it for me?" So, and I started, some man, I tell him to do it. Then I find out, my relative was in Buffalo, that they had a mill that they could do it. And now we are selling hundreds of pounds now, because we are getting ready-made from the mill. That's one. That's for Christmas. And Easter egg also, called pissanka. I, I started same thing. One man brought me couple eggs to store, 1920. And, uh, I put on the window, just to show people, because nobody was selling it. In the Ukraine, the girls were painting eggs, designs, love on it, prosperity, and luck, and everything's on it, supposed to be the symbols. And then they give, they meet, they go to church on Eastertime and give it to the boys. And the boys take home from lot of girls, maybe half a dozen, something. Looks at it, which one is nicer, and they decide, parents, mother decides, how this one, which is the nice one. "Who made it?" "Oh, that girl from the corner over in the village." You better see her because she's the smartest one, she knows well. So that was a system of girls advertising themselves. They didn't go over here to ball, they didn't know that, they didn't need to. They meet in the church once a week. So, they couldn't go and talk right away. And Easter they could. And now I started to sell first one, and my daughter started, started to study, and she wrote a book, booklet. She made it, I have a sample, what it means. And I put it on my window, and New York Magazine, Mr. Ross, was passing through and saw me, and he saw that article, what she made it. And he come to the store and said, "Can I have a copy of it?" I said, "Sure." Then I showed everything, I give it to him, and next day, on Sunday, I come to store, there were half a dozen women in fur coats waiting to open store. I say, "What do you want?" "Oh, didn't you read in New York Magazine, Talk of the Town, there is something about that you make on eggs, luck, love and prosperity, everything, on eggs? We want to see that." And now, my son is taking care day and night to send out samples of it, the design, how to do it, and dyes and powder. Everything. Big business. And I started. First egg I saw myself, and some women started to make it. And now Americans in school teaching how to do it. And I started this 1920. One egg I saw. First one. Before they never saw. They supposed to bless it in the church and give as present. But now it's quite a business. So this one here I started myself. A lot of things I did, that. GUMB: How do you, just a final question. How does it feel to be an American? SURMACH: Well, let's see. How it feels to be American. That's a question I wish I could answer the right way. As I told you, I feel proud that I am in this country, and I believe that this country is the most free than any other country. There is no chauvinist (?), nobody doesn't care what nationality you are. Because if you would be in another country, like Poland or Russia, you have to be that Russian, otherwise you would be kicked out or . . . GUMB: This is the end of the interview
