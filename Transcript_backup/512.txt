SEAGRESS: Good afternoon this is Paul Seagress for the National Parks Service. Today is Thursday August 23rd 1995. I’m in upstate New York in Latham with John Flubacher. Mr. Flubacher came from Germany in 1927 when he was twenty-three years old and was brought to Ellis Island to meet the man who was to pick him up when he got to America. Mr. Flubacher can we begin by you giving me your birth date please?

FLUBACHER: October 12th… twelfth of October 04.

SEAGRESS: That’s October 12th 1904, and where in Germany were you born?

FLUBACHER: Ihrengen.

SEAGRESS: Can you spell that please?

FLUBACHER: I-H-R-E-N-G-E-N.

SEAGRESS: Thank you. Where in the country is that?

FLUBACHER: That’s in the south. There’s about eighty miles from the border of Switzerland.

SEAGRESS: Oh I see. Can you describe for me what the town looked like a little bit?

FLUBACHER: And the town lies on a mountain—the mountainous fork in the middle and square for up and four horse where…[Unintelligible: 0:01:22] and the name Kaiser [Unintelligible: 0:01:27] and before you know in the olden times with the Kaiser, when Kaiser was well…killed.

SEAGRESS: When he was killed…

FLUBACHER: …and up there and it shows the stone up there. 

SEAGRESS: You mean like he was beheaded?

FLUBACHER: Yeah.

SEAGRESS: Huh. Can you describe for me what the town looked like when you were a kid?

FLUBACHER: Oh nice. Oh so it was clean. 

SEAGRESS: What kind of buildings did it have?

FLUBACHER: Well they’re all close together—they all the buildings and before—a thousand years ago there was a wall around it. 

SEAGRESS: So it’s an old town?

FLUBACHER: Oh yes and I think in ’27 was thousandth year.

SEAGRESS: Wow. Can you describe for me the house that you lived in when you were a child?

FLUBACHER: Well it the front was there a parlor—a parlor and dining room, and kitchen that we had.

MRS. FLUBACHER: [A woman interrupts incoherently in background]. 

FLUBACHER: Two bedrooms. You would sleep in one and one bedroom upstairs—underneath the roof. You know the roof got [shaver] roofs.

SEAGRESS: Shingle?

FLUBACHER: [Shing]…yeah, no I meant other...the brick stuff

SEAGRESS: Oh like a tile?

FLUBACHER: Tile uh-huh. So and then she had the barn and when we were living for on the grapes. See we make wine and in the fall we sell it to the restaurant…the restaurant and they use it. 

SEAGRESS: How did you heat your house?

FLUBACHER: The heating was with food. There was an open fire and the stove and a big stove warmed—which had three…three feet long and two and a half feet wide. And it went back even in the bread—our own bread. They came once a week to pick the other…them up the bread.

SEAGRESS: Excuse me we’re going to pause just for …okay we’re going to resume now. You were talking about the bread that you baked it in the oven. Who made the bread in your family?

FLUBACHER: The mother. 

SEAGRESS: Your mother made the bread. 

FLUBACHER: To start and the evening before…to put the …in the flour and base it with the yeast on the small…for um right in the for… um…for there’s a big throw over where she worked on it. 

SEAGRESS: And then what would she do with the dough?

FLUBACHER: She’d have another, and then she’d base it once, and come up in the whole body. Then she’d break it apart to make it about three pounds. Well it used to be generally twelve loaves. She had six…six or it would topple …topple over, you know. You could put the [shakes] on top and shakes on the bottom but it had to be all cleaned out—the boot and the ashes—everything had to be cleaned out, and the oven was hot enough it had been in the shade about two, three hours in it. 

SEAGRESS: And what kind of bread was this?

FLUBACHER: It was made from wheat—bread. Wheat. It was white bread but the building was eighty… yeah I think eighty percent eighty or ninety percent—they used only ten percent is waste but they call under the [shell] you know on the wheat. 

SEAGRESS: On the wheat?

FLUBACHER: The wheat. 

SEAGRESS: What other chores did your mother do around the house when you were a child?

FLUBACHER: Oh she had to go out in the field and make that with us. 

SEAGRESS: What…what…what was growing in the field?

FLUBACHER: The grapes! 

SEAGRESS: Oh the grapes oh I see, and so the…

FLUBACHER: The water and the grapes, yeah.

SEAGRESS: They were your family’s grapes. 

FLUBACHER: Yeah, yeah. 

SEAGRESS: Oh what kind of work did you have to do?

FLUBACHER: The grapes were on the mountain. You couldn’t plant anything else. 

SEAGRESS: Do you remember what kind of grapes they were?

FLUBACHER: Well Riesling and Alban…Alban…[Albany], [Muscadine] and some raisins like they use here too. That’s uh what do you call them here uh…

MRS. FLUBACHER: Well can I help you?

FLUBACHER: No. Red grapes

SEAGRESS: And what time of the year did you pick the grapes?

FLUBACHER: October.

SEAGRESS: And then what would you do with them after you picked them?

FLUBACHER: They are going to be squeezed out. Gosh out to a mill and to a mill and just squashed and they stand two or three days [Unintelligible: 0:07:38] to ferment. They’ve got to ferment a little bit and then we press them out and put them in a big bowl. A bowl of [iodine] when we had to clean it you had to rinse out the inside with a big brush with a big hand and we had to brush it …that was a job [laughs]!

SEAGRESS: And how long did they stay in the big vats?

FLUBACHER: Till about January, December or sometime to come out ready. By that time its …and you know its settled you know. The [Unintelligible: 0:08:26] settles on the bottom and the [bell] and we throw it over. The [Unintelligible: 0:08:33] and then they put a little bit more about and have the horses on it—some of ’em have four horses on it. [Strong and somewhat undetectable accent from 0:08:33-45].

SEAGRESS: And do these pails have tops on them—that you transported the wine in?

FLUBACHER: No. But the big pails like a fifty-five gallon pail. 

SEAGRESS: Oh big. Big. Uh huh. 

FLUBACHER: Big. 

SEAGRESS: Did your family keep any of the wine?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah sure we living on it. We drank nine o’clock in the morning we drink a glass of wine; at twelve o’clock we drink another glass of wine. We take the wine with us in the field.

SEAGRESS: And um how much of the wine did your family sell?

FLUBACHER: Well we sell an [omen]; an omen is a hundred fifty German liter. So that omen was one day got twenty-five omen, the other one has thirty-six omen and the other one is an omen so six…six omen. That’s two, four, six, six, six well in the cellar. 

SEAGRESS: So you sold a lot?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah we lived…that’s how our living.

SEAGRESS: What other kinds of food did you eat when you were growing up in Germany?

FLUBACHER: Well the living yes we kill—we raised two to four pigs. Two we kill and two we sell. 

SEAGRESS: [Interrupts] Did you kill the pig? Did you kill the pig? How do you kill a pig?

FLUBACHER: You hit it on the head. First you bring him out of the [Unintelligible: 0:10:34] and hold him on the leg, and then you hit him on the head, and then you hit the head, cut the throat and save their blood—the blood and you make bologna, and a special man works in the town. I had my oldest brother—he was one of them—he makes bologna all kinds of bologna. Brown borscht. Black borscht. Blue borscht. 

SEAGRESS: How is that made from the blood? What do they do to make the bologna?

FLUBACHER: The fat from under the [Unintelligible: 0:11:18] here. We cut that up in small pieces like that and mix it up with the blood, and then we cook it, that’s it and just inside the ligament gets solid and you can hold them for six-eight months. They’re all good. 

SEAGRESS: After the pig—after you had sliced its throat—then what did you do with it?

FLUBACHER: Well then you cut it in pieces—all small pieces, the leg, all four legs, the sides, the ribs, and in a container, a wooden container with a salt brine and I don’t know what the word is for the other stuff. You know the—its got to be brined, and then it lays two weeks in the brine, and then it was four weeks in the chimney with the smokers too to get smoked, and then skewered and those don’t go bad.

SEAGRESS: And so your family would kill two of the pigs? 

FLUBACHER: Two yeah.

SEAGRESS: And how long would the meat last for the two?

FLUBACHER: Well that’s my… I have to let the whole year. 

SEAGRESS: The whole year so.

FLUBACHER: Yeah.

SEAGRESS: I see.

FLUBACHER: One pig in the fall and one in the spring can you let it separate. And then when we got no more uh…not much more meat…on a Sunday you get that beef and my mother went to the butcher to get beef.

SEAGRESS: Only on Sunday?

FLUBACHER: Yes.

SEAGRESS: And how would she prepare it?

FLUBACHER: She’d make the soup…soup out of it. She’d buy it and make her own noodles. Shed cut it up very small, very small noodles. 

SEAGRESS: And that would feed the whole family for Sunday?

FLUBACHER: For Sunday, yeah, while you get the vegetables. The vegetables we got the [Unintelligible 0:13:36] to our self too.

MRS. FLUBACHER: [Speaking in background; difficult to understand].

SEAGRESS: Tell me about school. What was…where did you go to school?

FLUBACHER: Oh we got…we had two schools: one in the north in the town and one in the south. The south…the one in the south was just built in 1911 and we were a hundred and twenty-one in my class in the short, in the first class…was two classes …and the others they had the next year they had more yet and they had to make three classes. 

SEAGRESS: And what kinds of subjects did you learn in school?

FLUBACHER: Well mostly the reading, or anything [speaks German 0:26:44] exactly the forum and different modes that you had to stand between the lines, and they were strict on that. 

SEAGRESS: Is there a teacher that sticks out in your mind from back then? Do you remember any of your teachers?

FLUBACHER: Well you only get one or two years, and then you get always another teacher. Oh one of them we had I remember that he was a Jewish religion and he was teaching Geography you know. The map from Germany and we had to go on the wall and he pointed –he said …and we had to point out where it is, and we didn’t get it but the boys they hit it on the legs, and the girls he points behind [laughs]. That’s that for one teacher. 

SEAGRESS: Could your parents read and write?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. 

SEAGRESS: And what languages could they speak?

FLUBACHER: German. 

SEAGRESS: Did they speak any other languages?

FLUBACHER: In school you have to learn German, and in your home you got to slang that stays thousands of years like …

SEAGRESS: So there are two different kinds. I mean there’s the German that you speak and the German that you learn how to write and how to speak properly—formerly. 

FLUBACHER: Yeah. The school was set up in 1911 to learn everybody the same …the same sound. 

SEAGRESS: So there wouldn’t be these differences? 

FLUBACHER: It wouldn’t be any more. 

SEAGRESS: Oh I see. 

FLUBACHER: Not since 1911 there sure.

SEAGRESS: Well lets talk a little bit about what you knew about America circa when you were a kid…perceive America when you were a kid. 

FLUBACHER: Well we were talking about my uncle, yeah?

SEAGRESS: Right. 

FLUBACHER: Yeah and well my brother he was working on a [one-way train] in a butcher shop, in [Unintelligible: 0:29:32] a city and so he got a little bit a city …city talk you know the high-tone talk. So he heard that and he and my uncle…he said he’s in America and he make good—yeah the bake shop. Well he learned the bake shop over in Germany when he came over here in 1976 or 1876.

SEAGRESS: 1876. So he’d been here a long time then?

FLUBACHER: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: Yeah. Why did you want to go to America?

FLUBACHER: Well we had bad years. Three…four…nineteen…ten…eleven…fourteen then the war started it was bad years—we didn’t get nothing and then one year 1915 …1915 we had bad weather, hail, and they cut all the leaves off from the grapes and they were… they couldn’t grow anymore you know, the grape. The grape…the leaves left alone from the end like an animal like the animals left alone and if they hadn’t gotten the leaves, they couldn’t live anymore, and then the whole thing the whole year we didn’t get grapes. That was bad, that’s why my brother go then he worked very good. He worked right away in a bakeshop; he liked it. 

SEAGRESS: What year did your brother come?

FLUBACHER: ’24. 

SEAGRESS: He came in 24. And did he come here to Troy?

FLUBACHER: Yeah that’s where my uncle and my aunt lived. They live here, their sister…the sister from my uncle lived in Troy too. 

SEAGRESS: I see. 

FLUBACHER: That had come over in 1907.  She was a well…too many people in the house. You only get so many you can feed. That’s hard. 

SEAGRESS: When your brother came in 1924, what kinds of things was he writing back and telling you about? 

FLUBACHER: What? He met that was good. He made by the way a lot of money. I heard one time he wrote that he had fifty-four dollars a week. That was a lot of money. 

SEAGRESS: Can you talk about…

FLUBACHER: [Interrupts] When I come over you get you only get ten dollars and part of that a week as a beggar. 

SEAGRESS: Can you talk a little bit about the inflation that hit Germany just after World War I? 

FLUBACHER: Though that was a bad thing too. The …every…everyday the market ran down and the throw starts with a [holiday]…the working people against the middle people. It’s a revol…it was a revolution. 

SEAGRESS: And how much would things cost then? I mean how did that change?

FLUBACHER: Within…within two years its from which a loaf of bread… a loaf of bread was maybe twenty cents and when they ended it, it was over a million dollars…no million more.

SEAGRESS: How did you…did you have to carry all…

FLUBACHER: [Interrupts] of the money?

SEAGRESS: Yeah. How did you?

FLUBACHER: Pay for it [laughs]. But we didn’t get any. I don’t… I didn’t have any on me. 

SEAGRESS: Well tell me a little bit about your decision to come to America and what it was like to get ready to go?

FLUBACHER: Well only time my brother rode [Unintelligible: 0:34:10] and I went. 

SEAGRESS: But what did you have to do to get ready to leave? How did you get your papers?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah you had to go to the [German word at 0:34:23] to the mail of the town to get the papers—forms—for a farmer and then I had to go to [German word at 0:34:35] to get examined and all of the questions there, and anybody what do you want know, if I’m sick or anything like that, and then I could go. 

SEAGRESS: Did you have to have a physical examination from a doctor before you left?

FLUBACHER: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: That was a [sturcart].

FLUBACHER: That’s a sturcart, an American doctor. 

SEAGRESS: I see. How did your parents feel about you leaving? 

FLUBACHER: Well then they was glad to go and I don’t if … had another brother and sister.

SEAGRESS: Oh did your sister come over too?

FLUBACHER: No, no. 

SEAGRESS: So they …

FLUBACHER: They took over the land you know…

SEAGRESS: Your brother and your sister took over the farmlands, I see. What did you pack to take with you to bring to America?

FLUBACHER: You know the shoes I wore them about ten years [laughs]. My aunt says did you buy any shoes here, and I said no. Then I went and bought a pair of shoes…was size was seven, and she says that’s too tight! That’s too tight! and I said its all right, its all right, well I like them tight and from home—that’s all I had clothes, a suit of clothes for Sunday. That’s what you get home together for Sunday a suit, when you are soon as you get there and come out of the school and wait fourteen years, and then the working set.

SEAGRESS: Was there an object that you brought with you—a thing –something to remember Germany by?

FLUBACHER: No, no.

FLUBACHER: No, no, no. It wasn’t bad—the rocking wasn’t bad—but it hit the rocks, and the lift the propeller in the back, that come out over the weather. 

SEAGRESS: Oh because the boat was lifted right out? Uh huh. Did they have a safety drill?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah, yeah.

SEAGRESS: In case there was an emergency?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah in case, yeah, yeah. They got the safety boat hanging on the side. 

SEAGRESS: Do you remember how many smoke stacks the Stuttgart had? That’s a tough question I know [laughs]. 

FLUBACHER: I know it was two. 

SEAGRESS: Two?

FLUBACHER: Yeah that’s about all I think. 

SEAGRESS: Well now you said you arrived in New York in the very early morning… 

FLUBACHER: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS…and explain to us on tape what happened, why you ended up at Ellis Island? 

FLUBACHER: I don’t know why but they brought us to it—to that landing spot. 

SEAGRESS: And what happened when you got there?

FLUBACHER: They called me by name… that man who had the orders from the company to bring us over to New York City to the railroad station. What do you call it? Well you went to the train stop….no…

SEAGRESS: The depot. 

FLUBACHER: The depot. 

SEAGRESS: So…so they brought you out there and then this man came to meet you?

FLUBACHER: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: And was it just you alone or were there other people?

FLUBACHER: No another fellow from Syracuse. When he had a job before he brought some before on a trolley car? What do you call it? Yeah trolley car … he had arrangements made but all the…you know you had…you only could talk German—you had to talk to somebody.

SEAGRESS: Four o’clock you said. Did you have your luggage with you? 

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah. 

SEAGRESS: Did anything else happen there that you can remember? Were you examined or asked questions, anything like that?

FLUBACHER: The thing was we had a pear… a pear tree in our garden, and my mother gave me what…ten pears. So on the boat I ate two or three, I don’t know. Anyhow they found the pears in the examination, and they threw all of the pears out [laughs]. That’s the only thing I remember. 

SEAGRESS: Can you describe for me what the man looked like that you met who was going to take you to Troy?

FLUBACHER: Oh he was [Unintelligible: 0:44:36] …a little about a foot taller than me. Well I’m not…anyhow but he could talk German…he could talk German and English. I think that was the thing that transport the…in the four hundred dollar

SEAGRESS: [Interrupts] It was the whole party?

FLUBACHER: all together…when I can’t buy…the brother… he couldn’t take [Burakov] so he threw it here…as a beggar he don’t know when the boat came in so he let the control and the [Unintelligible: 0:45:22] man who helped organize which boat to set onto train anyhow. 

SEAGRESS: So you meet the man on Ellis Island and he takes you off the island? 

FLUBACHER: Off the island yeah.

SEAGRESS: And then what happens?

FLUBACHER: Put me on the boat…put me on the train and I think it was late in the afternoon we landed in Albany. My brother was there with his car already a ’24 Ford Touring car. 

SEAGRESS: A 1924 Ford Touring car, uh-huh. 

FLUBACHER: And then we … I was going to ride already. I wanted to turn it around. I did too [laughs].

SEAGRESS: What…when you first got to this country did you see anything that you had never seen before? Anything that was very new? 

FLUBACHER: Oh. Everything was new here, yeah. 

SEAGRESS: But something that sticks out in your mind as being very, very different than what you were used to seeing? 

FLUBACHER: only the dirt laying around I think that was…that was different. The garbage laying around. 

SEAGRESS: You didn’t see that in Europe? 

FLUBACHER: Mm-mm. 

SEAGRESS: Describe for me where your brother took you when he picked you up in the Ford Touring car? Where did he take you?

FLUBACHER: Well he didn’t…he couldn’t take me nowheres else to bring me home, and I was staying there for…

SEAGRESS: Can you describe what his …where he was living for me?

FLUBACHER: Yeah the two-bedroom apartment and he didn’t need a car. He lived on top of the hill in Troy and he worked on King Street with a big [Unintelligible: 0:47:24]. So he didn’t have his car in the garage [Unintelligible: 0:47:32] on a Sunday. 

SEAGRESS: Did your brother learn how to be a baker in Germany?

FLUBACHER: No he was a butcher. 

SEAGRESS: Oh that’s right—this is the brother that made the bologna? 

FLUBACHER: Yeah.

SEAGRESS: Oh I see. 

FLUBACHER: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: Well tell me about the first job you got when you got here. You’re twenty-three years old, right?

FLUBACHER: Right I was supposed to be coming over on a farmer education…to work on a farm so there’s a friend of my brother’s—he had a second hand store on King Street there—and he took me to a farmer in Brunswick. 

SEAGRESS: In Brunswick, uh-huh. 

FLUBACHER:  Yeah and they had fifty cows and I was supposed to milk out the fifty cows and he said he would give me fifty cents a day and you can sleep… board, you know sleep there, and then the man says to him he aint going to work for fifty cents, I gave him a dollar a day. He took me back and I worked with him now maybe two weeks, cleaning furniture, the stoves, cleaning stoves and repairing them, and then watch their place—the bakeshop, with uh…but he died, and they asked me if I would help in the bakeshop, and I was in the bakeshop. 

SEAGRESS: And this is the same bakery that your brother’s working in?

FLUBACHER: No.

SEAGRESS: This is a different one. 

FLUBACHER: This is a different one. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me about how you learned English. 

FLUBACHER: Well I went in school—night school—first…first two years and then she wanted to know arithmetic, she wanted to find out how much…how much we learned over in Germany and I got mad out of it. You don’t have to know that, I didn’t go anymore [laughs].

SEAGRESS: Do you remember what the first English word…

FLUBACHER: [Interrupts] But I worked. I worked all alone in the bakeshop then. See I didn’t have no…no conversation in English. 

SEAGRESS: No one to talk to?

FLUBACHER: So it took me a long time to get to English. 

SEAGRESS: What were you doing in the bakeshop? What were your duties? 

FLUBACHER: Well make all kinds of baked things from pies to cakes, cupcakes, muffins, you eat, and [Unintelligible 0:50:31] that was a big thing.

SEAGRESS: So you said you didn’t have a lot of people to talk with. You know to speak English with…

FLUBACHER: No. 

SEAGRESS: Do you remember your first English word?

FLUBACHER: No that was never. I learned that word home already. My father used to say I…I like…I like…I like you, yeah, that’s it [laughs]. He had that home already from when a friend of his came, and was working here in America and he came out and visited there and they talked to each other, and that’s the word that he used to say many times. 

SEAGRESS: Now did you become a citizen of the United States?

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah. Five years.  

SEAGRESS: Five years. 

FLUBACHER: Yeah you had to wait five years. 

SEAGRESS: Can you describe to me what it felt like to become a citizen?

FLUBACHER: Well I was a little bit confused too. I got my [fellow] fate; he couldn’t go so he says I know a fellow who knows different politics, and I didn’t like it either but he went through it. Yeah he was a democrat and I was supposed to be a republican [laughs]. But I didn’t vote there you know because…[Unintelligible: 0:52:27 ]when you had the… 

SEAGRESS: Did you when…did you miss Germany while you were here?

FLUBACHER: Metzcah. Uh Kiss. This one kiss. Kiss. Just like…

SEAGRESS: K-I-S-S.

FLUBACHER: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: And did you bring her over to the United States? 

FLUBACHER: Yeah. Well she paid for it, or her father paid for it. 

SEAGRESS: Did you meet her when she arrived?

FLUBACHER: No. I sent my aunt down to New York, he had down there, and when you meet her right away they make you get married on the ship before you get on the land. So she liked to go…

SEAGRESS: Did she have any relatives here in America other than…

FLUBACHER: No, nobody. 

SEAGRESS: Nobody. 

FLUBACHER: Still had nobody, and once her brother wanted to come over and he was supposed to go on the farm and they raised chicken, and when it goes through the paper he says your sister worked…was to come over on the farmer visa, and she didn’t go on the farm, you don’t want to farm either; they wouldn’t let them go, so she’s the only one…

SEAGRESS: And you said she didn’t like America when she got here?

FLUBACHER: …Well she went then to work for a family where the wife is … [Speaks German at 0:55:12] from a German family so she could talk a little bit German to her and then tell her what to do, and then got married right away in that home. 

SEAGRESS: Did you have any children?

SEAGRESS: And what are their names?

FLUBACHER: One is John, Fred, and Ronald.

SEAGRESS: Have you ever been back to Germany to visit?

FLUBACHER: Only since well in ’58 the middle one was in the army here when they sent them over to Germany. He was stationed in Germany, so then I went to see him. Then when I retired I went three times. 

SEAGRESS: Did you go back to the town where you had grown up?

FLUBACHER: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: How did it feel to see your town?

FLUBACHER: Oh it’s awful [laughs]. No it was better you know. The streets were better, like blacktops, before was horrible roof. But…

SEAGRESS: Did you have any relatives left over there? 

FLUBACHER: Oh yeah. I still got them I was there but then cousins are living over there—all four of the women—the aunts.
