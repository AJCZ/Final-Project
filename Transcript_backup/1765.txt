Mr. Vetzigian is an Armenian, came from Shabin Karhisar, Turkey in 1920 when he was twenty years old. Why don’t you begin by giving me your full name and date of birth, please. VETZIGIAN: Okay. My name is Gaidzag, George Gaidzag Vetzigian. I was born in 1906, January 28th, in Shabin Karhisar, Turkey. OFLAZIAN: Can you spell me your name, please, and the town you were born in? (there is a pause) Mr. Vetzigian is putting in writing in order to... VETZIGIAN: S-H-A-B-I-N, Shabin. K-A-R-H-I-S-A-R. Shabin Karhisar. OFLAZIAN: How do you spell Gaidzag. VETZIGIAN: G-A-I-D-Z-A-G. OFLAZIAN: And what does it mean in English? VETZIGIAN: That means lightning. Lightning. OFLAZIAN: And why you are called George Gaidzag Vetzigian? VETZIGIAN: Because when I came to America, I went to Public School Eighty-eight in Queens. And because I, I, I knew nothing about the English language, and my, the, the students next to me asked me my name, and they couldn’t pronounce my name. They said we gonna call you George, and my name became George from there on. So I call myself George Vetzigian. OFLAZIAN: Can you describe me your town that you were born in, Shabin Karhisar? VETZIGIAN: Well, Shabin Karhisar is a place in Turkey, in Turkey, Asia Minor, near Sivas and Samsun, in a small town, mostly Armenians, separated from the Turkish section. And, and there were a lot of Greek section, too. And my father was at the stores. They used to travel to the store selling material, things to make costume, suits and dresses and things like that. What else would you like to know about it? OFLAZIAN: What was the major industry of this town? VETZIGIAN: I, I don’t, well, various things. Nothing special. Various things. OFLAZIAN: Like what? VETZIGIAN: I was about eight, nine years old at that time, and really don’t remember, what they produced. But only one thing I know of, there was a big friction between the Armenians and Turks. Because the Armenians were in control of the business over there, and the Turkish didn’t like the idea of the Armenians being so far advanced. And they did like the Armenians, and they always tried to get even with the Armenians, you know what I mean? OFLAZIAN: So, which means there was sort of rejections in the... VETZIGIAN: Rejections because the Armenians were Christian and they were Muslims. And there was the main thing, and they never liked the, they never liked the Christians. And Armenians were devoted Christians, and they had control of the business in there. Most of the Armenians were businessmen, and not so many of the Turk, Turkish people. So they were jealous of the Armenians at that time, and there was a little friction. OFLAZIAN: How many people you were at home? VETZIGIAN: Oh, we were three brothers and two sisters. And my grandmother was with us, and I had many, many relatives on my father’s side and my mother’s side. We’re a very big clan. Armenian clan.

VETZIGIAN: It was, my second brother and my, there were twins. One boy and one girl. Twins. Tzolak and Tzlohi. The boy’s name was Tzolak, and the girl’s name Tzlohi. They were one year old when the massacre came on. OFLAZIAN: Can you spell me, your, their names? VETZIGIAN: Tzolak. T-Z-O-L-A-K. Tzolak. That’s the, that’s the boy. And Tzlohi means T-Z-L-O-H-I, something like that. Tzlohi. OFLAZIAN: And do you do what does it mean in English, Tzlohi? VETZIGIAN: I really don’t, Tzolak. It means, something, something, does it mean lightning, or, no, something in reference to light. Light, yeah, Tzolak means. OFLAZIAN: What was your mother’s name? VETZIGIAN: My name, my mother’s name was Aisalus [PH]. Aisalus. OFLAZIAN: And what does it mean in English? VETZIGIAN: Aisalus means dawn. Dawn. Dawn. OFLAZIAN: Can you spell it?

Sivat. So there were three rooms, and my father was a businessman. He had a store. They used to sell clothes, and they had another store far away. And once in a while he used to go to the other store and come back to Shabin Karhisar to see everything is right. OFLAZIAN: Can you tell me any experience that you experienced with your family. VETZIGIAN: Well, only one thing that I remember. My father bought a sewing machine. At that time there was no sewing machine in, in my town Shabin Karhisar. And it was a, a hand sewing machine.

But I used to eat it. Yeah. OFLAZIAN: You liked that, huh? VETZIGIAN: Oh, yes. It was nice. OFLAZIAN: So, can you tell me how the religious life looked like in those days?

OFLAZIAN: So, can you describe me the Turkish attack, please. VETZIGIAN: Well, my... LEVINE: Take this, because it’s for the microphone. VETZIGIAN: I’m sorry. I remember that my grandfather was working for the Turkish government. He was a notary public, and he was a lawyer. He was working for the Turkish government. And one day the gendarmes came and told my grandfather that, that the, the governor of Sivas wants to see my grandfather with couple of other Armenians, you know? And... OFLAZIAN: What was your grandfather’s name? VETZIGIAN: Neshan. Neshan. Neshan Serjenian. OFLAZIAN: Can you spell his name? VETZIGIAN: N-E-S-H-A-N. Neshan. And, these gendarmes came and told my grandfather that he has to go to Sivas to see the governor. So my grandfather thought that he’s going to be promoted. There’s going to be a promotion for him when he goes to see the governor. And they went with couple of Armenians, and those were elderly people. And next day one of our neighbors came. He says, ‘You know,’ he says, ‘We saw, we saw Neshan Effendi [PH].’ My grandfather and the others were killed. OFLAZIAN: What, what is the word Effendi means? VETZIGIAN: Effendi is a Turkish word means, (he pauses) Effendi, it’s means Mister. Not Mister, but it’s, it’s respectable name. It’s a respectable name. Effendi. It’s, it’s a Turkish word. It means Mister, or, or grownup, they call their grownup people Effendi. So, then we knew that they killed my grandfather and few others. And Shabin Karhisar is between two mountains. And... OFLAZIAN: And what, what, which mountains are these? VETZIGIAN: I don’t know the names of it. I don’t know the names of it. But (he pauses), so Turkish, Turkish gendarmes used to come to our house. Now, my father was a young man. You see what I mean? He was supposed to the army at that time. There was the war on. And in order for him not to go because he got a family, he’s got children, he used to pay beddel [PH]. Bed, beddel means that instead, instead of going to, to army, you pay money to the government. And he paid money to the government. And every, every once in a while they used to come and ask for more money. More money. More money. And, and the gendarmes, gendarmes came and they want to see where my father’s inside of the house. They want to take him, put him in the army. And my father said, ‘Don’t take me. I paid many, many beddels.’ You know what I mean. ‘I’m covered up.’ Understand? So they used to come and start bothering the female. The gendarmes, you know? So this went on, and, and the army, people didn’t like the idea of the Turkish gendarmes come to our house. So we went to the mountains. And we fought against the Turks for twenty-nine days. My country and the Shabin Karhisar did that. You understand? We fought them for twenty-nine days, and we carried everything up to the mountain. It was a ford. It was a mountain and a ford on top of it. After we fought about twenty-nine days and there was no, nothing to eat, nothing to fight with. Ammunition was depleted. So the Turks came and they took us, they killed all the men. All the men. Since I was nine years old, they put us around, made a circle of all those boys, not the girls, not the girls. Girls were able to go. They’re free. But not the boys. And they were throwing carcass into burners. And there was a Turkish religious man. He says, ‘You can’t kill these boys.’ He says, ‘God told me that you cannot kill them.’ So that’s how I became survived. Otherwise at my age, being a nine years old, eight, nine years old, they, they, Turks killed it. Now they, nobody came alive from my father’s side. I had cousins that all was killed. OFLAZIAN: So, what happened to your brothers and other sisters, mother... VETZIGIAN: Well, they were banished. They were, they were banished. I don’t know what happened to them. I found them about two years later. I, they put me in a, in a Turkish orphanage. They made a Turk out of me. You understand what I mean? And about two, three years later my mother came and found me. They found me. And, and one night she came, and she looked for me and she found me, and... OFLAZIAN: Where was your mother that time? VETZIGIAN: I don’t know where she was. She was, she was banished to other places. Understand what I mean? So, my, my, my, my, my brother, my two br, my two my brother died from the starvation. OFLAZIAN: How old was he that time? VETZIGIAN: He was about seven years old. Seven, seven years old my brother was. And my sister died from the, from typhoid, typhoid. Typhoid sickness. And I had another twins. One girl, one boy, they were about one year old at that time. And one of them, one of them, fell down from my, my mother’s, was holding two of them, you know what I mean? One of them fell down and died, and the other one died from starvation. OFLAZIAN: Where was your father? VETZIGIAN: My father was killed in front of my eyes. The, when the Turks came, when the Turks came, you see, I’m not saying this in rotation. That’s why it’s all, it’s all, they killed my father. My father came to tell us that the Turkish soldiers are coming. This is up in the mountains. The Turkish soldiers are coming. And at that time the, the Turkish soldiers shot my father. And my father fell down, and my mother ran to lift him up. They wouldn’t let her do it. Understand what I mean? All the men was killed. None of the men from my town came out alive. They were killed. The only one that was saved was women and the girls and the boys that were about a little less that nine years old. OFLAZIAN: Do you have any idea where they went, these womans and childrens? VETZIGIAN: When the Turk came to the mountains they took all of us, all the Armenians. They put them down in the church courtyard. And in the church, church courtyard, most of the women taking poisons, because they didn’t want to be, Turks to get control of them, and they do a lot of things to the females, and so forth. So they were taking poisons. But my mother didn’t take poison. So they, they, aksor [PH]. You know what aksor means? What was the Turkish (unintelligible). OFLAZIAN: Did they take her to their zone? VETZIGIAN: No. No. OFLAZIAN: Aksor? VETZIGIAN: Aksor. Aksor means... OFLAZIAN: Like in, in prison, prisonment. Isolation? VETZIGIAN: Isolation. They isolate, they send you to different places. I, I, my mother, my mother came and found me in a Turkish orphanage. They, they took me because I was a little boy at that time. They figure out that they can put me in a Turkish orphanage and they, they made read the Koran. I knew the Koran Turkish Bible from beginning to end. I was very good at it. OFLAZIAN: How did you learn that? VETZIGIAN: They teach you over there. That, the, so my... OFLAZIAN: And you knew how to say in Turkish way? VETZIGIAN: I was excellent in, in, in, in, in Turkish. I was able to write... OFLAZIAN: And where was... VETZIGIAN: ...able to write, and able to read anything that you want to, I used to write letters in Turkish. But when I came to America I didn’t use it and now I forgot. I don’t know one word of the Turkish word. Yeah. Yeah. OFLAZIAN: So, where was located that orphanage? VETZIGIAN: Orphanage was in Sivas. It’s one of the, one of the villages of the Turkey. Sivas is a big town, big place. OFLAZIAN: So in the orphanage how they treated you, these Turkish people? VETZIGIAN: They were very strict. You gotta learn the Bible, Turkish Bible. You know what I mean? And I was very good at it. I knew it from the beginning to the end. And, in fact, I knew Turkish very, very well. I used to write letters to the people who want to, Armenians. Armenian woman who lost a, a daugh, lost their husbands and children. And they used to come to me, and write a letter to the insurance company saying that my, my husband was insured, my, my, my husband was insured, to collect the insurance. OFLAZIAN: Did you wrote these, did you write these letters in Armenian alphabet? VETZIGIAN: No, no, no. Turkish. OFLAZIAN: Turkish. VETZIGIAN: The old Turkish. Not the new Turkish. OFLAZIAN: What kind of alphabet is that? Turkish alphabet? VETZIGIAN: Turkish, Turkish, Turkish, now they, they, they use the regular, regular lettering and that, you know. But at that time it was a Muslim, Turkish lettering. OFLAZIAN: Like an Arabic, Arabic... VETZIGIAN: Arabic. Arabic. Right, right. That’s it. Arabic, yeah. OFLAZIAN: Okay. After you went through all this horrible... VETZIGIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: ...you know, difficult times in your life, have you ever wondered what your future will be? VETZIGIAN: Well, did I wonder? I didn’t know, I didn’t know what was going to be my, if I stayed, if I stayed in, in Turkey, naturally it would have been bad. But my mother found me and couple of years later she brought me to Constantinople, you know. And from Constantinople my, my aunts adopted me, and brought me to America in 1920. OFLAZIAN: Was that relate to, to your father’s side, or to your mother’s side? VETZIGIAN: My mother’s side? OFLAZIAN: And what was her name? VETZIGIAN: Hagoohi, Hagoohi. Hagoohi Isengenian [PH]. OFLAZIAN: Can you spell me Hagoohi? VETZIGIAN: (he laughs) (he pauses) Hagoohi. H-A-G-O-O-H-I. Hagoohi. Was first name, yeah. OFLAZIAN: Now we are going to pause for a few minutes while Mr. Kevin, the recording engineer, flips the tape. VETZIGIAN: Uh-huh. All right.
