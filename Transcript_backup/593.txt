DALLETT: My name is Nancy Dallett, and I'm speaking with Herman Gold on Thursday, October 24, 1985. We are beginning this interview at 3:20 PM and we're going to hear the story of Dr. Gold's immigration from Argentina in 1924. Let's start back at the beginning, and could you tell me where and when you were born? GOLD: I was born on February 25, 1908 in the town of, in a small town of Podolia Gubernia [ph] in the Ukraine. My parents lived in a small village, what in Jewish life was known as a schtetl. And my parents, my parents left Russia in 1920. Following the Russian-Japanese War and the subsequent rebellion, there was a tremendous increase in anti-Semitism and as a result a great many Jewish people emigrated from Russia. One large wave came to the United States. And a second wave went to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Although my mother's family were in the United States, my father decided to go to Argentina. And to me it's fascinating that here they were, early middle life, with two children, my oldest sister and myself. Father had been thoroughly educated in religious matters. He was a great student of Hebrew and the Torah but had had no secular education whatsoever, and had been engaged in small business as a middle man. And regardless of that lack of what I would think necessary preparation, took his young wife and two children, travelled from communist, from Podolia Gubernia [ph], Kamanetz Podolsk [ph] is the small town that I was born in. Kamanetz Podolsk [ph]. Went through Poland, Germany, to Hamburg, where was the point of departure. got on a boat and went to Argentina. His only knowledge was Hebrew, Jewish and, I presume, some Russian. And we settled in Buenos Aires. I was about, I was born in 1908, arrived in Buenos Aires in 1910, so I was just about two years old. And I have absolutely no recollection whatsoever of life in Russia. But was raised, together with my sister in Argentina. There was a large Jewish community considering the small size of the Argentine population. At that time the total population of Argentina was about six million people, two million of whom was settled in the capital city of Buenos Aires. The original thought behind the Jewish migration to Argentina was that they would settle in the, in the country. And they would become farmers. But together with the Italian immigrants and the Spanish immigrants, which were the large two immigrant sub-sections of the Argentina population, practically all of the Jews settled in Buenos Aires. And the usual occupation when you arrived in Buenos Aires was to become a peddlar. You became a small middle man, loaded up a huge bulk of merchandise on your back. They were the days before horse and wagon and automobiles. And went to the outskirts of Buenos Aires and even outside of the capital city itself and peddled, sold, you established a clientele and sold mostly on the installment business, some of it for cash. And that way you got started in business. And that's what my father, as many other thousands of Jews did in Buenos Aires. We, my sister and I, were raised as young kids, as all other Argentinean kids, we went to public school. My sister did a very unusual thing. Unusual because Argentina is a Catholic country. By which I mean that actual, it's a subsidized religious, the Catholic church is officially subsidized by the government. Although the public education is secular, non-religious. And my sister, but with that kind of Catholic background and Spanish background, you would be surprised to learn that she attended, there was only in the whole city of Buenos Aires one, one high school for women. And out of the whole city of two million, one high school, there were, I would say there were probably ten for young boys and she went through the high school. Graduated from high school, and then upon graduation from high school in 1920, decided to go to the faculty of medicine because in Argentina, as in the European countries, public education consists of five years of high school. The lyceum type of education, which is almost the equivalent of a junior college in the United States. And upon graduation then you entered the University in which ever faculty you wanted to and you spent seven years in medicine or you went into the PhD or the humanities or the law school. And she chose medicine for her career. And I presume that she was one of the very few women in the medical school in those days and particularly very exceptionally, one Jewish young woman, because in those days in Buenos Aires women were not supposed to go beyond public school and certainly very few of them dreamed of becoming a professional person. But my parents, particularly my mother, was set on seeing that her children got an education and my sister set the pace for the rest of us. And I followed and went through high school and at the end of the first, my father over the period of years between 1910 and 1924 never bothered to acquire an Argentine citizenship. Perhaps because military service was compulsory in Argentina. I'm surmising that was the reason, that he didn't want, want his three boys, we were, two of us were born in Russia, my sister and I, and two boys were born in Argentina. He did not want to see his three boys become members of the Argentine army. Be it as it may, he, we went through public school, we got a formal Jewish education. It was a very strong Jewish community in Israel [sic] there were a number of synagogues and Talmud Torahs throughout the city. My father was active in, although he was interested from an intellectual point of view, as he grew and became older in Argentina his religiosity was confined to the Holy Holidays. And then at that time I can still remember seeing, hearing him, he was so well versed that everybody else by comparison appeared to be an ignoramus. And consequently he just went for those three days. But we, we got our secular education, our Jewish education, my mother maintained a Jewish home, and got along fine. Argentina was a quite open city as far as the Jewish community. We weren't aware of anti-Semitism as such except once a year. And that was at the time of Easter. Characteristic of the Spanish tradition that you became very conscious, the public, of the death of Christ. And at that time, which was a whole week where no movies showed the usual fare of Hollywood pictures of Tom Mix and Pearl White that was our daily fare, or weekly fare. That week was devoted all to religious pictures. Officially connected with the religious theme. And then we would see inscribed, we'd get up for just the first day of that particular Easter holiday and we'd see inscriptions, graffiti on the walls, "Judeos, Jews, Christ killers." And that was actually the official extent, although on every other block there was a church, a Catholic Church in Buenos Aires, and people, particularly the Italian and Hispanic population, were very religious minded. Well, to make a long story short, my father did fare quite well financially. Went into, from peddling into a small store, then opened up a haberdashery, at times he went to the wholesale business and had some reverses and went back into the retail business. And my mother assisted in the store and as I grew up I became quite conscious of the need to help him in the store. I managed to graduate from high school by taking, skipping two years over a period of several summers, by taking the so-called "free standing" examinations. As long as you felt prepared you were entitled to ask for an examination and if you passed it, written and oral, you could skip the whole year. DALLETT: What were your languages at this point? GOLD: The language in Argentina was Spanish. That's the official language. At home we spoke with our parents in Jewish. So I learned as a youth to speak Spanish very fluently because it was my everyday language at school and at play. And at home my parents insisted that we use Jewish. My father's Spanish was an acquired, not an educated Spanish, and his was a mixture of Jewish and Russian and a little Italian and a little Spanish that he had learned. My mother could speak Spanish but, as I said, the home language was Jewish. My sister got into, all this time my mother, throughout the World War, World War One, lost complete contact of her family in the United States. And her sister, who had been with us in Argentina, had migrated almost at the same time with her husband and family, had returned to Russia prior to World War One. So that we were isolated except for one uncle, my father's brother, who had settled in Buenos Aires. So that as a result of World War One we had no contact with either, any of the relatives still living in Russia, and all of those, my mother's practically entire family, had migrated to the United States. Then, to sort of hurry things along, my sister became very ill at the end of her first year of medical school, she was operated on. They thought that she had an abscess of the kidney. Was treated royally by her teachers at the University Hospital, but then subsequently and belatedly they discovered that there was an abscess of the kidney, but the background was tuberculosis of the spine. So-called Pott's disease. P-O-T-T-S. Which is tuberculosis of the spine in an abscess called abscess at a point behind the kidney. And that abscess became secondarily infected and she suffered for about eighteen months and then died. In those days we had no, no anti-tuberculosis treatment except heliotherapy. Go to the mountains and get rest and sun. When she died I had just finished high school, graduated from high school. My mother was very, very despondent over her only daughter's death and became depressed and was going to visit doctors for medical care. And one day my father, we had a store, a haberdashery store, and a customer stopped in after looking at the window. And then asked for, for some merchandise, I don't know whether it was a shirt or a tie. And in the process said to my mother, who was waiting on him, "I am a sailor and I've come from America. I have a message for you." What had happened was that this American sailor had been in Chester, Pennsylvania. And had, his boat was for repairs at the Sun Shipyard. And one day he went down Market Street in Chester and shopped. My uncle had a prominent, very prominent haberdashery store, and in the course of shopping talked to my uncle, who said, inquired about his occupation and told him he was a seaman and he was ready, waiting for the boat to leave, so he would go to Buenos Aires. So my uncle said to him, "I have a sister in Buenos Aires from whom I haven't heard in years. Could you, when you arrive to Buenos Aires, locate her?" And I presume, I don't know whether it was my uncle or whether this seaman did it on his own, went to, upon arrival to Buenos Aires, went into the central office of the Israeli, Argentine-Israeli community society and obviously had no trouble locating Goldensveig. Because my father had been prominent in the community and in religious affairs. And this is how he came. And when he said, he said, "I have greetings and I have, here's their address." And I remember reading it. When I came home my mother told me the story and it was "Chester, Pa." Because PA in Spanish is pa. I had no idea that PA stood for Pennsylvania. In high school, naturally the official language is Spanish. But we had three, three additional languages. Compulsory. We had to take French three years, Italian two years, and French three years. The English that I got, naturally, was the classical English, the equivalent of the Spanish that you get in the United States. We had an English, a lovely lady, who came from London, England, and spoke to us, naturally in English English. And I thought that I, when I got on, when my parents decided to come to Argentina I thought I knew English. And when I got on the boat the first thing I asked was, "Where's the water closet?" And the sailors looked at me like I was the man from Mars. And all equivalent, very, very soon I realized that I knew very little English, or no English at all on the boat. When we arrived and we got this, my mother corresponded and in a very short period of time my uncles, who were well off. There were five of them, all living in Chester Pa. They wrote to her asking to come to the United States and she was all by herself. She had lost her daughter. Had no one else except just an uncle, my father's, a brother-in-law on my father's side. And my parents decided, they were already in their mid-forties, to pack up and go on. So now we, my uncles did all the work as far as admission to the quota system, on the Russian, as immigrants from Argentina on the Russian quota. That was in 1924. How they did it I can't tell you except that I will give you a bit of background of who they were. We were in Buenos Aires, we needed to have, naturally, Russian passports because we're Russian, considered Russian citizens. Now this is 1924 and if you know your history, there had been a Revolution in Russia and the communist government of Russia was not recognized. Neither by the United States nor by all of the South American countries. And therefore the Argentine government, needing somebody to represent the Russians living in Argentina, asked the consul that had been living in Buenos Aires, representing the czar's government, to continue in his functions as representing the Russian state in Argentina. So it was very simple to get a Russian passport because he was making his living by selling passports. So when we went up for the passport he looked at me and said, "You're sixteen. You're older now, you should have your own passport." And I got my passport and the rest of the family went, because my two brothers were much younger, went with the family passport. In the name of, my name in Argentina was Juan Goldensveig. My father was Adolfo, or Abraham Goldensveig. And my uncles actually assisted in getting the transportation for the whole family. And my father very quickly liquidated all his business and his home furnishings and we left on the American Legion from Buenos Aires to New York in 1924. On the boat I very quickly became very friendly with some of the seamen and I was very, all of sixteen and I had a wonderful time learning the insides of the ship. We went third class. It was comfortable. I have very little recollection of the boat. The only thing that sticks in my mind are two, the two stops. One in Santos, we stopped for the day to load coffee. Because all the coffee was exported via the port of Santos. And I don't ( break in tape ) and I listened to this huge ( discussion about being on or off record ) the boat stopped at Rio De Janeiro and we did visit the city and the port view is magnificent. It's one of the greatest ports in the world. And the view is magnificent. And then we came straight to New York. It took three weeks on the boat from Buenos Aires to New York in those days. And the boat arrived in the day and therefore it was a great hurry to clear all the passengers because we were running into a National holiday which, belatedly I learned it was Memorial Day. And they were very anxious to get through with the customs officials before the holiday. And as we lined up in Ellis Island the whole family as a unit, my parents first, my father and mother, I was next in age, and my two brothers, the public health officer looked at us and examined, and as soon as he saw something on my father, which I had no idea what it was, he asked him to stay aside. And then we went through the examination, which was a very perfunctory examination and we passed. But then came to the official in charge of papers. And since we had a single visa, and since my father had been detained for health reasons, unknown, nature of which were unknown to us, then the whole family had to stay in Ellis Island. DALLETT: You did have a separate passport through, no? GOLD: I had a Russian passport, but the American visa was a family visa. See? So the passport was of no value to me. And then we were not told what was wrong with my father, nor were we told how long we would have to stay and why we had to stay, except they said the whole family has to wait until disposition is made on the status of Adolfo Goldensveig. And naturally . . . DALLETT: Was it a matter of not being able to communicate because of language difficulties? GOLD: No, no, that wasn't, they just didn't tell you what was wrong. They wouldn't. It was none of our business and it would be a decision that they, had to be made. And we immediately were separated. My father went somewhere else in Ellis Island where, later on we found out he was taken to the medical dispensary and kept there. And we were thrown in with the general population. And there was a stable, a stable, I use the word advisedly, very stable immigrant population on Ellis Island that had lived there for weeks, months, and years because they were all undesirables as far as the immigration department was concerned. And they had to be kept on Ellis Island until a country was willing to receive them. And if, either because of political reasons or criminal reasons, they had no departure and acceptance of a new home, they had to stay in Ellis Island. DALLETT: This is the end of side one of interview number 60. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO DALLETT: This is the beginning of side two of interview number 60 with Herman Gold. GOLD: Naturally you, the question that presents itself, what was your reaction in Ellis Island. DALLETT: You got it. GOLD: The reaction was one of tremendous surprise, of tremendous anxiety because, A, we didn't know why we were there, B, we didn't know how long we were going to be there, and particularly we were immediately told on arrival that nobody would be able to see us until after the Memorial holidays because Ellis Island was closed until the day after the weekend holiday. And so that therefore we found ourselves with a motley crew of people, totally unknown, some very ferocious looking, rather hardened, not that they may have not been perfectly peaceful souls, but I'm sure they had spent a great many days living in Ellis Island, actually a jail. Because what you did was, we were given, we got in line, like in the army, for supper. And you were given utensils and served in lines and you sat down and ate it. And then at the end of that you walked and you had an area, a walking area which was closed in with barbed wire, and looking out on the East River. And at a distance you could see the Statue of Liberty. We did see the Statue of Liberty on the way in and we were terribly excited at the idea that we were coming to America. But there was very little excitement. It was a great deal of depression looking at the lady of the Statue of Liberty from behind prison barbed wire. Then came, we went to bed. And it came nighttime, my mother, being naturally a female, had to be separated from her three children. And she was put with the women. And the three boys, and I was the oldest, sixteen and the youngest, Joe, was about twelve. No, maybe less, ten, ten. There was no, we had to stay with the men. And then you, there were, sleeping quarters were just bunks, one on top of each other. And naturally the old residents who knew exactly what they wanted, would always pick the lower berths and you had to climb to the very top and then they offered you two grey army blankets. And it was Memorial Day, early Spring, but we were right on the East River. It got very cold. And then all of a sudden, here we were, three kids, one close to each other, and all of a sudden in the middle of the night feeling a jerk and somebody took off your blankets because whoever was strongest made sure that he was warm at the expense of whoever couldn't protect himself. And then in the morning naturally the only thing we saw, we got together with our mother for breakfast and the only thing we could do, all four of us, was cry. And finally, after two days of the weekend, the holidays, my uncle showed up, who had been waiting to take us to Chester Pa. And my uncle informed us then, because he naturally spoke English very well, there had been some trouble with my father. And what, the trouble was that the public health officer had seen a very grey brown nail that we as kids always had our eye focused on. If your father has a blemish you always, and time and again in Argentina, I asked my father, "What is that, Dad?" And he said, "Oh, it's, I must have bumped it and it got discolored and thickened. It doesn't bother me." He never bothered seeing a doctor or doing anything about it for at least the fourteen years that I had personal consciousness in Argentina. And this office had picked him up because they felt this was a fungus infection of the nail which later on in medical practice I saw hundreds of examples. It causes no disability whatsoever. It's not contagious in the sense of fungus disease of the scalp or fungus disease of, that children get of the skin. But, to his high standards of medical practice, he felt that that would be a danger to have an immigrant with such a nail. Well, there was nothing my uncle could do for us but leave us in Ellis Island and he said he would go back to Chester and see what they could do. And my uncles were quite well-to-do businessmen in Chester Pa. And two of them had served in World War One in the United States Army. And naturally very proud of their legionnaire button. And this, what I'm telling you now is the stuff that I learned later on when my uncle came back to take us out of Ellis Island. They immediately got busy, through the an Legion, and they were, in political powers that be. And my two uncles who were the Legionnaires were directed to see a very important political figure in Pennsylvania, which later on I learned was none other than Congressman Butler. Congressman Butler was the Chairman, I later found out, was the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the House. He lived in Westchester. He was the father of the very later on famous General Smedley Butler, the Marine Commandant who chased the Nicaraguans for many years during the occupation of Nicaragua and later on became Police Commissioner in Philadelphia, and later on after retirement wrote a beautiful book in which he exposes the role of policeman for Wall Street in Central America. Now, his father Butler was a very important Republican who listened to my uncles and promised that he would see what he could do. And it took all of three weeks. And finally Washington authorized the Public Health Service on Ellis Island to go ahead and perform an operation which consisted in the removal of the nail. For which my father, my uncles had to pay expenses of his stay in Ellis Island as well as the medical care, which was, I was told later on by my uncle that it amounted to five hundred dollars. We are speaking now in terms of 1924. All the three weeks we managed to see my father twice at the most, that we were allowed visits to the dispensary where he was completely kept away from the rest of the population of Ellis Island. And those three weeks were just a perennial agony for my mother and for the three children because we felt totally helpless, caught in a, in a totally unnecessary problem which was artificially created, had no medical meaning whatsoever, produced a great deal of emotional agonizing turmoil. After my father was operated, that week my mother developed a severe cold which, as everybody said, was due to exposure to the, to the lack of heating and the cold air. And we notice,d i noticed that she started to cough. And just the day when my father was discharged and my uncle came for the whole family, we decided, my uncle, because she was coughing and looked sick and she was feverish, that we would stay with a step-brother of hers in, in the Bronx. No, on the East Side, East Side. And just that night she had a violent chill, a violent chill, fever, a hundred and three, a hundred and four, and began to spit up blood. So here we were now, stuck, the whole family, in the East Side in a small apartment. Stepbrother had two sons who were in the textile, working in the garment industry. And to this day I remember the scene because I knew that I was going to go for medicine and I had had this year of exposure from my sister in medical school. And I remember the family doctor coming to examine my mother and then my uncle asking for a consultation because he felt she had lobar pneumonia. And lobar pneumonia in those days was, carried a mortality of twenty-five, thirty percent, at least. And I remember to this day, I don't know why, that the name of the consultant stuck to me from 1924, a Dr. Schwartz. And I have a mental picture of this Dr. Schwartz coming in as the professor. Everyone, there was a consultant, you had to be a so-called professor in New York. And he examined my mother and percussing, what I learned later on percussion because I did it myself, chest, and then saying yes, she has pneumonia. And in those days you didn't take x-rays, you didn't do any laboratory study And then gave a serious prognosis that she, he felt she was healthy otherwise and had a good chance, but there was mortality rate of at least one third of the people suddenly dying at the time of crisis. So, by that time, after two, three days, and one of my uncles, one of my cousins who was in the garment industry, and I was dressed in a gaberdine suit with pleated pants, the latest, you know. You have an idea of it, in Argentina, in Buenos Aires, we thought very highly of ourselves. It was a very cosmopolitan city. It was called the Paris of South America. And we thought all of the educational system was geared to France, Germany and England. Nobody in those days were oriented to America as it occurred following World War Two. Our exposure to America was via the movies and the introduction, I remember in 1924, of chewing gum. Chicklets. We had a lot of fun with Chicklets. And I thought that I was coming from a civilized country to this barbarian country of cowboys that I saw in the movies. And therefore I was a little bit put out when my uncles in New York started making fun of my pleated pants, that became thirty years later the rage in America. And they decided I needed a haircut. My hair was a little bit long. And I had my first haircut, bought by, paid by my cousin, on the East Side. And after three days, or four days, when my mother looked like she was holding, my uncle had to come back to Chester because he had left a business going and his own family because he didn't expect to run into pneumonia. Poor soul didn't expect to run into the whole trouble of Ellis Island. Then he had to come to New York and here we finally got out of Ellis Island and he had his sister, his oldest sister, my mother, with lobar pneumonia. And they were scared, they had their pants scared out of them. So he decided that the three boys and he should come back to Chester Pa. And I remember we drove in a beautiful Stuts car. It was a very sporty long car and we drove to Chester and I arrived to my uncle's place on 22nd Street, which in those days in Chester, were all the well-to-do business peoples' homes and so forth, lived. Now that gives you, does that give you some background? Now, what is my next question, is your reaction to Ellis Island? My reaction is one of bitterness, of futility, of totally disregard for human sensitivity and human feeling. That sure we must have control of immigration and population, but that if we are going to do it we must approach it in a humane way. True enough that you've got to put everybody through a standardized method, and Ellis Island was the method. But if there was an inability for any reason, a person couldn't come in, be it health or otherwise, there ought to be good solid reasons and not superficial medical reasons. Besides that, once you detained a person, then legally, although the law is applied coldly and says if you have one family visa everybody is held up. There ought to be a quick way of remedying the situation right there and saying the other three are healthy, they have immigrant status, why should they be held up on Ellis Island just because all four names appear on a piece of paper. There ought to be a magistrate or a judge or an immigration officer that can split up the piece of paper and clear the healthy ones and the other ones. Secondly, if you are going to maintain, even assuming, then there ought to be a humane, a decent way. You don't throw in immigrants that come to America and who are going to offer their very best for the country and for themselves, and make America their home and establish families and make their contribution. Because America is a country of immigrants. You don't throw them in a mixture, a pot, where there are people to be deported because they are criminals, people deported because they are thugs, people who are deported because they are morally undesirable, as well as people who are perfectly decent but may have their so-called "wrong political ideas." There were many people who were being deported because they were Reds and they were thrown into this pot where there was just a jungle where the strongest and the brutest had the upper hand. And that's the most offensive part of all of my Ellis Island experience. As a sequel to it, I went to college. I came to Chester and I had all my papers, high school diplomas, all properly authenticated and, you know, if you've ever been to Latin America there's a great deal of pomp and ceremony. The president always shows up with a big sash and big colors. The army is always, although our generals are doing pretty well now, displaying all the, all the military medals and so forth. My diploma, going year by year, with all the sash of the Republic, Argentine Republic, and the official stamps on every place, it was a very impressive document. And I then decided I would go to university. My mother insisted that we were immigrants and we were very poor and we were hitting now, it was very difficult to make a living in those days, that I should go to college b otherwise she wouldn't have come to the United States. And I applied to the University of Pennsylvania and they gave me full credit for my high school degree and admitted me as a freshman. And then, naturally, I was seriously handicapped because I didn't know any English. And when I, I arrived Memorial Day which means, Memorial Day is April, isn't it? April, school started in the fall, in September. So I had between April and September that I acquired some English by working in my uncle's store. And that way exposed, picking up English. And then I went to college. And when I went to college after the first three days I realized that I couldn't hack it. Because a friend, a boy that was working my uncle's store on weekends who was a senior at college, a Chester boy, he's now dead, but he was a senior. And my uncle asked him to take me around and show me Penn and he prepared the whole roster because I had no conception of what a roster is. I didn't now that I could have the freedom of selecting courses, what courses to select. I only knew that I wanted to be, to go to medical school, to go to medicine. So this boy, by the name of Joseph Soyfer [ph], who became quite a well-known writer, under a pseudonym, he picked out the most, naturally he, being a very good student and having enjoyed, picked out the most famous English courses at Penn. In the first week, the first day was open. Anybody could attend the course of Childs, who was famous for his stories. And everybody was rolling with laughter. And I sat there and I couldn't understand a single word. And then I went to Cornelius Wygand, another Professor of English who was an expert on the Pennsylvania Dutch country. Well, I didn't know what Pennsylvania Dutch meant. Not only did they have stories, and he told stories, and everybody just laughed and I just, I got out crying almost. And then finally, this is the coup de grace. In the afternoon I had signed up for zoology, which was required, a course required for pre-medical. And I walked, if you know Penn, you walk down Hamilton Walk and you come to the last building was zoology. And I came in the afternoon, it was a three-hour course, a laboratory course. And I came to the course and we, there were all the students and then I remember the guy, the instructor's name, Colton, this is 1924. And Colton put something up on the desk and I didn't know what he wanted of us. But later on it was very obvious. He was testing our powers of observation. And he asked us to make a drawing, an outline, and to identify the parts. It was just a test to determine our powers of observation and our knowledge. It was a grasshopper that he had put up. Well, I had seen grasshoppers in Buenos Aires and I'm sure that the grasshoppers in America look exactly the same as in Argentina. But I didn't know that in English it's called a grasshopper and I didn't know that he meant just an outline to identify the parts. And in high school we had one year of drawing. And in that you learn perspective and shadowing and shades and so forth. And in my best Argentine style, I proceeded to draw this grasshopper in all planes, in a three spatial arrangement, but I couldn't name it. And then I went out very timidly and handed this paper to Colton. And he looked at me like I was the man from Mars. And then I realized that I couldn't, I couldn't do it. I came home, got off at Pennsylvania Chester station, it was at 6th and Edgemont Avenue, and walked to 8th and MacIlvane where we were living, and cried all the way down. And I said to my mother, "I don't think I can make it." Well, we had paid all of two hundred and fifty dollars tuition fee for the term. The first thing my mother said, "Well, you'll have to get the money back." Because she had borrowed from her brother. So I went back the next day to the University and to the Dean of Admissions and I explained my predicament. And he said to me, "I'm sorry, we cannot refund. The policy of the University is you never refund tuition fees. But we will give you a leave of absence." And he gave me a leave of absence. He says, "You'll come back the second term, the Spring term." And in the meanwhile, meanwhile I said, "All right, I'll do that." I came back to Chester and I said to my uncle, "I'll work in the store and I'll earn the twenty-five or thirty dollars a week and I'll learn English." Then I went to night school with all the foreigners. All the Greeks and the Italians with their little stores felt in those days it was very stylish to have straw hats and felt hats. And they're doing the cleaning of the felt hats, the Greeks particularly. And here I went to the high school at night to get the English classes for immigrants, for adults. And I see all these neighbors of mine, they are forty, fifty years old, here I was sixteen. And I took all these classes. It was a very interesting introduction that I had because it was a double, almost a double-take picture. When I came to America I was startled. I had expected to find a wild west and instead I found Chester. I saw New York and in Chester, Edgemont Avenue had all these lovely stores, all glass, and no one was worried about larceny. There was not a single iron curtain. In Buenos Aires every store, regardless of how small, always had a pull, what do you call it, iron shutter gate. Here in the stores, with these glass windows, my uncle's store, at 7th and Edgemont Avenue, and I say, "What, anybody can break into the store, break into the windows." He said, "Well, why would they break in? What's the point?" And that startled me. And I said, "Gee, in Buenos Aires, with the iron shutters you closed down, locked up tight for the weekend, you came Monday morning and all the goods were gone. Somebody had come in, thievery is just fantastic. Nothing protects it. And here it was perfectly good, solid, Protestantism morality at work. Nobody steals anything. So that's one aspect, and I was very startled and very, very pleased by it. My uncle, when I started going to high school, that was already in the fall, took me to Philadelphia and bought me an overcoat, wholesale. It was a camel's hair, pseudo camel's hair. And that night I went to the high school, Chester High School and, remember the entrance? It was a big hall with hooks where you put your clothes. And I promptly put my overcoat there, and when I came out of night class my overcoat was gone. My first overcoat that was bought in America was stolen. And that was a terrible shocking experience ( he laughs ) for my tremendous sense before that I was in the, in the Garden of Eden as far as honesty was concerned. The first coat that my uncle bought me for the winter was gone. Again, I cried all the way from 9th and Fulton Street to 8th and MacIlvany, shivering because it was cold without ( he laughs ) a coat. Well, I want to make a long story short, I took every single English they allowed me in high school from, you went to high school, did you go to Chester High School? DALLETT: No. GOLD: Oh, in those days it was a very good high school and they had Miss Feree, Miss Maxwell, and I took every single English course from 10A to 12B, just listened in. So I went through one class to the other. I didn't have to write any reports, they didn't grade me, but that's how I learned. And then at the end of that, the first term, I went back to school. I took my English course, English I, English 40, and composition, English III. The first paper I wrote was "My Experiences on Ellis Island." And I still remember the young instructor, Mr. Thompson, very young instructor, and you'll have to, I'm sorry, Mrs. Gold saved those papers that I had for about twenty to thirty years. After a while I said, "What the devil do you want to fill up the closet with those college papers?" Because I got an A on it. And there was a little note from Mr. Thompson saying, "May I submit this paper for publication to (?)," which was the literary magazine at Penn. Well, now, when I got the paper read to Mrs. Gold it was very, very, it made me laugh years later. Because I was, at that time I was thinking exclusively in Spanish and then translating into English. Naturally, as you know, the English language, a good portion is Latin derivation and another portion is Anglo Saxon. Well, I could use, my English was all Latin derivation. ( he laughs ) So I had these long words. ( he laughs ) Not a single Anglo Saxon word, because I didn't have any exposure except the rough and tumble that I had in the store, which I wouldn't use in my English paper. But I got A's in all my English courses in college and then at the end of two-and-a-half years I got into medical school. And then I graduated medical school first in my class. The epilogue of my experience at Ellis Island is that I had a very satisfying life in the United States. I made it my business to contribute something to the good and welfare of the community. Practiced medicine for fifty-two years in the city. Became a principal figure in the local hospital and teaching institution. Married a lovely lady who was a graduate, a Chester girl, who graduated from the Curtis Institute of Music. And I had two boys. Both of whom were educated in the local schools. At the time we were living in Swarthmore, went to Harvard College, Harvard Medical School, and now are very successful research professors, one of medicine, and the other one of pediatrics. One at the University of California, San Francisco, and the other one at the University of Toronto. And both of them married and I have six grandchildren. All of them working very hard to make this country a bigger and a better country than what they inherited. DALLETT: Thank you for anticipating so many of the questions I would have asked you and that's the end of Side Two of interview number 60 with Herman Gold.
