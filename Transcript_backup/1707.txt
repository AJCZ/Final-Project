Sometime I used to send a little package, you know, because the war, a little package for the kids, you know. HAPEMAN: What, for the kids? TESORIERO: That they could use it. But after that I don't send no more, I think, because it, can't mail it, it was the wartime. And after that when it started again once in a while, you know, I used to stick a couple of dollars into the mail, you know. HAPEMAN: A couple of dollars in the mail. TESORIERO: No correspondence much. HAPEMAN: Okay. TESORIERO: A little (?), no correspondence in the Second War, no, no. You can't write, you can't read, whether no one survive over there. But after that it's peace, we know what's left. I used to send my mother, my father, after that he don't live long. My mother live a few years more. I used to remember to send her something.

TESORIERO: I raise them healthy, and I raise them honest. My husband's three, the first daughter was set to go out, because (?) when they got it. The first thing, listen. "You're taking my daughter out? Eleven o'clock I want them in the door." He did it, he did it. HAPEMAN: ( she laughs ) Very strict. TESORIERO: He did it. HAPEMAN: Good. TESORIERO: Since they got married. The other one, most of them (?), same thing. After a while she was not too long ago, (?) the fiance, they got married, and I have no more worry because they was married. Only one, she don't want to get married. She was a beautiful looking girl. Now she's a little chubby. ( they laugh ) HAPEMAN: Okay. TESORIERO: So, you know, I tell her the truth. How (?), she had beautiful young boys, but in her mind she wants to be an opera singer. She spends a lot of money for this. But today, you know, you got to have luck on everything. She still study! But no luck to get a place they call, like I say, show. And she went a couple of times and made a show and things like that. Not ever a steady job. She had to work for the city to have a steady job. She work about ten years for the city. Now she retire. She retire this year. HAPEMAN: What are your feelings about the United States? TESORIERO: Only happy, because I've always been like, not because I don't know (?), but I know (?). Italy's a nice city, a nice country, but why I coming, and what if somebody has to come on this little island, it was a poor island. You couldn't make a living. Man, like I said, got to leave his family there, they come in here to make a few dollars. They leave the family over there. They can't afford to bring the family over here, because then over here take expensive. They used to live over there, and they sacrifice like two, three, four years with my father the least. They sacrifice to make a few extra dollars. They stay there, but they only get down to what he did, see? That's what it was like. The town, it was beautiful. Nice area, nice ocean, clean ocean, big ocean. But not for making a living. Not to make a living. HAPEMAN: Okay. Well, that's a good place to end the interview. I want to thank you, thank you very much. TESORIERO: You finished? I did everything? HAPEMAN: Yes, everything. Thank you very much for having us over. TESORIERO: Thank you very much. It was worth it for me to say what I have to say. HAPEMAN: Well, it was great. TESORIERO: You're a lovely girl. I wish you lots of luck. HAPEMAN: Thank you. I enjoyed meeting you very much.
