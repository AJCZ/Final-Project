DALLETT: My name is Nancy Dallett and I'm speaking with Mr. Theodore Grob on Friday, November 3rd, 1989. And we're here at Mr. Grob's home in Grafton, Wisconsin, just North of Milwaukee. And we're about to talk with Mr. Grob about his immigration experience from Switzerland in 1921. And unfortunately, there's quite a bit of noise. There will be some hammering going on because the Grobs are having a deck put around their swimming pool in the back, but there's not much we can do about that, so here we go. Uh, Mr. Grob, you came through Ellis Island in 1921 and we talked a little bit before we-- GROB: That is correct. In April, 1921. DALLETT: And can you tell me, what were the circumstances that surrounded your coming to this country? Can you tell me how old you were at the time, and why you decided to immigrate to this country? GROB: I was nineteen and we were dreaming about the beautiful country of America with the wide spaces, with the mountains. And I was talking to my older brother who was an engineer at that time and we were dreaming about owning a farm or a ranch out West. And I'd been dreaming about that for many years, but, uh, somehow I never got there. DALLETT; How did you, what image did you have about America? Why did you have these dreams about wide open spaces and-- GROB: Well, you'd be reading in the papers about people getting land free from the government by staying there five years and establishing a home, and that the common man could get himself where he could earn a good living and have a home and have some land, which was very difficult in Europe. DALLETT: Where did you live? Where were you in Switzerland? GROB: I was living in Switzerland. We were born in Switzerland, which is a beautiful country, buy, uh-- DALLETT: Hold on a second. (They laugh.) What part of Switzerland were you from? GROB: Well, my father was a minister and he moved around quite a bit, different places. But I was actually grown up in Beringen which is North, close to Schaffhausen. Later on we moved to Winterthur, which is not far from Zurich. And, uh, our last place was in Aarau, which is between Bern and Zurich. And, uh, went to technical school there. DALLETT: And was it just the two boys in your family? GROB: Pardon me? DALLETT: Just two boys in your family, your brother and you? GROB: No. We had twelve children. I was the youngest. That is, there was one sister who was four years younger than I am, but three of them died, and so we were ten of us, and I was the youngest of the ten. I remember very well when we were sitting at the table, twelve of us, around the table, eating. And, uh, I guess we educated each other and things were pretty slim once in a while, but actually I don't think we had to go hungry, but we didn't have much, otherwise. DALLETT: And your father was a minister and he didn't have a steady congregation? He would move? GROB: Oh, yes, oh, yes. However, when you have, when a father has twelve children and you have sickness in the family, and those days there was no such things as insurance, I guess there wasn't much left for any luxuries. DALLETT: But you mentioned before that he moved from place to place. GROB: That is correct. DALLETT: And was that because he was a minister, and that's how ministers functioned, by moving around? GROB: Well, I think the moving, we were moving quite a bit, from one village to another, this or that happens, I don't know, may be to better his position. And, on account of children, to be closer to college or schools or whatever. I really don't know. DALLETT: And what was the church? What kind of minister was he? GROB: The, uh, Protestant Church. That the, at that time there were two churches in Switzerland, the Catholic and the Protestant which the ministers were appointed by the government, through the government. This is no longer so. But at that time that was done through the government. And the house was furnished to the minister, but the salary wasn't too big, I guess. DALLETT: Did you know other people who had gone off to this country? GROB: Not when I left, but of course I met lots of people over here that came from Switzerland. DALLETT: But as a boy growing up, you said you had dreams of coming here, but not because people had told you about it. Because you read about it? GROB: Well, we were reading in books and so forth, and-- DALLETT: How about Buehrer, wasn't he here? GROB: Pardon me? DALLETT: Buehrer, here before? GROB: Right. Buehrer, he was a friend of my brother Ernst. He was an architect, and he went to Milwaukee. But he went there, oh, quite few years before I went. DALLETT: So your brother had a friend who had come here to Milwaukee. GROB: Yes, yes. DALLETT: So your brother was an engineer, did you say? GROB: That's right. DALLETT: Did he make the plans to come? Did you come together with your brother? GROB: He was thinking of it, but he never did come. It was only two of us, Ben and I, that came over here. DALLETT: Ben was also an older brother? GROB: He came over two years later. DALLETT: But was he older than you or younger? GROB: He was one year older, yes. DALLETT: So you planned-- GROB: Well, I told you I'm the youngest, so he couldn't be younger. DALLETT: Right, true. (They laugh.) You caught me on that. Uh, but you sort of dreamed about it and talked about it together. GROB: Not to Ben. It was Ernst that we were talking about going to America and having a ranch, but he never did. DALLETT: How did the rest of the family feel about your planning to do this? GROB: Oh, they thought it may be a good idea. DALLETT: Your father encouraged you? GROB: Sure. DALLETT: Your mother? GROB: Mother too, yes. Well, she didn't like me to go, but-- DALLETT: How did you make the arrangements? How did you make it happen? GROB: Well, I had good friends. And, uh, I had a friend who had a job and he loaned me the money to come over here. I think it was some where around three hundred dollars, traveling steerage, and I also borrowed fifty dollars from somebody else because I was told you had to show fifty dollars to the immigration authorities to show that you were not broke. So I had that extra fifty dollars which, after I landed, the second or third day I returned. (He laughs.) DALLETT: Hold on just one second. (Break in tape.) Okay. I just wanted to adjust your microphone. So you borrowed this money. Did you have to go through a series of, get a series of papers, or have medical examinations, or anything like that in Switzerland before you came? GROB: You had to have a certificate of good behavior, or character, or whatever you call it, from the police department, in order to get the visa. And, uh, I don't know that other papers were needed, but I know I went to Zurich to the American Consulate, and no trouble at all getting a visa. You also had to have a visa from France to go through there and I remember there were lots of poor ladies, farmer, sitting in the French, and they couldn't speak any French, and the French consul there doesn't seem to, they didn't want to speak German or anything else, they just talked French. So luckily I had some French in school, so I had no trouble. DALLETT: So you went-- GROB: I got my visa in France right away, too. I don't think I was there more than five or ten minutes. DALLETT: Did you have to go through a medical examination? GROB: I have to get what? DALLETT: A medical examination of any kind that you remember? GROB: I don't think so. No, I don't think so, I don't remember. But you had to testify that you were not a communist, and sign some papers and so forth, and I certainly wasn't. (He laughs.) DALLETT: Now, tell me, I'm sorry, I might be getting confused, but you did have, the friend of your brother's was here, right, in Milwaukee, Ernst's friend. GROB: A friend, a friend of my brother's was in Milwaukee. DALLETT; Okay. Is that the only person that you knew here? GROB: No. I went to Scranton, Pennsylvania and there was a friend from Ernst also, and he was in a hotel, and that's where I went first. As a matter of fact, I didn't go to Milwaukee till two years later. DALLETT: So before you came you just knew these two people. You had two connections. One in Scranton, and one was in Milwaukee. GROB: Correct. DALLETT: Okay. Tell me about what it was like when you made the decision to come, and you had all your papers in order. You then had to say goodbye to your family. GROB: Right. I said goodbye and you go. And, uh, I know that the railroad trip to Cherbourg, where we took the steamer, that was really scary. I mean, that train in France, a number of times I thought now it's going to tip over. I mean, it, it really almost raised, the cars, they were waving back and forth. That was a new experience for me, because in Switzerland the trains don't run that way. And of course you were reading about a lot of train accidents in France. But we got to Cherbourg all right and we got onto the boat. DALLETT: Which boat was it? Do you remember? GROB: It was an English boat from the Cunard Line. DALLETT: And you mentioned before that you loaned, you borrowed three hundred dollars from you friend to come steerage. What were the conditions like that on the boat? GROB: The conditions on the boat were very good. We had plenty to eat. However, there were people from all over, from different countries. And some of them got very, very sick, and they were so sick they were laying on deck and vomiting, were seasick and I didn't get sick. It was-- (He laughs.) I remember now, we had some other Swiss fellows in my cabin. A cabin we had, I think there were six or eight of us in there. It was a large cabin, had one bed on top of the other one. And, uh, this one fellow loaned his razor which, you know, in those days you had those beautiful razor blades, and he had a wonderful razor blade and some other fellow saw him shave in the bathroom and he borrowed that blase. So next day he wanted that blade back, and the fellow said he was sorry, but he loaned it to another fellow, and he didn't give it back to him, and he can't help it, and he never got the thing back. I didn't lose anything, but-- (He laughs.) (Voice off mike.) MRS. GROB: Not much to lose. DALLETT: What did you bring with you? GROB: Pardon me? DALLETT: What did you bring with you? GROB: Very little. I brought a suit I had. I had a little suitcase with underwear and whatever. Very little. DALLETT: And how long was the crossing? GROB: The crossing? I think it was around six days, six or seven days. It was pretty rough. But, uh-- DALLETT: What time of year was it, did you say? GROB: It was April. So when we got there, that's when we got to Ellis Island. DALLETT: Tell me about that. GROB: Okay. Now we talk about the Ellis Island. DALLETT: This is what you've been waiting for. GROB: It so happened that on our ship there were three ladies, if you can call them that, from I don't know what country, whether they're from Czechoslovakia, or where they're from, I don't know where they came from. But they evidently had lice. And they cut their hair off. I saw them. They were as naked as top of the tree, as you could be. They sheared their hair off to clean them up. Now, I don't blame them for doing that-- DALLETT: This was at Ellis Island, not on the boat. GROB: That was on Ellis Island, yes. And, uh, so much for that. I thought that was okay. But they then assumed all of us were contaminated with this or that, and that I couldn't understand. So they took all our clothes and disinfected it. And there was one warden there, he was very nice. I had a nice overcoat and he says, "You give me that, I put it in the closet here." I wanted to know what for. He says, "Well, you don't want to get that spoiled, I'll put that there." So he put it there. But everything else was taken in an oven and disinfected. Now, this oven evidently had liquid on the bottom which was dark brown or black and when I got my stuff back there was one shirt, it was just about black on one side, a little white on the other side. But, uh, it was a lousy mess. But that wasn't the bad thing. The bad thing was that after they took everything off from us and we were in our Adam's suit, we got into a, some kind of a bathroom and they washed us with kerosene from top to bottom. And my eyes were kind of hurting, and there was a white towel hanging on my right side. I assumed that was a towel to wipe yourself off. So I took it and I wiped my face and eyes. And holy smoke, this fellow, he let loose a board of language that sounded like a, jiminy, I don't now. But it wasn't nice. I knew, I didn't understand it, but I had some English in school for two years, but that I couldn't understand. But he was certainly not talking nicely about it. He grabbed the towel out of my hand, and he took a pail of kerosene and flushed it right over my head. And I don't think that was very nice. And that's, that is what I remember from Ellis Island. Well, after that, we got into a great big room where there were lots of beds lined up. And, uh, I must admit, that crowd we had was pretty unruly. When it came to eating, everybody rushed. Well, I'm not used to that, so I just quietly walked up there, and got what was left. So again, evidently, they were giving out blankets so you could cover up. The mattresses were laying on the floor in a long row, and we were assigned one place where you put your earthly goods on top of the mattress, so you were supposed to have a blanket. So everybody rushed to get these blankets. Well, by the time I got there there was no more blankets. So when we retired I lay down a little while without a blanket, but I was cold. So I stood up, and I walked up and down, I thought, "That'll never do." So the guard came, a guard came and wanted to know what was the trouble. And, uh, "No blanket." So he was very nice and he went and got me a blanket. He got me a very nice blanket, and I went to sleep. And that's about it. I don't remember, I know, the point is, on the train they put some tags on us, and, so they had Scranton, Pennsylvania, and what train to take, and next morning they pushed us, took us off, and took us to the train. DALLETT: So you delayed there overnight, then. GROB: Only overnight. DALLETT; Just one night. But there weren't enough supplies to go around for all the people. Was that it? There weren't enough blankets and food? GROB: Well, I don't know. There's, evidently there was, because the guard found a place for me. So, a blanket for me. So, uh, but on the place where the blankets were, and everybody got this, there weren't any left. So I didn't find any at the time. DALLETT; Do you remember, you mentioned before that you had borrowed fifty dollars because you had heard that you had to have this money to come through Ellis Island. Did anyone ask you about the money? GROB: No, nobody asked me about that. They didn't ask me to show it. I don't remember whether they asked whether I had it or not, I don't remember that, either. But, uh, they didn't ask me to show it to them. DALLETT: Did they, did you go through some sort of medical examination? GROB: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That reminds me, that was pretty rough. There was a doctor. Naturally they look in your mouth, and they do this and that. And, uh, in particular they took your eyelid and lifted them up. And I was kind of sore afterwards. They really pulled on there. DALLETT: Pulled your eyelids up? GROB: I mean, they took a stick, like I said, hold it up, you know. And looked in there, and looked in your mouth, and this and that, and everything else. And, uh, they were pretty rough. Now the guards were nice. The guards that I had, they were nice. DALLETT: But the doctors, you found, were rough. GROB: The doctors were rough, and the guy in the bathroom was next to impossible. I mean, how the heck can you take a man and pour kerosene over him. I mean, that's-- And Ellis Island is the only place up to that time, up to now, where ever, ever I was locked up into a place. I was never locked into a place before where I couldn't get out. I mean, you and I can go out of here, and that's it. But we were locked up. Sure, you go on the ship. You can't go anywhere either. But they don't lock you in a room. DALLETT: Was it also difficult because, it must have been hard to know what to expect, or how long you were going to be there. You were speaking what language? GROB: No. O knew that some people, see they told all kinds of stories. They told some terrible stories about mothers with babies, that the baby had maybe something wrong and they took it away from the mother, and after a day or two they bring it back to the mother and say, "Here's you baby." And the mother says, "That isn't my baby!" And they would insist it's here baby. And there were other people evidently that couldn't go, that were there for more than a day and, uh, that couldn't leave. And whether they were sent back or not, I have no idea. All I know is that I stayed one night and that's it. Now, my brother stayed for five nights. He tells some very sad stories. He tells a story about a lady who travelled first class and she couldn't figure out why in the world she couldn't enter the United States. She had a visa, and her passport. Her visa, it was issued in Switzerland by the American consulate. And yet when she got here, they said quotation for immigration was filled. Did you hear that before from others? DALLETT: Not that they were turned away once they got here. No, I don't think I have heard that. GROB: Well, he said there were. Ben, they were staying there for five days, but the only reason that the immigration, that the quota was filled, and that they didn't know whether he could come in or not. In other words, uh, he might have been told, well, you can go back to your ship, and you have to go back. MRS. GROB: He told them he wanted to go home one time, but the ship had gone already. DALLETT: So he was detained for five days. GROB: Well, he sat there for five days and he says that the only place in his life he ever, ever had bedbugs at night, that was there. He had bedbugs. And they were evidently in a rather small room with one bed on top of the other one. Whereas I was-- MRS. GROB: Iron bars. GROB: Iron bars. Whereas I was in a large room with the mattresses laid out all along. There was plenty of room there. DALLETT: So you were in a large room with a lot of people, and he was in a smaller room with-- GROB: They were in smaller rooms with beds one on top of the other one. I didn't, when I was there I didn't see any places like that. DALLETT; And that was a few years later that your brother Ben-- GROB: That was in '23. DALLETT; '23. Do you remember the kind of food that you ate at Ellis Island? GROB: Kind of what? DALLETT: The food that you ate at Ellis Island? GROB: I don't remember, but the food was good. The food was all right. I don't remember. DALLETT; Mostly that awful kerosene. I can't imagine that, the terrible kerosene shower. GROB: Well, we got lice once and we had to have, we washed our hair in kerosene. But only our hair. DALLETT: Yeah. This was to your skin. What did it-- GROB: Well, I mean-- MRS. GROB: It burned. GROB: I came from a pretty clean country, Switzerland, and-- You see, why I think that there should be no memorial for Ellis Island, which is also called the Island of Tears. And the quicker we would forget about it, the better we'd all be off. As a matter of fact, I forgot about it long ago, except that you remind me of it again. MRS. GROB: Well, when you got the letter asking for money. DALLETT: Right. You didn't feel that way about the Statue of Liberty, though. They're two very different things, right? I see you donated for it to be restored. GROB: No. The Statue of Liberty, however, it's kind of strange to look at the Statue of Liberty from a prison, you know. DALLETT: And it was like a prison for you. GROB: Well, what else was it? I mean, you couldn't get out. You were there till they processed you. I mean, you go through customs, immigration anywhere. No matter where you go through it, maybe take half an hour, or two hours, you just walk through. MRS. GROB: We were held up in France. GROB: I remember other times when we, uh, visited Switzerland and came back and we had got acquainted with American friends. And they said that they travelled all over Europe and everywhere they went from country to another with no trouble at all. And here they come back to their own country and they are being harassed. However, that was years ago. I mean, I recently coming in here, it was extremely nice. First of all, surprisingly, you come to the American immigration officer and he says, "Welcome back to the Unites States." Or something like that, which is very nice. And they're friendly, and you go through the customs, and no problem. I think it has much improved. DALLETT; Do you think that, did everyone on this ship that you came on get subjected to this kerosene shower? GROB: All got completely washed, every one of them. MRS. GROB: Well, only steerage, wasn't it? Not first class. GROB: As far as I know, I was badly warned about going steerage. I was supposed to go at least second class. And I says I haven't got the money, and I'm not going to borrow the money for steerage, and so forth. And, uh, so as far as I know, the people on Ellis Island that I saw that time, were only people from the steerage. Now, whether it was second class was there too, second and first class. Did he come second class? MRS. GROB: I think so. GROB: I don't know. Whether first and second class were in there too, I don't know. But if they were, they probably were in a different place. MRS. GROB: Because he said the k\lady there was in first class, and she was the one subjected to all this harassment. DALLETT: Okay. We're just going to flip the tape over now. This is the end of side one of Interview Number 424, [SIC, DP-50], with Mr. Theodore Grob. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO DALLETT: Okay. This is the beginning of side two of Interview Number 424, [SIC, DP-50], with Mr. Theodore Grob. And, uh, we've talked about Ellis Island and we're finished. Mr. Grob is fed up with talking about Ellis Island now. It was a terrible experience for him. And you mentioned you were a little leery about even talking about what happened after Ellis Island. But I've convinced you that I think it's important to hear how it is you ended up in Milwaukee. So let's go from the point where you leave Ellis Island. And I think you mentioned you first went to-- GROB: Okay. They put me on a train and I went to Scranton, Scranton, Pennsylvania where a friend of my brother Ernst, Arnold Aeschlimann, was having a job in a hotel. And so I got the job in that hotel immediately as a dishwasher and I washed dishes for three months, and I think I washed enough dishes for all my life. But, uh, there were two fellows running the place. One was an American and he was very nice and the other fellow was a Greek, and I didn't like him too much. And, uh, several things happened with him and at one time he, we had a little argument and he said, "You go to hell." By that time I had enough English that I could tell him, "You go to hell, you." Well, the waitresses told me afterwards that never in their lives did they enjoy anything like it. By the way, for the first month I had, the total wages for the first month's work, ten hours a day, and having food, was ten dollars. But, uh, after I got the ten dollars, the hotel keeper came and said that I owed him ten dollars for the room. So there was nothing left. So the second month I insisted on getting twenty dollars, so I had ten dollars left. And, uh, the third month, this happened that we had this argument, and I quit. In the meantime there was a policeman who, uh-- DALLETT: Hold on a second. (Adjusts microphone.) Okay. GROB: In the meantime there was a policeman by the name of Murphy who came by the hotel and talked to me every once in a while. And he had a job at his home to dig a basement, a cellar, which he dug to improve his home. And I was working there with him for about two weeks. And after that I got together with some Swiss friends that happened to be in Scranton and they had some money and they bought an automobile. They bought a Hanes, an old Hanes. And we all got together and we're going out West to start a farm out there. So we got as far as Idaho and ran out of money. It was fall by that time, and we helped the farmers thresh, and we got enough money together again to keep on going. So we went to California. In California the man with the money had bought some land with a down payment and we started to build a house and we started to have, we were supposed to start having a farm. But it later on showed that the land which was sold to us was harrowed, not plowed, but harrowed, to a way that you couldn't see the alkali. But after a while the land was plowed with alkali and you couldn't raise anything. So I don't know what happened, but I left with another fellow and we went to Long Beach, California. I mean, naturally it's California, in Long Beach, and we stayed there on the seaside for a few days. And after that I got a job on a farm and I learned to milk cows, and stayed there for two years. By that time my brother Ben came over and he went to a friend of Ernst Buehrer in Milwaukee, and I got the job in different factories. And that was in 1923. DALLETT: What kind of factories did you work in, in Milwaukee? GROB: Oh, let me see. One was Allis Chalmers. DALLETT: What was that? GROB: Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company. DALLETT: What did they manufacture? GROB: And another one was-- Allis Chalmers, manufacturing tractors, farm machinery. Oh, Allis Chalmers is well-known. And I also worked in, for a guy, oh, Allis Chalmers. Anybody knows Allis Chalmers. I worked for a guy in the Freye Company as a design draftsman. And, uh, up till 1929. 1929 my brother and I, having built a home, decided to start our own business, and we started a tool and die business which was very tough to begin with, but we finally prospered. DALLETT; Was that here in Milwaukee? GROB: That was in West Allis. MRS. GROB: That was in West Allis. GROB: West Allis. And in, that was 1929. It was called Grob Brothers. And in 1936 we moved to Grafton and built a plant there and again we prospered and enlarged. And one of out secrets was, besides hard work, that we decided not to have any debts. So we paid off the banks so we didn't have to pay any interest. And we developed the Grob filing machines and band saws, and also built the Grob butt welder. DALLETT: I'm sorry, the what? GROB: Butt welder. B-U-T-T. Butt welder for saw blades. In 1952 my brother and I agreed to disagree and I started my own business, Ted Grob Company and, which is now the Ted Grob Corporation and we developed the Grob drill grinder, which is a very good drill grinder, but due to the high almost impossible price of product insurance we quit building machine tools and decided to build dies for thread rolling machines only. And that is today our business. We employ about twelve people, and we are very successful. I have a nice little company, Ted Grob Corporation. DALLETT: Here in Grafton? GROB: So we are here in Grafton and that's up to date. DALLETT: Now, why did your brother Ernst not come, the one that you had dreamed about coming? GROB: He, uh, he developed the Grob thread rolling machines and he was in Munich by that time. By the way, when Ernst had a job with Saurer, Saurer Manufacturing Company in Arbon, Switzerland, they had a branch in, they had a branch in Munich. And so they sent him to Munich and he seemed to like it there and he started a factory there. But after the was he came back to Switzerland and then started a business in Meilen, which is on Lake Zurich, which is called The Ernst Grob Machine Fabrique. And they prospered very much. And sorry to say my brother Ernst died, what is it, about three years ago, isn't it? Three years ago. MRS. GROB: Yeah. I think so. Four. GROB: And, uh, it's now operated by his daughters and grandsons. And he was very successful in Europe, so he didn't come to this country. DALLETT: But I'm a little confused. Did he develop some of the machines that the Grob Company here manufactured? GROB: He developed the Grob thread rolling machines. DALLETT; The thread rolling machines. GROB: And Ben, my brother, developed and builds now, the gear rolling machines. And these gear rolling machines are saving lots of money. Now, we ourselves developed some new dies with which you can do jobs that were not possible to be done before. MRS. GROB: Not that were done on thread rolling machines. GROB: In other words, we can roll threads with helix angles up to 45 degrees in long rods, which was impossible before. We call these dies combination dies, and that is one of the reasons we are very prosperous. That's about it. DALLETT: So the dreams you had then about the wide open spaces and having a farm here, how did you feel about that? GROB: Well, I was dreaming about the farm all the time. I decided if I ever had ten thousand dollars, then I would start the farm. But after I had the ten thousand dollars, well, maybe I should have twenty thousand. But anyhow I never got to it. I still think it would have been nice but, uh, by the way my wife is from a farm. DALLETT: You're surrounded here by farm country, aren't you? GROB: She's from New York State. DALLETT; Uh, there's a lot of going on out here. (Referring to background noise.) Let's pause a second. GROB: The grinders, that was for grinding the points of drills. A very simple machine, very efficient. But the product liability insurance, and furthermore, you build machine tools and you go and demonstrate it, and you have a lot of nice customers, but you have some that complain. Anything goes wrong, they call you up, and you have to go and repair it. And so you're much better off producing something which you can ship and forget about it. DALLETT; And your customers for these machine tools, are there a lot in Milwaukee? GROB: Our customers are anyone, any manufacturer, most any manufacturer in metal work. Screw machines, any large company. Ford, General Motors, anything. And, uh, and they, most all of them now do thread rolling. And when you do thread rolling you need dies to roll the thread, and that's what we're making. And, uh, we found that we don't need any salesmen because the salesmen only slows up delivery and he, uh, he doesn't know what it's all about most of the time. So we deal direct with the customer, direct with the factories, so we have no expenses for salesmen. Also we had so much business that we don't advertise. We don't want anymore business. On top of that, our prices, the competition complains that our prices are much too low, but we're making good money, so why should we charge more. We could charge more, no question about it. Get it without trouble. MRS. GROB: And pay it right off to Uncle Sam. GROB: And also with dies you have a big advantage in making collections in questionable accounts because sooner or later they need more of them. And if they go somewhere else, pretty soon if they don't pay them either, then they come back to you. And before they come back to you, get anything they have to pay on the old account. DALLETT: Do you, have your children been involved in the business? GROB: Not too much. I have a good man down there, he was an apprentice of mine, and he's learning the business and I let him. He's very good. He repairs machines that nobody else can repair. MRS. GROB: Well, our son is in the business in Colorado. GROB: Right now I have a son in Colorado, by the way. We have a son. Right now he's repairing at Weyerhauser (?), that the Weyerhauser people didn't know what was wrong with it. MRS. GROB: You mean Richard? GROB: Yes. So he worked all day yesterday, and he got it going again. DALLETT; The Weyerhauser Corporation? A machine? GROB: Yes. It has a very complicated electrical system. There are switches, a whole long board. This is fantastic. DALLETT: He's an electrical engineer? MRS. GROB: Well, he could be. He doesn't have that qualification, but he does it. DALLETT; Okay. I think we got what we need. I know you don't want to dwell any more on the Ellis Island experience. GROB: You probably have more than you need. DALLETT; Oh, no. Okay. That's the end of Interview Number 424, [SIC, DP-50], with Mr. Theodore Grob and it is about, what is it, ten past three.
