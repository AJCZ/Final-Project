NASH: Today is November 16th, 1974 and I'm speaking with Mrs. Bridget Jones who came to the United States November, 1923 at the age of nineteen. In those days her name was Bridget Lacknee. OK, Mrs. Jones, where were you born? JONES: I was born in, Ballinasloe, Ireland. And I came... NASH: What was the town like, was it a big place? JONES: Oh no, it was a small --I came from a farm, I came from a farm and then we had some small towns right near where I lived. And I went away to take up a --I went to a store to take up sales work. NASH: How old were you? JONES: Fourteen, fourteen years. So then I had decided --at that time you had to serve your time to learn how to sell, you know, and you had to pay --you had to pay the shopkeeper to employ you to teach you how to sell. Then I used to seek new people who came from America and they were telling me, "Oh, if you were out in America you would be making so much money, you'd have it so nice," and I said, "Oh, I'm going, I'm going." NASH: Tell me something about your family, how many brothers and sisters did you have? JONES: Oh, I have eleven. There were eleven in my family. There were six girls and five boys in the family. NASH: How many were older than you? JONES: I was in the middle of the family. There were five older and five younger. NASH: And your father worked on the farm? JONES: Yes. My father worked on the farm and he also worked on the roads. You know, they used to make the roads like they do here, and he worked on the roads. And my --the rest of the family, after they came home from school, they used to go out on the farm and do the chores that had to be done. NASH: Why did your family decide to send you as an apprentice in the sales? JONES: Well, because there were too many of us home. It was very difficult for my mother to take care of all of us because we were born none after the other and my father had not been in good health. So we used to see these ads in the paper. It was called the Comic Tribune, and this Sunday she was reading, my mother was reading the Comic Tribune, and she seen this ad for a sales girl to go to county Tipperary. so she showed me the ad in the paper so I wrote to the shopkeeper and told him about myself. So he wrote back and then I was --I went there after a couple of weeks and I was employed for some years. NASH: How many years? JONES: Let's see now, I think I left there when I about seventeen that would be three years. And then I changed and I went into the post office, I went into to work at the post office and I was very determined there to come to America when I worked in the post office. NASH: There were things that bad at the post office? JONES: No it was nice there but I didn't have enough of experience, my two sisters worked in the post office. But I figured out that I was going to go to America I'm not going to bother with anymore here, I'm going to go to America, where I have opportunities. NASH: Did you have much education? JONES: Yes I had a good education. We started school at the age of three and I had a very nice education, what I think anyway. One room school house, you know those one room school houses, but we had good teachers. When I decided that I was coming to this country I had a problem, I couldn't get a visa to come here. So I tried very hard, and I tried and tried, and I went to different travel agencies to see if they could get me going. so I went to this local travel agency and she was a Mrs. Noon, I think Mrs. Noon was her name. And she got me going so then I would go --She said to me, "Well, you can go out for six moths, and then by that time you will know if you'll like it or not." So I got ready and I was supposed to take the ship on a certain date, I just forget the date, I have it there in --I have it in my passport and I had to come to the --oh, I guess it was about fifty miles from my home in (?) to the ship. Then I got on the ship with some other people that were leaving Ireland that were coming the same way as I did. And we came on a ship; called the Leviathan. So then we could only --we weren't supposed to stay on that ship very long. We were told that the ship was going to Cherbourg, France. So then we were transferred there from the Leviathan to the Ile de France. And then we came over to New York, we landed, we arrived in New York after about two weeks. So then we were transferred to another ship, it was named the Polk, and then we were left there. After we arrived, we were left there for quite a few days. NASH: Where were you left? JONES: We were left in the ship. And we didn't know if we were allowed to get off or not. See, there was --I don't know really what was going on. So my brother was here ahead of me and he was the one that paid my passage to come out here. He and my aunt and my cousin came down to the boat, we call it a boat, the ship to see me. They couldn't get in to see me so they sent me oranges and apples. They were hollering in at me, "We don't know if you people will be sent back, or if you're allowed to stay. So we'll let you know in a few days." We were there quite a while when we got the word that we were going to be sent to Ellis Island to be --I don't know what they done there. They put you through the mill over there. Eventually I got off the ship and I came to live with my aunt at 48 Moreland Place. NASH: Did you go to Ellis Island? JONES: Yes. NASH: What was there, what happened there? JONES: I forget what happened to me there, I really forget all about that. I'd have to --you know what I would have to do, I'd have to talk to somebody that would remember. NASH: Why do you think you can't remember what happened at Ellis Island? JONES: Well, I don't know. really and truly, you were lined up and you were asked so many questions. NASH: You don't remember any of the questions you were asked? JONES: No, I don't remember. NASH: How long did you stay there? JONES: That I don't remember either because it's so long ago. NASH: Do you remember what it looked like? JONES: I don't, I really don't because when it was over I was so happy to get into my aunt's house and I said, "Oh, now I'm all right, and I'm with my aunt and I'll be all right, I'll get a job in a few days." NASH: How did your family feel, your mother and father, about you going to the United States? JONES: Oh, they felt good. Most of the Irish people, they had so many children, that they figured out that the children, when they were old enough, that they would be all so mature enough to make their own living. They couldn't feel sorry for them, or anything else, because there was no means of making a living in Ireland. NASH: Sounds like, for a girl, you have a lot of independence that they gave you. JONES: I had great courage, that's what I had, I had great courage. So I was only --then I stayed in New York I guess for a couple of years. My brother worked in the stores, in Butler Grocery stores, and he purchased a house on East 56th Street. So I came to live with him. NASH: What struck you about New York? What were the things that were most -- JONES: Oh, New York was very exciting to me. When I was coming home from Ellis Island on the subway I was very slow and I remember, oh I'll always remember this, my aunt got into the subway ahead of me and I had the big suitcase, I was carrying the big suitcase, and I was afraid to get into the subway car, and a man took the suitcase out of my hand and he just pushed it in and pushed me in with it. It was really funny. But I remember in New York, while I lived there, it was very nice. We used to go to dances and we used to have people come in to see us and we, I really enjoyed it very, very much. NASH: Is it strange for you --I guess you started seeing people from all different nationalities and races JONES: Oh, yes. NASH: How was that for you, coming from a little town? JONES: Oh, it was great, and you know my aunt was kind of a tenement house, I lived in, you know, there were a lot of people in that house and she used to tell me to go take a walk by myself until such time as I got work. Take a walk around the blocks and go to church and so forth. So then one day I come back and I went into the wrong apartment, I didn't go in to where I was supposed to. 46 Moreland Place, that's West 125th Street and it's now called Harlem, but it wasn't called Harlem at that time. It's still -- NASH: So you went into the wrong apartment. JONES: I went into the wrong apartment and there was a lady there and she was also Irish and she says, "Oh, you're welcome to America. When did you come over?" And I said, "Oh, I'm just here a couple of days." "Oh," she says, "come in and see me afternoon." She put the kettle on and made the tea and then I stayed with her for awhile talking about Ireland and I then went back to my aunt's. My aunt said to me, "Where were you?" So I said to her, "Well, when I was coming back, after walking around the block, I made a mistake and went into the wrong apartment and I visited the lady upstairs." So she says, "I'm here so long and I've never bothered my neighbors and here you're here only a few days and you're right in with them." She was just teasing me. But I said, "But that's nice, I get to know people like that." But courage is wonderful, there's nothing like it. And when you're young, you don't mind, you don't care what you have to go through if you like it. NASH: Do you remember the Irish Rebellion? JONES: Oh, I remember about the lorries, you know, those big trucks with the English soldiers on them looking for the Irishmen to shoot them down, it was terrible. But I don't remember that much about it because it was 1916, you know, so I don't remember. NASH: What kind of treatment do you think you encountered? I mean, did people treat you better because you were Irish or did they treat you --What sort of experiences? JONES: Oh, better, better. Everyone I met treated me very well, very well. And when I got the --my job as a saleslady and cashiering in Locher's Department store my boss was from Boston. And at that time he was paying most of the sales ladies sixteen dollars a week. So he gave me eighteen. His name was Mr. Morrisy, because he said being that I was an immigrant it would cost me more living with someone else. I thought that was wonderful. So really it was a great experience. But you know in order to know everything I would have to write it down. A cousin came over here with me and she lives in Two Gardens and she would probably remember more than I do. I don't know. NASH: How long did you work as a salesgirl and cashier? JONES: Until I got married in 1928, from 1923 until 1928. NASH: How did you meet your husband? JONES: I met my husband at a dance in Brooklyn. We kept company for a short time and we got married. NASH: Is he from the same county? JONES: No, he's from the south of Ireland, my husband is, Bill Jones, he's from County Clair, Ireland. And then when we did get married we couldn't find an apartment at that time so we had to buy a house. and we just had a certain amount of money, not much money, but whatever he had he put it down on the house. Then we had to get furniture and he had no job, he worked in the building line, and we had no job. The week that we were married his brother and his cousin came from Ireland and they stayed with us and we also had another brother that was staying with my husband's uncle and he came to stay with us and he was the only one that was working. He was a carpenter for the city. NASH: This was your honeymoon. JONES: Honeymoon? I had no honeymoon at all. I worked --I didn't go into business after I was married. I stayed home and took care of the house and they were known as boarders, you know, the fellows that stayed with us. But we had a lot of fun. They all played an instrument. They played the violin or the accordion and we were singing and dancing and we were all, you know, very young, what I'd call very young. We never had any --we never thought about the future. We just said,"Oh well, it's going to get better, it's going to get better." NASH: This is during the Depression. JONES: 1928 we were married and 19 -- we paid the highest price for our house and then I went myself to pick out the furniture and I had a charge account there. I often wonder what the salesman thought about me. I was there all alone at my age picking out furniture for a whole house from John A. Swartz, they had a furniture store down on Livingston Street. We eventually paid for it because my husband got back working again in the buildings and then we got along. Then the buildings got bad again, there wasn't work. So he got into the Plaza Hotel, Fifth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street, so he's there now for forty-one years. NASH: They just sold the Plaza Hotel. JONES: Yes, twenty-five million dollars. That's a lovely hotel. NASH: What does he do there? JONES: He's a store clerk. They take in merchandise and they send out merchandise. He receives merchandise and sends it out and takes care of all that. he still is working, he doesn't like to retire. NASH: How old is he? JONES: He's 72 since last April. NASH: How is it that you didn't work after your marriage? Did you ever think that you wanted to? JONES: Years ago people didn't work after they got married. NASH: Did you want to? JONES: No I didn't. It didn't dawn on me. I thought my job was to stay home because ten months after I was married my daughter was born so that was it. then you're supposed to take care of your home and your children. I don't think there was anyone going to work after they got married. Not like now days, which is very good to go to work and they get a good start in life. But we got along very, very well. NASH: How many children did you have? JONES: Two children. I had --Maureen was born in 1929, February 17, no, she was born the 19th I think, my birthday is February 17th and I think she was born the 19th of February, 1929. Then nine years later I had a son, James. We had two children. They are both married now and living very happily after. Well, that's it, I guess. NASH: Well, do you belong to different Irish social clubs or is your church Irish? JONES: Yes, I do. I belong to our neighborhood Catholic church, Mary Queen of Heaven. I belong to the Rosary Society and I go, at times, to the Irish, they have what they call the Irish Musicians Musical Club down here in Brooklyn. It's on Foster Avenue and 43rd Street. I think it is. And I go there sometimes --they have a social the first Sunday of the moth and I go there and I see mostly all Irish people there. Their children, they bring their little children with the, and they all can play some musical instrument and they dance. They have a few drinks together and they're very happy. NASH: And your husband, does he go? JONES: Oh, he loves dancing. My husband dances. I don't dance much but my husband loves, the Irish dancing, mostly Irish dancing. My husband, he likes dancing, and he likes to meet people, he likes to go out more than I do. He's more of a sport than I am. I kind of stuck to the house too long. NASH: Were you active, or was your husband active in politics? Does he like political clubs? JONES: No. I like that myself, I like to be active in the --I tried to help this election. I went out working for Carey NASH: JONES: Yes, yes I was. Well, my husband has long hours, he leaves the house in the morning at about 7:15 and he doesn't get home until 7:15 in the evening. so he's quite tired when he gets home. He looks at television and goes to bed. Then weekends we take the car and go out visiting or we have somebody in. NASH: Did you ever go back to Ireland? JONES: Oh yes, I have been back three times and my husband has been back, I think, about five times. he loves Ireland, my husband does. NASH: Did you go back to your town? JONES: Yes. I went back but now I don't know anyone over there any more. It doesn't interest me. Ireland is a beautiful country but the weather is not good there, so that's a drawback. But they all seem to be very prosperous over there now. But I still think that there's no place like this country, and I like it here, in fact, I love it here. I wouldn't want to live any place else. I was out in California, my brother moved from Brooklyn out to California during the second world war. He worked for some government agency during World War II. He settled in California and I've been out there. I didn't like it as much as I did New York. I have been out west, I have been out in Ohio, and that's very much like Ireland out there. It's wide open spaces and it's very nice. NASH: Is there anything about New York that reminds you about Ireland? JONES: No, I don't think so. But of course when we did move out here it was like Ireland because we used to have to walk to the trolley car, we used to have to walk to 49th Street. We had no streets and we had no sidewalks, no streets, no sidewalks. We had to wait for about fifteen years, I guess, before we got our streets and sewers and sidewalks. For quite a few years we had to walk to East 49th Street to the trolley car and we used to walk across the lots. We used to walk across the lots for a shortcut to get where ever we were going. But now it's all built up. NASH: Do you ever meet people who just recently immigrated from Ireland? How do they compare to the people that you immigrated with in your time? JONES: Yes I had a niece and a nephew that I took out here. Now they are living in California. My niece is a trained nurse, she trained in England and came out here then. They are very much different to us, when we came out. They are more like Americans. They have a lot of schooling over there now. They have prepared them better for life. They have technical schools, business schools and they have very good colleges. As you know, it's supposed to be the Isle of Saints and Scholars, Ireland. It's supposed to be, so they're really very developed today from when we come out here. I'm very glad really, I'm glad they are because they had been --I heard somebody say years and years ago that the Irish weren't supposed to apply for a job, they wouldn't get it. NASH: When did you become a citizen? JONES: Oh, I have it in my citizen papers, I don't know. I would have to take them out. NASH: How long did you wait? Quite a few years? JONES: Oh, quite a few years I waited, I waited quite a few years. I don't know why but the time went by. NASH: Were you married? JONES: Yes, I was married. I remember it was a few days before Christmas that I got my citizens papers and I was very, very happy. But my husband was always after me, "Why don't you go and see about your citizens papers?" So I just thought --I have them upstairs, you know, the papers. NASH: What was the ceremony like? JONES: I had to purchase a book and study in order to become a citizen and I done that, and it was very nice. We had a very nice judge. He was a --he had a good natured looking face. And if you stuttered or stumbled a little bit, well, he'd say, "Or NASH: Were the questions hard? JONES: No, they weren't difficult at all. Because I really studied the book and I made sure that I'd have all the answers when I went there. But naturally you're a little nervous. NASH: How soon afterwards did you find out that you were a citizen? JONES: I guess about a month afterwards they sent me my citizenship papers so that I could vote and, you know, then you feel good. You feel good when you get your citizenship papers. NASH: Okay, thank you.
