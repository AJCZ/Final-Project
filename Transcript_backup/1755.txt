VARTIAN: It’s about three or four stories high. You walk in and there’s a big hallway, with big rooms. Way in the back there’s a big room where we used to dry umbrellas, I remember that. Used to open the umbrellas and lay them there, and, and there’s a platform, and that’s where we used to go out and play, kids. And, and that’s the first floor. The kitchen was on the first floor. Kitchen was the first floor. And old fashioned tuniers [PH]. You know what tunier is? OFLAZIAN: What is that? VARTIAN: Tunier. It’s a hole in the ground with the, with the (he pauses), with the tile.

OFLAZIAN: To bake what? VARTIAN: Bake bread. They stuck it against the side. OFLAZIAN: And did you like that? VARTIAN: Yeah. It was good. Delicious. OFLAZIAN: What other things they use to bake in the tunier? VARTIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: What other things they use to bake in the tunier? VARTIAN: Well, now you’re asking me too many questions that I don’t know. I suppose, only two, three years old. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember playing with your brothers? VARTIAN: Not much. Not much. My younger brother was too young. He was about a year, year and a half old. Older brother, he was about two years older than I am. And that’s about all. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember going to church? VARTIAN: I remember the churches. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. There’s one big Armenian church over there. It’s old looking in a big Turkish town right down below, below the, the walls down below where the Turkish town is. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember the name of the church? VARTIAN: No. I know it was a very big church. OFLAZIAN: How far the church was from your house? VARTIAN: Oh, I don’t know. How am I going to know that? I was just about a kid. We walked, or we rode, or we rode in a, in a cart, in, in the carriages, or what, I, I don’t remember. OFLAZIAN: Who went with you to church? VARTIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Who went with you to church? VARTIAN: The whole family. OFLAZIAN: You remember celebrating Christmas over there? VARTIAN: No. OFLAZIAN: Or Easter? VARTIAN: No. I don’t remember. I know the holidays. Holidays. But I, I don’t remember what, they were Christmas, Easter, or what, I don’t know. I can distinguish him today, but I didn’t know anything, any difference at that time. OFLAZIAN: You remember going to school? VARTIAN: Over there? No, I was too young. I, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I, I think they sent me to kindergarten. They used to go, start you very young, just kindergarten. Just kindergarten, that’s all. OFLAZIAN: You remember what the kindergarten looked like... VARTIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: ...in those days? Can you describe me? VARTIAN: What? OFLAZIAN: Can, do you remember the, your days... VARTIAN: Kindergarten, no. I know there were a bunch a kids in there. They just, I don’t know if they taught us any reading or writing, I don’t know that. I have forgotten it. It was, remember I was only two or three years old. OFLAZIAN: You said that your father was in a business... VARTIAN: He, he, he and my grandfather were together in the, in the gold mining business. OFLAZIAN: From where they used to mine the gold? VARTIAN: Oh, I don’t if they mined it. I think they bought from other people. Other merchants. OFLAZIAN: Who were these people? VARTIAN: Oh, I don’t know. No. That I don’t know. OFLAZIAN: And how did you see his business growing? VARTIAN: Oh, I wouldn’t know. OFLAZIAN: Have you ever went to his business place? VARTIAN: Yeah. I went there once or twice way down in the market place. In a dark place. He had just a small office like over here, that’s all he had. Small office and a safe. I think there was a safe way in the corner. Out, outside of that I don’t know anything about it. OFLAZIAN: Was it safe, his business place? VARTIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Was it safe, his business place? VARTIAN: Yeah. It was, it was in the Turkish closed market. Closed market. OFLAZIAN: Why you say closed market? VARTIAN: Well, it’s, it’s covered over, roof, roof on it. Yeah. That’s all, all I remember. You remember, you must remember I was only two, three years old. You shouldn’t expect me to remember all of that. OFLAZIAN: I understand that. VARTIAN: Yeah. OFLAZIAN: What, what makes you to come to America? VARTIAN: Oh, well, we didn’t come to America directly. We went to Sivas, in Turkish, and a few other places, and finally ended up in Istanbul, Turkey. OFLAZIAN: Why did, why did you go to Sivas? VARTIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Why, why... VARTIAN: Oh, I don’t know. My mother found a job in, in a Turkish hospital. In a Turkish hospital. And then we just traveled. OFLAZIAN: So you were in the military hospital working along? VARTIAN: No, my mother was. Not me. Not me. I was just a kid. OFLAZIAN: Where was your father that time? VARTIAN: He was dead. He was shot. He was killed by the Turks. OFLAZIAN: So he was shot and killed by the Turks before you went to the military place to work... VARTIAN: My, my mother work in the hospital there. OFLAZIAN: And then what happened. VARTIAN: We came to the United States. First, we had two, three other aunts. One of them was also working in the military hospital. But it was in some other portion, portion of Sivas. OFLAZIAN: And after Sivas, where did you go? VARTIAN: After Sivas, (he pauses) I think we, we went to, let me see if I can’t think of the other name. A big house that belonged to my mother aunt. White house. It was Samsat. Samsat. We, we stayed there just a very short time, and then we moved on. You were asking me too many details in which you shouldn’t expect a two, three year old kid to remember. OFLAZIAN: And then, therefore how did you manage to come to America? VARTIAN: Oh, we, we stayed in Istanbul for, for two, oh, wait a minute. No, no, no. I was about, I was about eleven, eleven and a half. My mother worked in the U.S. Military. Not military. Naval hospital in Istanbul. And she managed to get the, the hospital doctors to, all them to write letters to, as far as I can remember, write letters to the, the consulate, you know, making it easier for us to come the United States. Of course, at that time, my, my youngest aunt was married to an American citizen in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the one that made, wrote, or got all the papers ready for us to move over. And the money, I, my mother inherited some, some three or four thousand dollars from my father’s insurance with the New York Life. New York Life, American company. In the old, in old, in old Shabin Karhisar. OFLAZIAN: You mean that New York Life was that insurance company? VARTIAN: Yeah, yeah. It, you must not, because my mother hadn’t any insurance. OFLAZIAN: And then, how, how did you leave Istanbul? VARTIAN: Just by boat. We’ve got the passport and everything ready, the papers, and then they just ‘shoo,’ got into the boat, and then we came. OFLAZIAN: From where you took the boat? VARTIAN: From Istanbul. Yeah. OFLAZIAN: Where did you go? VARTIAN: Istanbul, we went directly to New York, New York Harbor. OFLAZIAN: Did... VARTIAN: It was a Greek, it was a Greek ship. King Alexander. OFLAZIAN: From where you take the King Alexander? VARTIAN: Istanbul. OFLAZIAN:Okay. When the ship arrive to New York port, do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? VARTIAN:Ah, that I don’t remember. See, there so many things, newer, newer things, you don’t remember all of them. We got off the boat, we came to, to New York City. There they already had an apartment for us. OFLAZIAN:Excuse me. The ship Alexander arrive to New York. VARTIAN:Yeah. OFLAZIAN:Right. And then, how did you get to Ellis Island? VARTIAN:How did we get the Alexander? OFLAZIAN:To Ellis Island. VARTIAN:Oh, oh. All right. The ship stop at New York City, and then they, oh. The next day they let us off. But the next they must have had some error or some mistakes in the shuffling of the paper, so they thought they made a mistake. They threw us, they took us back to Ellis Island. For one night. And we stayed there one night, and then they corrected everything. And the next they turned us loose, we came back to New York and, and, that’s all. OFLAZIAN:Was the ship crowded? VARTIAN:Huh? OFLAZIAN:Was the ship crowded? VARTIAN:Oh, I guess so. You, there you ask me details again. For a little boy anything more that ten people is crowded. OFLAZIAN:Do you remember going through medical examination in Ellis Island? VARTIAN:I don’t know. I, I knew they took us to room to room. I don’t know. OFLAZIAN:So, you said you stood in Ellis Island for one night. VARTIAN:Yeah. OFLAZIAN:Where did you sleep? VARTIAN:Oh, I don’t, they had a, dormitories, or someplaces over there we slept. OFLAZIAN:Do you remember what did you eat? VARTIAN:Huh? OFLAZIAN:Do you remember what did you eat? VARTIAN:Oh, eat, I don’t know. American food, I guess, or, or is Armenian food. I don’t know. I don’t remember. OFLAZIAN:Who came to Ellis Island to meet you? VARTIAN:Oh, my, my uncle. My, my youngest aunt’s husband. He was the one who made the affidavits and all that paper ready for us to come. See, he used to live in Providence, Rhode Island. He was a tailor. He was a customs tailor. Good. Good standing. And he was the one made all the papers ready. He brought us to the United States. And, as I said, there was some sort of mix up in the papers, and they thought they made a mistake, so they took us back to Ellis Island. And then we stayed there one night, and then we, we came back, we came, they said, turned us loose, we came back to New York City again. In Ridgewood. Ridgewood. OFLAZIAN:How did you get to Ridgewood? VARTIAN:I don’t know. By, by car, taxi or something, I don’t know. OFLAZIAN:What was your expectations from America? VARTIAN:From a two year, three year old boy, I, no. You ask me... OFLAZIAN:You were eleven years old by then, right? VARTIAN:Oh, oh, yeah. When we came from the United States. Yeah. You’re right. You’re right. Oh, I don’t know. I suppose we all expected a lot. Especially on, on board the ship, saw a lot of luxuries and things like that. Expected more of them. OFLAZIAN:What did you see in New York City that you were never seen before? VARTIAN:Big tall buildings, like that. Lot of automobiles, and all that. OFLAZIAN:So, after Ellis Island you went with your... VARTIAN:I went, Ridgewood, New York, Ridgewood. There, there we lived there for, for, for, oh, until, until just recently.
