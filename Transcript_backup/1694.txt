DANE: This is Debby Dane and I'm speaking with Victor Tartarini on Friday, November 22, 1985. We're beginning the interview at 3:30. We're about to interview Victor Tartarini about his immigration experience from Italy in 1920. He was approximately twelve years old. Can I call you Victor? TARTARINI: Well, naturally. I love that. Now, don't call me "Mister." I get crazy. DANE: Victor, can you tell me where you were born, and what kind of town it was? TARTARINI: Well, I was born in Finalemlia [PH], Provincia de Modena. It was only a small town. The province is of Modena. Modena is near Bologna, Ferrar and Milano, you see. And, uh, it was only a small town and, uh-- DANE: What did people do there? Was it in a mountain town or just-- TARTARINI: No, no. I was down on the mountain, you know, down. And I, uh, well, I really don't, well, we have, we had farmers and we had, uh, uh, a place where they grow grapes, you know, make vino, Italian wine. And, uh, of course, when my mother died I went to live with my aunt. And because my uncle had a grocery store, and he used to make bread.. I used to get up at three o'clock or four o'clock in the morning and go down a bakers' shop and help him with the bread so he could have the bread early in the morning. You know, that's all night work, you know, when you do bread, you know. Then, of course, in the daytime he used to have a grocery store and I worked with him about an hour or two, the most, then go to sleep for two hours and I'd go to school. So, you know, I went to school, the first grade. I'm talking about first grade now, see. And, uh, well, do you want to know about my life? DANE: Yes, I do. TARTARINI: My father came in this country when I was three years old and my mother was pregnant. My brother was born after my father left Italy. DANE: Did you have any other brothers or sisters? TARTARINI: Yes, my little brother. DANE: Who was going to be born? TARTARINI: No, no. He came with me. My father went all alone because his father was here already and his stepmother was here already, see. My grandfather got married twice. The first wife died and then he married a second time. So my grandfather got married again, he came to America. So my father came to America to make money, to send us, to send us the passport and everything so we could come in this country. Because, you know, they didn't have no money in those days, you know. Okay. So I went to live with my aunt and uncle. They had four children. And, uh, after a year or two or three, I forgot, he sent a passport, sent the money for me and my mother and my brother Gino to come in this country. So my mother dressed me up, she dressed my brother up. Already, the second week she died, before we left, with pneumonia. She died. So, naturally, we were alone, so my aunt took us in, because she was my father's sister. So we stayed up there, and then the war, the 1918, '16 or '18, the war started. First World War, I'm talking about. And because my uncle went to, to war in Italy, and my aunt ran the store and I used to help her to run the store, you know, just a little small grocery and, uh, she didn't make bread then because they couldn't get flour and things. We used to go down the square, they had dark bread there. We used to buy it up there, you know. She used to buy it. I was too small, you know. But I remember how she used to bring that dark bread, see. Because we used to, my uncle used to be a good baker, he used to make beautiful bread, you know, that Italian bread, you know, and eat, from light to black was a big difference for us, you know. Well, uh-- DANE: When you couldn't come because your mom had passed away, were you disappointed that you couldn't come, or were you glad you couldn't come to America? TARTARINI: Well, I was too small to know anything. I was an altar boy in Italy. As I was singing Ave Maria in church I saw my aunt come in church. She closed the store, but I didn't know it, and I saw her in the second booth or third but I forgot. And I, I was small, but still I sensed there was something wrong because she was crying. see. I didn't know she was crying, because she used to love to hear me sing Ave Maria, you know. Ave Maria is a song that sometimes is, you know, it makes it a little touchy, see. So then she told me that my mother had passed away, see. And, uh, so she took me over the house and that's how, she sent me to school, you know, and cleaned the stores, cleaned the church, had candles, you know, clean all around, do things like that. And in the meantime, my father had to save a lot of money for that, see. So the money, the passport, and everything else, I don't know if he got back or not, you know. Well, in the meantime, the war was over, my uncle came home, started our life again, bakery and blah-blah-blah and blah-blah-blah. And after two, three years, I think it was, two, three years or four years, Mussolini came to power. One morning we were all asleep, all the Fascisti, all the soldiers, you know, come out of cellars, come out of the church, and they were hiding there for that day to-- DANE: Surprise and get you. TARTARINI: The band and everything, you know. And, uh, uh, well, they were marching around the little town and there was a lot of fighting, you know, fist fighting and women fighting because Mussolini was Fascist, and my little town was more Socialist. You know what I mean, labor people are more social ambition or, they used to love the king, Victorio Emanuelo. You know, they used to love the king. And then that guy came to power, you know, you know. So it was a little, a little fighting. You know, it's just like a democrat and republican, you might as well say, but it was a big difference, you know. And so that's it. And, uh, and after the World War-- DANE: Did you start getting letters from your father? TARTARINI: Well, he used to send my aunt five to ten dollars a month sometime, or maybe, maybe more, but I couldn't tell you because my aunt took us, care of us. She used to read letters, you know what I mean. I was small. I didn't know what it was all about, but she used to tell me, uh, your father wrote me a letter and he's feeling fine and he's working and blah,blah, blah, blah, your uncle in Italy, I mean america, they're all fine and Grandma is fine. Uh, she used to tell me all these little things, but she never told me how much my father would send or things like that because it was, you know, it wasn't my business, I was only a kid. DANE: Did you have any idea of what America would be like? Did you have any image of-- TARTARINI: Well, I tell you. America's a big deal in Italy those times, beautiful thing. Because when they sent the letter or a picture, like my uncle John Fortini [PH] got married with my aunt and they sent the wedding picture. He had a tuxedo on and my aunt had a beautiful gown. When we saw the tuxedo and her with all the beautiful white veil, it was a big deal. We thought they were so darn rich that, uh, so everybody thought everybody was rich in America, you what I mean. And I'll tell you one thing, as I got older, a lot of people, uh, they brag about America now, a big (?), and like that. A little bit lie and a little bit was true, you know. But us people, us poor people, we thought an American was, you know, like till I came up here, you know, and I really love America, don't get me-- But the Italian people, uh, they thought that America was gold-- DANE: Gold in the streets. TARTARINI: That's it. That's it, see. They thought everybody was rich in America. Nobody has to work. (They laugh.) DANE: And then, so then you were still with your aunt and uncle. When did it, when did it, you find out that you could come with your brother? TARTARINI: Well, wait a minute. DANE: Yeah. Sure. TARTARINI: My father went to war in this country. My father went to war in this country. So naturally he couldn't take us, you know. And there was nobody to come in this country to take us over because we were small, you have to have somebody to sponsor you, you know what I mean? I mean, I don't know if you call it sponsor, but somebody to bring you over. Well, then he went to war, my father, America. He was a corporal in the Unite States Army. So, naturally, that made us American citizen. When he went to war, made us American citizen the old country, see. And then, after two years he came back from the war, he got married again because, you know, my mother died. And he thought by getting married, having a woman, after two children coming to America, would make it easier for us, you know. So that's what he did. He got married again. But, wait a minute. I never saw my father. I never saw my father when I was, I didn't know what ny father looked like. We didn't have no picture in Italy of my father, see. The only picture I had, after the war, they send one with his uniform on. And he didn't have no moustache, he didn't have no moustache, just like I am now. I'll tell you the story afterwards, how I met him. Okay, so after he got married, he married this woman from, well, she was born in this country and then she went back to her home town, Genoa. She was a, her father and mother came from Genoa. And she stayed up there, I'm telling you my stepmother's life now. Uh, after she was ten or twelve years old, or fourteen years old, one of here uncle came in this country, and she came with her uncle. See, she left her father and mother up there because I think she was three or four years old when she left, but still she loved America. Somehow she, she knew what America was, somehow she knew it, you know what I mean. So anyway, she came to America when she was a young girl and blah, blah, blah. She stayed with her uncle, and then she got a job. Uh, she used to work for the St. Leonard Church in Boston. She used to do the cooking for the priests, see. She used to be a wonderful cook, see. She used to be a wonderful cook. She used to make what they call (Italian phrase), spaghetti by hand, she used to make sougaro, tortellini, they call in Italian. She was a terrific cook, see, so-- Well, anyway, when we came in this country, she, uh, I tell you first and then I'll, okay. My father sent the money, the passport. In the meantime, my uncle John that was here, his brother was going to come in this country. He was a young fellow. So he took us in America. DANE: So you had someone, an adult, to bring you. TARTARINI: Yeah. We had to have because, you know. So, uh, we had to take a train, (name of home town), and go in Genoa. That would take about six days or seven days or maybe a week or two because from Genoa they stop in different city to pick up different people, you know. Sometime they stayed four, five hours, a train, or like that, you know. And, uh, then we went from Genoa, we stayed there four, five days, we took the ship. Then from Genoa was had to go Napoli. They had to pick up some more people in Napoli. Then from Napoli they had to go in Sicilia, Sicily. Then they picked up some more people in Sicilia. And then I think, I think they stopped in Portugal, too, to get, or Spain, I forgot, because, you know-- DANE: You're right. I think they probably stopped in Gibraltar. TARTARINI: Eh. So they had to pick up some people. So, in other words, it took me about a month and a half to come up here, see. DANE: Do you remember the day you left your aunt? TARTARINI: No. I don't. I'll tell you, that's one thing , I really don't. But it's easy to figure out because I, I came in this country in 1921 I think it was, or '22, see. And it was pretty hard. I say it took a month and a half, so I left a month and a half to the time I landed in New York, because I came to New York, October 13th, Columbus Day. It was a big deal. Colombo, Colombo, you know. In Italy we read in school about Colombo discovered America, and we thought oh, an Italian discovered this country, was a big, big deal for us kids, you know. When I saw the Statue of Liberty, oooh, you know what I mean. We saw the Statue of Liberty, it was something beautiful. I knew I was in America, you know. I knew I was going to see my father. I knew I was going to see my stepmother, I had somebody to love, you know, close to me, see. DANE: Did people get all excited when-- TARTARINI: Oh. come on. They used to, uh, they start singing La Tarantella, (sings a few words of Tarantella in Italian), you know, they used to sing Italian, dancing around and hollering, you know. Some it was umbriago, the drink, they were getting wine, you know. They were having a beautiful time. Because I was a little kid. I used to watch them, you know. And of course we slept in third class, you know, down, down. I had, my brother was in the bottom and I was in the top. Uh, uh, we were poor, you know, everything was poor with us, you know. Because up top there they had, you know, a little ritzier and a little better than I did. But I was already no longer, you know. But they fed us beautiful. Of course, my brother was always seasick. And I got seasick on the ship, too. A lot, see. And, uh, because this fellow who took us over was a wonderful person. He used to put us to bed, then he'd go upstairs and dance with the girls. You know, they, the guys had the card game they used to play up top, and he used to go up there and dance and things like that, you know. And then, of course, we came in this country. DANE: Oh, before you go, do you remember getting on the train? TARTARINI: Oh, yes. Oh, it was a big deal. Oh, my God. Soon, I couldn't get up the steps, you know, and then the conductor was going, "Andiano Bologna. Andiano, boom, boom, boom," you know. It was a big deal to me, you know, it was a big deal, going here and going there. As soon as the train stopped we went, I would say, about three, four, five miles. Then my brother started throwing up, because he wasn't used, we wasn't used to the train. But to me it was a big thrill, (he pounds his chest with fist), it was a big, you know, the train, oh, boy. Then we went up the mountains, you know, you got get through the mountains, through the-- DANE: The tunnel? TARTARINI: Yeah, the top, and then they go under, between the mountain, you know. DANE: Yes, in the valley. TARTARINI: Yeah. In the valley. And you come out, it was something beautiful that I never saw before. I never saw a train until they took us in Ferrara and get the train, you know what I mean. And, uh-- DANE: Was it loud? Some people remember the sound of the train being so loud. TARTARINI: No, there was no train in our place. We had to go in Ferrara, or Bologna. DANE: But when you caught the train did it seem loud to you? TARTARINI: Oh, yes, oh, my God. Boom, boom, boom, oh, yeah. And those train, they ain't like American train today that they're gliding today. But there, you know, the old train, the old steam train, you know, just like a rowboat, you know what I mean. That's how my brother got seasick, and I got seasick, trainsick I would say, not seasick. Trainsick. DANE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And then, um, on the boat ride, you remember being down in third class, and your uncle would go up, they'd play accordions? TARTARINI: Yeah. Oh, they'd play accordion and people had a, a mandolin. A lot of Italian people likes mandolin, accordion, guitar. They used to dance every night upstairs, singing, blah, blah, blah. Then, once in a while, they used to come down, some of the fellas. Little (Italian phrase), you know, happy, you know what I mean? It was a happy family, like, you know. Everybody was so happy to come in this country that, uh, uh, it was a joy to us, you know, it was something special, you know. It was another world. DANE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Everyone was excited-- TARTARINI: Oh, they were all excited. Of course, when you leave Italy, though, you do cry leaving people, leaving behind people that you love, like my aunt and uncle. I didn't know where I was going. I was only a small, but still I didn't want to leave them, you know. But in my mind I'm going to see my daddy, you know, my father was a beautiful deal, and that he was a soldier in this country. (He gasps.) You know, it was beautiful to me. It was something that I would never forget. DANE: I don't know if you remember, it doesn't matter if you don't, but did you used to sing songs as a kid? Do you remember any? TARTARINI: Oh, I remember a lot of songs. DANE: Well, maybe when we finish you might sing me a song. TARTARINI: Oh, no! (He laughs.) DANE: Well, we'll think about it. TARTARINI: Okay, okay. DANE: So then you came in and you saw the Statue of Liberty and then you came to Ellis island. TARTARINI: That's right. We went downstairs. Oh, I forgot just how we went down. But we went up there, there was a lot of doctors, lot of booths, you know what I mean. And then we had to go through an eye doctor, then you go in an other booth, you get another doctor for your physical, you know what I mean. Eye and ear first, I think, and then another one would check your body, you know. And, uh-- DANE: Do you remember the eye doctor? Did he flip your eyelids? Do you remember-- TARTARINI: Oh, yeah. Eyelid, and he put a light on, like they do here when they check your eyes here, the same thing. They had, they didn't have the machine they have here, you know, but he had that thing that looks in, and looks up the nose with a little light. And he, you know what I mean-- DANE: And your hair, did they check your hair? TARTARINI: Oh, wait a minute. No, they-- It was the law, they had all my hair off before I took the boat, because some of the people had bugs, they had little bugs, you know, see. So they go click, click, click, went the barber, took everything off. DANE: Your brother too? TARTARINI: My brother too. We were baldy, baldy. (They laugh.) DANE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Did a lot of the other kids on the boat also have their heads shaved? TARTARINI: Well, I'll tell you the truth. Where I was wasn't many kids. You know, maybe one or two. Maybe on top. We never went on top, you know. We were only allowed I think it was the first balcony, if i"m not mistaken. And then we, we didn't go up very much. We stayed, laid down most of the time, me and my brother. And I was near my brother all the time because he was sick. He was a real sick boy, see. But the fellow who came with us, Carlo Fortini [PH], he was awful good to us, you know, clean his mouth and wash his face, and I did the same thing, you know, because my brother was small, once in a while he wet his pants, change him and things like that, you know. Uh, he was a sick boy, a very sick boy, very. DANE: A lot of people got really-- TARTARINI: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I was sick too, but not as sick as him. I, after two, three, four days I snapped out of it, you know. Only sometimes if I have a, if I had a load of spaghetti or whatever I ate and I, uh, I would go upstairs for a second, the boat would go like that, then I had to turn back, like, you know, I'd throw up, you know, see. You had to get used to, you know, I never was in a merry-go-round or things like that. You know, it's a different world, see. It was a different world. DANE: And your body's not used to it. I've never been through that. TARTARINI: No. That's right. Your body, and everything. Even the train, like I told you, my brother got sick like a dog because we never was in a train. We never was in an automobile. They didn't had an automobile up there. My uncle had a donkey with a cart. You know, we used to deliver bread with the, the donkey and a cart, you know. Uh, they didn't have no cars then. And then, maybe the rich people in Bologna, Modena, maybe they did. ut around my town, they didn't have no cars then. No, no, no. The only time I saw a car it was in this country when I came, when I came in South Station. And I, we went outside, and I saw the cars like the old Ford, you know, the first Fords, T-Fords, you know what I mean. But, uh, I was so surprised, I'll tell you. It was unbelievable. What, what amazes me there, though, was when I went, when I went in, uh, in New York, I had to go to the bathroom. I may as well tell you the truth. DANE: Yeah. Go ahead. TARTARINI: In Italy we had, uh, the bathroom outside, you know, outside, you know. We didn't now where, well, we went in the bathroom and my uncle, and Carlo Fortini [PH] come in with me, you know, because he was afraid that somebody would steal us or something. When I got there and, I don't know who it was, somebody said, "Pull the chain." What the hell was the pull the chain? I didn't know what the hell the chain was, you know. So they showed me how to pull the chain. It was a big deal for me. They had a box on top there. It isn't like today. They had boxes on top, you know, for the chain. Then it was electric lights. I put the switch on. In Italy we only had lamps and candles and see the light goes on. Oh, I said, that, that, that's it. I mean, it was a real big deal. It was a big deal, see. DANE: It was like magic, really. TARTARINI: It was magic, it was magic. That's right. So, we, I think we stayed there about, about a day and a half-- DANE: On Ellis Island? TARTARINI: Yeah. I think it was a day and a half or two days and then , uh, they call our name. DANE: Where did you, before you leave, do you remember where you slept, what that was like? Did you sleep on benches or beds, or, can you remember? TARTARINI: It was benches, I think. But I think we only slept one night, if I'm not mistaken. You know, it's so, when you get in a place like that there, you're so confused that you see lights , you see people walking around. I never saw things like that, you know what I mean? And, uh, uh, you know, you want to see everything, it's so amazing, you know. It was a different world. It was a different world. DANE: And could you hear all different languages, people speaking-- TARTARINI: Oh, yes, yes. Oh, it was Spanish, French, you know, maybe Jewish people too, they talk Jewish, you know. Because I didn't know what Jewish people were in Italy. The only thing we, there's all, mostly Catholic up there, you know. We had a few Protestant, you know, like the teacher was a Protestant, you know, a wonderful person. Uh, but, men teacher. Up there in Italy the men goes, the boys goes on a boy's school, the girls go in a girl's school. They do not mix up there, see. And you have men for teacher, see. DANE: Did you, when you were on Ellis Island they put you through the medical exams and that type of thing. TARTARINI: Oh, yes, yes. DANE: Did you ever know, or were you frightened that you might get sent back to Italy? Did you know-- TARTARINI: Oh, yes, naturally. One day, when my brother had that infection in his eyes they were undecided, you know. And them, uh, I don't know if they were going to send him back or not. Then we showed him the paper, we were American citizens, they couldn't do it. You know, we was American citizens because my father was, like I told you. we a soldier, see. So we were American citizens in Italy. As soon as we landed here we were American, period. DANE: Were you afraid, though, for a little while? TARTARINI: Oh, I was. Oh, yes. I was worried to separate with my brother because, my God, I would have died, you know what I mean. Uh, uh, he was my brother. Hey, come on. He was the only one I loved, you know. Well, anyway, we stayed there but on a, I think it was overnight. Then, the next morning, they call our name because Carlo did most of the thing for us. You know, he was older, showed the papers and things like that, you know. And then they called out, "Fortini [PH]! Tartarini! Victorio Tartarini! Gino Tartarini." So we went and it was big hall, we came out from a little hall, I think it was, with benches. We come out, this fella came in front of me, he says, "I'm your father." So I looked at him, you know, I never saw him, "I;m your father." The other one says, "I'm Your Uncle John." I could tell Uncle John because he and a big nose, you know what I mean, and I saw the wedding picture that I told you, with a tuxedo on. So I knew I was in good hands, okay. So my father say, "Follow me," in Italian, "Vieni." (Italian phrase.) And as we went along, this black man, he, he was a porter. He says, "Can I take your suitcase?" I dropped one, and I started running. My father says, "Come over here." (Italian phrase.) Then he told me all about it. "Don't be afraid," he says, "You know, those are people like you and I," and, you know, things like that. DANE: Were you surprised because you'd never seen a black person? TARTARINI: No. I was so surprised-- DANE: Oh, hold on, we've got to turn the cassette over, sorry. This is the end of side one, Victor Tartarini, Interview Number 94. It's 4:00. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO DANE: This is the beginning of side two, Victor tartarini, Interview Number 94. It's 4:02. We were just talking about when you saw the black porter. TARTARINI: That's right. DANE: And it was a surprise for you. TARTARINI: It was a very big surprise till me father told me what it's all about, you know. And from there we went out, we took the train, Central, I forgot-- DANE: Grand central Station? TARTARINI: Grand Central Station. We took the train to Boston. And to me it was a dream to see the water, the train go over the water, like, you know, like a bridge, you know what I mean. Saw this tall building, it was the most beautiful sight in the world. Ad, well, I didn't tell you, though, when we saw the Statue of Liberty, did I? DANE: We talked a little bit. TARTARINI: Oh, yeah, we talked, we said, yeah, that we were so happy to see it. It was the most beautiful thing anybody could see because you talk so much about that, you know. DANE: Had people told you about the Statue of Liberty before? TARTARINI: Oh,yes. Well, I knew that, and the books, too, you know. You know, in the history books in Italy, you know. I read a little bit. You know, I was young, but still I read. Because my father was an American and I, I tried to read a lot about it. you know what I mean, so I wouldn't be so stupid with him. DANE: Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah. TARTARINI: So, anyway, anyway, we took the train, and we landed in South Station in Boston. Beautiful station, a big station. Not as big as New York, but it was a big station. And as we get out of there, we went to, uh, get a couple of sandwiches outside there someplace, a little restaurant. And afterwards we walked and we went under the subway to take the elevator to go in Everett. The elevator would just go to Everett. And don't you think I wasn't scared when the elevator was in the top of the sky. You know, you take the elevator from, you don't, I don't know if you know where's South Station, but he knows, it's all on top, you know. It's not in the road, you know, it's in top. And I was scared when I looked down and looked this way and looked that way, you know. And, uh-- DANE: Had you ever seen anything like that? TARTARINI: No. I never saw anything like that, dear. Well, it was, we were born in a little farm like a, we were poor people, we were , you know. You take Milan, it's beautiful city, and maybe you see everything. Bologna, big, but Finalemilia [PH] it's just a little dinky town, you know, like Wakefield to Boston, you know what I mean. So anyway, so we landed in Everett. And from Everett I got another thrill. We had to take a streetcar to Linden. I don't know if you remember the streetcars, but you must have saw a picture. The streetcar would go blub, blub, blub, blub, and my brother gets sick again, because the streetcar goes from one way to another way, and that's about from Boston to Linden, to Malden, that's twelve miles, see, there's twelve miles. Okay, before, when we reached Linden, where my father was living, he said to me, "Now, remember Victor, when you open that door, hug that woman and say, 'Hello, Mama.'" (Italian phrase) in Italian (Italian phrase). Went up to the door, he let us go in first. I banged the door. My father was smiling and laughing, and my uncle, too. This woman came, homely, ho! She was an Indian, like. An old Indian. That wasn't my mother. But I saw that woman, my father told me to hug the woman opened the door so I hugged here and give her a kiss, "Mama, Mama." And she said, "(Italian phrase.) Mama in the kitchen." Then my mother came, my stepmother came, she heard that, she came right over. She said, "(Italian phrase). Your Mama's right here." So i hugged her. Big woman. She weigh about two hundred and fifty pounds. And, okay, then we went in the house and she had a beautiful dinner for us, beautiful supper. Everything was ready. She knew when we were coming. I goes in the dining room I see apples, bananas. I never saw a banana in my life. I never saw a banana in my life. I saw orange once in a while for Christmas, they put in the stocking for Christmas present an orange, see. And when I saw bananas, I saw apples, I saw pear, oh, my God. parent
