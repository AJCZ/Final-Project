She said yes about the Statue of Liberty, that she realized she was there. And then she said she went with her husband's cousin for a few days. Can I insert something here? SIGRIST: Sure, sure. Absolutely. GOWETT: My father was already an American citizen. He lived in Mechanicville, in New York. SIGRIST: Was he born in this country? GOWETT: No, no. SIGRIST: He had emigrated from Italy. GOWETT: Yes, yes. And he lived, he had a family in Mechanicville. His wife died, and he had five children. And he took the five children, went back to Italy, and that's when they fixed him up, and my mother, see. SIGRIST: So he was a big older than your mother, perhaps? GOWETT: He was forty. SIGRIST: And, actually, your mother was not a young girl either in terms of marriage. GOWETT: Oh, that's right. She was an old maid. They considered her an old maid at twenty-eight. So then they courted. They fixed them up and they courted, and they came back and settled in Mechanicville. SIGRIST: Do you remember anything about Ellis Island? GOWETT: Ma, ( Italian ) a New York? ( Italian ) Do you remember that? Yeah, Ma, ( Italian ). It was ( Italian ). You remember? Huh? PARILLO: I don't remember nothing. GOWETT: You don't remember nothing.

GOWETT: ( Italian ) PARILLO: No more (?). GOWETT: She never saw them again. SIGRIST: When you got to America, did you write to your mother and father? GOWETT: ( Italian ) Yes, they wrote all the time. SIGRIST: Did any of your other relatives come to America? GOWETT: Mom, ( Italian ) PARILLO: Nah. GOWETT: Oh, ( Italian ). PARILLO: I don't remember. GOWETT: You don't remember. She has a brother and a sister, and they both came. SIGRIST: Before or after she did? GOWETT: This is what she just said she couldn't remember. Ma, it had to be after because she was the oldest. ( Italian ) Yeah, they came after. SIGRIST: Did you like America when you got here? GOWETT: Ma, ( Italian ) PARILLO: ( Italian ) GOWETT: ( Italian ) She always said she was grateful that we were here during the war, because she had three girls. SIGRIST: Why don't you . . . PARILLO: ( Italian ) GOWETT: No, Ma, no. SIGRIST: We can wrap this up, but let me ask you a few questions, Josie. Perhaps you could . . . PARILLO: Leave me alone. SIGRIST: In a minute, in a minute. Perhaps you could list the children yourself, and if you have any siblings, and when you were born, if you would do that, please. GOWETT: You mean my sisters. SIGRIST: Yes, exactly, and where you were born and when. GOWETT: Okay. I was born in, no, let me put it this way. The oldest sister was born in . . . PARILLO: I got to go in (?). GOWETT: All right, Mom. All right. ( Italian ) My sister Mary was born in Troy, New York, December 29, 1923. SIGRIST: So soon after they got here, actually, a year. GOWETT: Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, she got pregnant, became pregnant on the boat. That child died, and then she became pregnant for the oldest one, and she was born in '22. I take that back. And I was born in January 22nd, 1924. SIGRIST: Okay. And where were you born, in Troy, also? GOWETT: I was born in Mechanicville. See, that's all the same area. Then we have another. PARILLO: (?) GOWETT: Then we have another sister that was born May 24th in 1927, and she was born in New York City, in The Bronx. Then we moved. See, my father traveled. Then we moved to Ticonderoga and there was a boy born in Ticonderoga, but he's been dead. When was his birthday? It was September 22nd. PARILLO: (?) GOWETT: You know, I really can't. He was forty-five when he died. He died about ten years ago, so that would make him, what? PARILLO: Leave me alone. GOWETT: ( Italian ), Ma. SIGRIST: Well, this is a good time, then, I think. You know, I want to thank you for letting me come out, and for speaking with you, Mrs. Parillo. Thank you for your time. And this is Paul Sigrist signing off for the National Park Service in Ticonderoga, New York, with Maria Parillo.
