LEVINE: This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm here with Thomas Iaci, and it's September 2, 1992. And I'm in his home in Methuen, Massachusetts. And Mrs. Iaci, his wife, is here with us. And Mr. Iaci came from Italy in 1931 when he was thirteen years of age. So I'm happy that I'm able to talk with you today, and I'll be as brief as possible. Tell me where you were born. IACI: I was born in Villarosa, Sicily. LEVINE: And what year? What's your birth date? IACI: 1918, 1918, August the 1st. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Okay. And do you remember the village where you were born? IACI: Oh, very well. LEVINE: Could you tell me what you remember about it? What was it like? IACI: Well, I remember everything. LEVINE: What did people do there? IACI: Well, they used to work in the sulphur mines in the olden days, but now they did away with it. LEVINE: I see. And so most of the men worked in the sulphur mine? IACI: Most of them. A lot of people used to get killed there, too. LEVINE: What was it? Why was it so dangerous? IACI: You work under mine for about two, three hundred feet, whatever. Of course, I was smart. I (?) know how deep it would go. Something would make it cave in, and they'd get trapped in the mine. LEVINE: I see. Now, did people farm there? Did people have farms? IACI: Forms? What's that? LEVINE: Farms? Did they have farms? IACI: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. A lot of people had little farms, you know. For them it was like a million dollars, having a farm like that. LEVINE: What did you do for enjoyment when you were living in there? IACI: I used to play with, what do you call them, tops? I used to go bicycle riding. Kid stuff, you know. LEVINE: And do you, do you remember the house you lived in? IACI: Oh, yeah. When I went there in 1970, I looked at it. It reminded me of the olden days. But then I went in 1990, things change altogether. LEVINE: Oh, really. What do you remember about it? What was so old-fashioned about it? IACI: Well, to me, when I was a kid, it was not old-fashioned. Anybody that had a home there, that's something good. Because when we came from America, back there things were changed, it's different. LEVINE: Well, what did your father do in Sicily? IACI: Well, I don't remember what he did, because when I was a kid he was in America. LEVINE: Oh. He, you never knew him in Italy. Uh-huh. And what was your father's name? IACI: Joseph Iaci. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And your mother's name? IACI: Gaetana Chandra. Her maiden name, Chandra. LEVINE: Chandra. And your full name is what? IACI: My full name is Gaetano Iaci. LEVINE: And did you have grandparents in Sicily that you knew? IACI: No. LEVINE: No. And did you have, like, aunts and uncles and cousins? IACI: Yeah, sure, a lot of them. LEVINE: Yeah. Were you a religious family? IACI: Yes. We used to go to church on a Sunday every Sunday, most of the time. LEVINE: And what did the men in town do for, like for entertainment? IACI: Oh, when they out of work, to go to the piazza and they meet their friends. You talk to me, I talk to you. You buy me a glass of beer, stuff like that. Of course, there was no beer there, there was wine. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And how about your mother? Did she work at all? IACI: Nope, she never work. LEVINE: Did you have brothers and sisters? IACI: Yeah. LEVINE: And what were their names? IACI: Their names, Lucy Iaci, Pauline Iaci and James Iaci. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And did you go to school in Sicily? IACI: Second grade. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And then what did you do? IACI: Came to America. LEVINE: Oh. Okay. Now, how was it decided that you and your mother and your brothers and sisters would come here? IACI: My father sent for us. LEVINE: He sent money and a ticket, or . . . IACI: Uh-huh. But what happened, we went for a visa, and my mother didn't pass the visa, so my brothers had to come here alone, he was the older one, my brother, James. So he came 1930 to America, and they left me behind with my mother, to take care of my mother. Because my two sisters had died, so I stayed with my mother. 1931 my father came to Italy to pick us, the two of us. My mother didn't pass, and I passed, so we waited two more months, no, a month before for the next visa, so she didn't pass, so I come here with my father in 1931 to America. LEVINE: Why didn't your mother pass? ( an airplane is heard passing overhead ) IACI: Because she was too weak. LEVINE: What was it like to see your father, because you hadn't really known your father. IACI: Yeah, I know. We made friends. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: Yeah? What kind of a man was he? How would you talk about him? IACI: Well, pretty good. LEVINE: How did he treat you? IACI: Well, he wasn't the best father. LEVINE: He wasn't. IACI: No. LEVINE: No. Was he strict? IACI: Very. LEVINE: So you and your father came together to the United States. And what was that trip like? Do you remember leaving the village? IACI: Oh, yeah. We left from Palermo. LEVINE: Were you happy to be coming to America, or were you sad to leave? IACI: ( he pauses ) I was sad, I wasn't happy. LEVINE: Yeah. Okay. Well, was the trip difficult, the voyage? IACI: I was unhappy to leave my mother behind. ( he is moved ) LEVINE: Yeah, yeah, I bet. Yeah. And, but you were excited about coming to America because it was an adventure, I guess. Well, then, did you, how did you get to the boat? IACI: From Palermo. We took the boat, the name of the boat was Providence. LEVINE: Oh, uh-huh. IACI: I still remember. LEVINE: Yeah, good. So what was the voyage like on the Providence? IACI: Oh, we stopped all kinds of, we stopped about fifteen stops, Algeria, Providence, all the states. LEVINE: You mean, once you got to the United States? IACI: It took us fourteen days to get here. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Do you remember coming, were you down in the bottom of the ship? Were you with what they call steerage? IACI: No. LEVINE: No? Did you have a cabin? IACI: Oh, sure. LEVINE: So did you have a comfortable voyage? IACI: Yeah. We had, like, bunk beds. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Were there other people in your cabin besides you and your father? IACI: Just me and my father. LEVINE: And do you remember coming into the New York Harbor? IACI: Very well. LEVINE: What do you remember? IACI: I remember Ellis Island. LEVINE: Do you remember the Statue of Liberty? IACI: Uh-huh. We must have got in about five, six o'clock in the morning. There was the Statue of Liberty. My father said, "Look, look, look." LEVINE: Did it mean anything to you at that age? IACI: It was something beautiful, beautiful. LEVINE: Then you got to Ellis Island, and what do you remember? What did it strike you as? IACI: We had to go through a visa. They made us strip. Of course, my father says, once he was separated off from me. And Ellis Island wasn't the way it is now. It looked like a barn. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: That's what it was like for you? IACI: So I had to go through a visa and so we, I got on the boat again, and then a few minutes, (?). It was like 34th Street or 42nd Street. You know, all the piers of New York. One of those places. We got off, and then my father's friend come up to pick us up in a little chug-chug, a 1931 Ford. LEVINE: You never saw a car before? IACI: Oh, yeah. LEVINE: You had seen cars. IACI: Then we go over a bridge. It don't know if it was the Brooklyn Bridge or what bridge it was. Look, look, look, looking down. I'm looking down. Ha. I remember all that. LEVINE: And then where did you go? IACI: To my father's house. LEVINE: Where? IACI: New York. LEVINE: Oh. Where was it in New York? Do you remember? IACI: Uh, Market Street. LEVINE: Market Street? IACI: Market. LEVINE: Huh. Did you, was it like a tenement apartment, or . . . IACI: It was a tenement, yeah. LEVINE: Yeah, uh-huh. Was it in Brooklyn, or . . . IACI: No, no, in New York City. LEVINE: In New York City. And what do you remember about that place? IACI: Oh, I remember the lights you got to pull with a chain, the bathroom, same thing. ( he laughs ) LEVINE: And what was your father doing for work when he was in New York? IACI: He had a candy store before he came to Italy. Then he sell to his brother-in-law. But actually didn't do too much. LEVINE: When he got back, you mean? When you came back with him. IACI: It was the Depression. Nobody was working then. LEVINE: All right. Okay. IACI: Nobody was working. LEVINE: Uh-huh. So what did you do once you got to New York? IACI: I shined shoes. LEVINE: Uh-huh. IACI: My father didn't want me to go to shine shoes, but I want to go shine shoes. So I made my own little box, and I went shined shoes. With this I learned the language. LEVINE: So then did you stay shining shoes for a long time? Of, what did you do after that? IACI: A couple of years. LEVINE: What did you do after that? IACI: A couple years. Then we used to make like a buck-and-a-half, two dollars. We used to eat. The Depression, everything was cheap. A loaf of bread, five cents, yeah. ( he pauses ) Then I want to stop shining shoes, my father won't let me. I said, "Pa, let me keep the shine shoe box. When you wnat a shine, I'll shine yours." I didn't want to shine more. Fifteen, sixteen, start to grow up like looking at the girls, you know. ( he laughs ) I said, "Pa, here I'm gonna break the box." "You don't break no box, I'll break your back." He did. I broke the box, and he broke my back. And I took off. LEVINE: On a truck? Did you go to work on the truck? IACI: I went to see my brother, he give me, I used to work for Dennis & Kennedy, a trucking company. Dennis & Kennedy. I got a job over there, helper, truckers, oh, fifteen, sixteen years old, truck driver's helper, working night time from six to three in the morning, whenever we all done with that stuff, and I'd be sleeping on top of the truck. LEVINE: So then did you live with your brother? IACI: My brother, no. LEVINE: No. You stayed living with your father? IACI: My brother came over here to Massachusetts. Then I decided to come over here. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And were you still working with your brother? IACI: No. LEVINE: No. Did your father come up here to Massachusetts, too? IACI: After a while, after a while I went to service. I become a citizen, and this and that. The first money I made, I sent for my mother. I got married, I sent for my mother and she came over here to me. LEVINE: That must have been nice. IACI: That's the best money . . . LEVINE: You ever spent. IACI: In my life. LEVINE: So it was really nice to see your mother again. Yeah. Uh-huh. How did you meet your wife? IACI: When the bus stopped, she was coming out, you know, with other people. So my brother knew her through his wife. We started talking to her, before you know it (?) we got together. LEVINE: So did you court your wife for a long time, or you got married right away, or what? IACI: ( he coughs ) The best woman I ever, the best woman I ever married. LEVINE: The best woman you ever married, huh? ( she laughs ) Good, good. Do you have children? IACI: Three. LEVINE: Well, first tell me your wife's name. IACI: Constance Iaci. LEVINE: And the maiden name? IACI: Grasso. LEVINE: Grasso. And your children's names? IACI: Joseph Iaci, Lorraine Iaci and Dennis Iaci. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And do you have grandchildren? IACI: Seven. LEVINE: Good. Any "great?" IACI: Not yet. LEVINE: Seven grandchildren. IACI: My oldest grandchild started yesterday going for college. LEVINE: Oh, wow. Well, what are you most proud of that you've done in your life? What makes you proud? IACI: What I am, and what I achieved. LEVINE: What did you do for work after you came here? IACI: I worked on, everywhere. Carpentry, masonry, plastering. I built this here, see this here? I built. And barber. LEVINE: And barber. And shoes? IACI: Huh? LEVINE: What about shoes? Did you . . . IACI: I'm not a shoemaker. LEVINE: ( prompted by Mrs. Iachi ) Shoe shop? IACI: Oh, a shoe shop? No, not that much. Oh, General Tire. I worked for General Tire. That's where I caught the cancer. ( a dog barks ) LEVINE: Really. IACI: Of course, we could've catch it anywhere, really. LEVINE: Uh, let's see. Well, did you or your brother or your father, were there certain things that you kept up that were ways that people had in Italy after you came to the United States? Were there any ways that you just kept that were Italian ways of doing things? IACI: Oh, I don't know, I don't know. ( an airplane can be heard in the background on the tape ) We ate the same spaghetti sauce in the old country. Italian food, you know, stuff like that. Ice cream was new to us. I worked for a lot of things. I'm just say the top part. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Okay. Well, are you glad you came to this country? IACI: Very, very glad. LEVINE: Why are you glad? IACI: Because, the land of opportunity. LEVINE: You think you had more opportunity here than if you had stayed. IACI: Oh, sure. Actually, I got a lot more to say, but I don't know if I should. LEVINE: Uh, well, if you want to, and then if you hear the tape you could take, you could take it out if you want to. IACI: My voice is not the same, so. LEVINE: Would you want, do you want to think about whether you want to say some other things? IACI: Something about my father, bad. Want me to tell you? ( he laughs ) LEVINE: If you want to. It's up to you. IACI: Well, I'll tell you. When I was about seventeen years old, or sixteen, I was in a theater, me and three kids, my friends. We were watching TV, you know, kids have fun. Eating peanuts. So what happened? All of a sudden a detective comes up, and he grabbed me. "What did I do?" "Come on." Me, I'm a scared kid. They take me to the police station. My father didn't come over to find out what's wrong. So they have to take me different place. Finally my father comes. "What's the matter?" "What's the matter?" "I didn't do nothing, I got arrested." "You didn't do nothing." Because he had a sweetheart. My father had a sweetheart, so my mother come, that's why I don't want to say. So finally I says to my father, "Pa, go and see Alfredo, two other kids, and tell them to be a witness that we didn't do nothing." He didn't do that! (?) So I got put away to Manapak, New York Institute. Two years, I did. He didn't even write me a letter, nothing. So there was a friend of mine that used to work for marionettes. Good people, nice people. They were looking for me all over. My father didn't even tell them that I was in prison. So finally my friends found out, and I used to chum around with his son. The kid died in 1938, I got papers, in 1938, was killed, was looking for me. ( he is moved ) LEVINE: Wow. IACI: I'm very emotional. LEVINE: Yes. Did you ever, did you, were you ever found to be innocent? IACI: How could I? So then my brother found out. This man put in papers to get me out. Instead of my brother, come over, and he took over. So this guy, the old man, Montero, says to me, "Tommy, there's Johnny's bed for you." Long story, treated like a son. (?) So I said, "Mr. Montero, I appreciate it very much." I called my brother. "Oh, yeah, sure, sure." So I went with my brother, and that's why I'm over here. LEVINE: Did you ever regret that decision? Are you sorry you made that decision? IACI: No. LEVINE: No. IACI: I met my wife. LEVINE: Do you know why you chose the way you did? Why did you choose to go with your brother? IACI: My family. LEVINE: Your family, uh-huh. IACI: I got along with my brother beautiful. Never argued, never . . . LEVINE: Yeah. So how did, how did you know this man, Mr. Montero? IACI: When he came from Italy, I told you, he had four sons. One son was a little younger than me, maybe a year. This guy got into a liking to me. LEVINE: I see. IACI: So he showed me how to rollerskate. We used to go out, we were always together like two peas in a pod. LEVINE: Yeah. Uh-huh. IACI: And we used to do a lot of things together. LEVINE: Well, it sounds like you always had a lot of good friends. IACI: Oh, yeah. LEVINE: Did you ever make your peace with your father? IACI: Oh, yeah. When I got married. Me, I'm easy going. LEVINE: I'm sorry, say it again? IACI: Me, I'm an easy going. When I got married, I went for my honeymoon (?) I went to New York, and the first thing, I went down to see my father. He wasn't home. So we were so tired, so I says to my wife, says my aunt, I said, "Aunt, my wife's tired. I'm going to look for my father." "Yeah, yeah, yeah." She was out. She was tired. So from, after a while we got a hold of my father. And like if nothing happened. I still treat him as a father. LEVINE: Well, You must have a big heart. IACI: Yeah. Only once I gave my father hell, once. LEVINE: What did you give him hell about? IACI: Well, me and my brother went to New York for, to see my mother and father, no? So what happens? He was invited to one of his friend's for dinner, Sunday dinner. So we went down, I saw him, introduce him, I was grown up, no more kids. So, tweleve o'clock, so we were going to eat, you know. My father, "Don't worry about it." I said, "We're going up to Servina." He was in the (?). So, "Ah, we're going to go, don't worry about it." So he says to my brother, "Let's go to Servina." We went to Servina, so she's making coffee, and we're almost about have coffee, the phone rang. ( he imitates ringing phone ) I says to Servina, "Servina," I says, "Servina, if it's my father, if it's my father, tell him we're not here." "Servina, my son's here?" No? "They're having coffee." So, you should come over and sit down and eat at twelve o'clock. Okay, okay, bye. I knew it was twelve o'clock over there, because when I give my word to be there, I'll be there! So I go back, and my father said, "(?)." He says, "Where'd yous go?" "Out." "Did you go to Servina?" "And if I did what about it?" "For Christ's sake, you never changed." "You've been crooked, and you've very crooked, and anytime." So. LEVINE: Yeah. IACI: So my mother says, "Thomas," in Italian. My name is Thomas in Italian. "Thomas . . ." "Ah, shut up, you too," to my mother. So everybody kept quiet through dinner. That's the only time I get a little blasted. But as far as mother was concerned, I said, "You know my father." LEVINE: Yeah. IACI: And then . . . ( break in tape ) LEVINE: Okay. We're resuming now. I want to ask you, how were you as a father with your sons? You have one son? IACI: I have two sons. LEVINE: Two sons. Okay. Do you think, how were you like your father or different from your father with your own sons? IACI: No comparison. LEVINE: How were you different? IACI: Well, I'm an easygoing. If something's wrong, I let them know about it. You know what I mean? I cut things right in the middle. If you're right, you're right. If you're wrong, you're wrong. LEVINE: And how was your father with you? IACI: ( he laughs ) Right or wrong, he's right. LEVINE: I see. So you were fair-minded with your . . . IACI: All the time. LEVINE: Uh-huh. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO IACI: Every one of my kids had a car from me. I gave them a car when they first started, my daughter, thank God, now they're doing all right. LEVINE: Good. So that's another thing to be proud of, that you were a good father to your children. IACI: I told my sons, they brag about me so much. LEVINE: That's wonderful. Okay. Well . . . IACI: They say, "I got the best father in the world." LEVINE: Great. IACI: I say, "That's your say so." ( they laugh ) LEVINE: Well, now, is there anything, before we close, anything else you'd like to say about being born in Italy, coming to this country, life here, and anything else you'd like to mention? IACI: Life in this country, is the best country in the world. I don't care who knows, that's my, my expression. I love this country. LEVINE: You've gone back to Italy a couple of times. IACI: Yeah, in 1990 and 1970. The first time I went with my wife, and she doesn't like, I don't know why. LEVINE: Yeah. IACI: So, if I was feeling good, I would have went again. My cousins used to come back. LEVINE: So you still love Italy as much as you love America. IACI: I like for past time, you know, vacation. Because if I didn't have her with me, I would have spend six months of the winter there, and six months of the summer here, so borrow a couple hundred dollars for the trip. But I just got beautiful, beautiful. I got a good place over here, too. But it's (?). LEVINE: Okay. Well, I think maybe this is a good place to stop, and I want to thank you very much for talking with me. And this is Janet Levine. I'm been talking with Tom Iachi, and I'm here in Methuen, Massachusetts on September 2, 1992, and I'm signing off.
