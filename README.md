### Project Description
#####Background
Since 1973, the Ellis Island Oral History project has been dedicated to preserving the first-hand recollections
of immigrants who passed through the Ellis Island immigration station between 1892 and 1954 and the employees
who worked there.

Over the years, the project has grown to include approximately 1900 interviews. The interviews include people
from dozens of countries, former Immigration and Public Health Service employees, military personnel stationed
at Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty as well as people detained at Ellis Island during World War II until
it closed in 1954.

Each person interviewed receives a tape of the interview which describes their daily life in the country of
origin, family history, reasons for emigration, journey to New York arrival and processing at Ellis Island and
the immigrants' adjustment to life in the United States.

The Ellis Island Oral History interviews are available to researchers and interested members of the public in
the Oral History Library, located on the third floor of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. People wishing to
use the complete interviews, both as recordings or on-screen transcripts may do so by using the specially
designed computer stations in this room.

Simple instructions found on the computer screen assist the user with locating any desired interviews and
pertinent information. These computers contain the oral history interviews only and do not contain general
immigration records such as ship manifests, passports etc.

Each interview includes an examination of everyday life in the country of origin, family history, reasons for
coming to the United States, the journey to the existing port, experiences or the ship, arrival and processing
at the Ellis Island facility and an in-depth look at the adjustment to living in the United States.
Approximately fifteen interviews are added yearly by full time and volunteer staff members.
