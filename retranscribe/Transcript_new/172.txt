do you think the fact that you started out for 20 years and lived in sweden and then you came here? do you think the fact that you changed countries as a young woman, do you think that made a difference on the rest of your life? borgesen: 		no, i don’t' think so. janet: 	is there anything else you can think of that has to do with the fact of coming here from sweden and living out your life here? borgesen: 	well, if i wasn't going to bring the boy over, i don't think i would be here [laughter]. janet: 	really? borgesen: 		hmmm. janet: 	so that was kind of an accident that happened that way. what do you think would be different if you had stayed in sweden as compared with coming here? we just stop.  an interruption, we're really just sort of winding up but the fact that you had to start a whole new life at 20 years of age that must make you somehow- it’s kind of different than most people who start out some place and live their whole life that way.  so do you remember when it became clear to you that you liked it here and you wanted to stay here? was there any time that that happened? borgesen: 		yeah, i liked it very much here. janet: 	did you like it right at the beginning or did you [crosstalk 00:31:30]? borgesen: 	you know you don't like everything the first but you like the [unclear 00:31:35]. janet: 	did you learn english easily? how was that for you, learning english? borgesen: 		well, it’s hard for everybody to learn english i think. janet: 	did those night classes make a big difference? borgesen: 		oh yes. janet: 	and how about citizenship? did you try for citizenship and the papers? borgesen: 		hmmm. janet: 	did you take an exam? borgesen: 		oh yeah, they asked you about 15 questions. janet: 	you were okay [unclear 00:32:15] [laughter]? okay, alright well if there's anything else you can remember? can you remember anything else about sweden or anything else you want to say before we close? borgesen: 	when we were born, my twin sister and i. my sister went to school and she stopped at the next house and the woman said, "did your mother have a baby?" "yeah, she had two." "then i can have one," she said, "you can have both of them [laughter]. janet: 	this was your sister? borgesen: 		yeah [laughter]. janet: 	oh that’s funny. borgesen: 		of course she had to baby sit so she was [laughter]. janet: 	how did your sister martha- how was her life different from yours? borgesen: 		well, i don't know really, see we didn't have the same interests. janet: 	but she came to this country too? borgesen: 	no, just for visit. no she was [unclear 00:33:25] most of the time but she got married and her husband and they were here very few times because she had a daughter in california. janet: 	do you think your life would have been different if you had stayed in sweden? how would it have been different? borgesen: 	i don't know, now they have it very good but that time it wasn't so good. no, i'm satisfied here. janet: 	well, it’s been a pleasure talking with you. borgesen: 		same here [laughter]. janet: 	thank you very much and i want to say i'm speaking with ida borgesen who came from sweden in 1923 when she was 20 years and today she's 92 and we're here in newton on july, 15th, 1995 and this is janet levine for the national park service signing off.
