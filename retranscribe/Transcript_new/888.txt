kirschen: 	well they didn’t want to go back to poland and they didn’t want to remain in vienna. and we had some relatives here who helped us come. janet: 	so when your father was here what was he doing this country? kirschen: 	he was a cashier at a center business at a bakery at the six and the lance street. janet: 	so was he able to send money for you and your mother and your brother? kirschen: 	that’s where by-that’s how my mother was able to live that my father did support us. janet: 	and during the war years-no in the war years he was in the army right it was after- kirschen:	 he was in the army until he went to the united states. that was 22-23 i imagine. janet: 	and did he come to this country alone? kirschen: 	yes janet: 	and he had relatives? kirschen: 	my mother had relatives and they helped him come. they gave him an affidavit and whatever else it took. janet: 	so then he must have to learn english kirschen: 	yes in a way he did janet: 	and then became citizen and the plan was he would become a citizen and then you would come over?

kirschen: 	yes i do janet: 	what do you remember about that? kirschen:	 i remember because my younger brother was examined very thoroughly by the physicians. janet: 	why was that? kirschen: 	well he was little. he was about 10 years younger than i am. and my mother knew all the information so she was helpful. she was bright woman. janet: 	were your brother suspected of having some kind of medical condition? kirschen: 	no not suspected. he was smaller than i am. you know he was six or seven years old when he came here. so his development was kind of slow. janet: 	do you remember what you or your mother felt about have been examined at ellis island. kirschen: 	well i don’t remember anything. my mother was the source of information for the american officers who took care of us and brought us to the apartment that my dad had rented for us on the [unclear 00:26:00] and lance streets. i still remember the apartment. janet: 	really? kirschen: 	yes. janet:	 do you want to describe it? kirschen: 	well it was an apartment on the first floor of a tenement building. and it was across the street from a public school to which my brother went. i went to indie high school at the time. it was-it’s now known as suadpark high school. but i worked during the day and went to school at night. janet: 	why was it that the american officers-they brought you from ellis island to your father's apartment? kirschen: 	no my father took a taxi cab. south ferry to the east side which was far. but i do remember we went up to the 3rd avenue elevator all the way to the lance street. janet:	wait how did that strike you and elevator train? kirschen:	 i don’t-i have no memories of it. i used it later on. janet: 	how do you mean? kirschen: 	i used it because i worked for my uncle who was actually-my mother's cousin's husband. and i got a job there. janet: 	what kind of work was his doing-? kirschen: 	stationary store. a wholesale stationary store. and i was star clerk janet: 	and that was your first job? kirschen: 	that was my first job yes. janet: 	and then you were going to night school- kirschen: 	and while i worked there i went to night school. and i went to indie high school and learned english there. janet: 	was the high school specifically to teach english or was teaching other subjects. kirschen: 	no, no. it was teaching other subjects. i was best in german. janet: 	how was it for you to learn yet again another language? kirschen: 	well i don’t remember learning german originally. but it no problem it was just the language that we spoke at home. janet: 	german? kirschen:	 german. janet: 	oh you did. kirschen: 	german and yiddish. janet: 	oh i see and you were also very young when you moved into vienna so you learned it probably very easily. and then coming here as young man or teenager. kirschen:	 well the store that i worked in the language was english but most of it was yiddish. and i sort of learned more of it while i was there. it was good experience. janet: 	so how long did you stay in high school and then what did you do for your next job after you worked for your uncle? kirschen: 	that was the only job i had. because from there i went to city college [unclear 00:30:19] and i learned german a little better. janet: 	at city college? kirschen: 	of course yes. and i graduated from city college and i did not want to go back to work in the stationary store. -excuse me can i help you with anything piece of fruit? janet: 	let me just stop-pause you here for second. okay we are resuming now. let’s see you were talking about you went to city college you didn’t want to go back to work in you uncle's stationary store. kirschen:	 upon graduation i took some courses at the new school. in economics. and i-we had a friend who was in the professional section of the us employment service. and she referred me to kings point where i became a teacher and i was there for 35 years. janet: 	so that was your like work in the [unclear 00:32:00] teaching economics at kings point? kirschen:	 economics, marine insurance and i learned the shipping business there too. janet: 	and just to go back a little bit when you first came to this country were there things that struck you were very different that you recall? kirschen:	 well i learned everything here. janet: 	you mean what you did for your carrier in it- kirschen: 	that’s right. but i learned about business i learned there. it went a very well it wasn’t a formal education you see because this was a whole sale stationary and toy store that supplied candy stores at the time.  janet: 	so you learned that doing it? kirschen:	 i learned that on the job yes. janet: 	and then your formal education [unclear 00:33:25] kirschen: 	my formal education helped. janet:	 can you describe anything about the lower east side when you and your family first came to live here. kirschen: 	well it was really very different than it is today? kirschen: 	how so?  kirschen: 	well at the time that we came here i only knew jewish people. jewish families. it’s different entirely different now. your immigration of porturicans and italians and various other groups came in and mixed with our group. and i never earned any spanish [laughter] i wish i did.  janet: 	when you were there it was mostly jewish? kirschen: 	yes janet: 	were there social clubs that you and your family- kirschen:	 i did me came to one. benta hacoa janet: 	could you spell it? kirschen: 	hecoa-its a-it’s really a hebrew word for the soccer team that was jewish in vienna. there was one jewish team. and my uncle he used to take me to that because that was the team that we supported. and they supported. and therefore i supported it. but it was very interesting. they-my uncles moved to israel in 1921-22 something like that.  janet:	 from vienna? kirschen:	 from vienna. and two of them became physicians and the thirst one was an engineer and he became a farmer. janet: 	so the social club in the lower east side had the same name as the soccer team - kirschen:	 it was named for the soccer team janet: 	did you’re interested in soccer carry over because this country is not so soccer oriented. kirschen: 	while i played. i played on the city college team which was kind of difficult for me because i hadn’t played in a long time. i am trying to think of interesting things.  janet: 	you are doing wonderfully so whatever. but maybe something about that social club what was that like when you first came here. kirschen: 	it was mostly refugees or immigrants jewish and on sunday night we had on the [unclear 00:37:37] a place where we met. we talked about vienna and about new york and things of that sort. janet: 	where there any differences as you can recall about being a refugee in vienna and being an immigrant in new york? kirschen: 	oh i was much younger. vienna. and here i was an adult i was a college graduate. one of the few at the club. what else can i tell you that were different? well hacoa to me it’s actually-i pass by their frequently on the bus and i always look what’s doing. and in the basement at the street level there was a jewish restaurant. and it was interesting.  janet:	 i imagine there were a lot of jewish restaurant and synagogues in the lower east side that are not there now. kirschen: 	lower east side. ohh yes. because the lower east side where i lived i lived on the corner of orchard and rivington streets. and most of the people who lived there now are recent immigrants. can i help you? with anything? janet: 	well let’s stop for a moment now. we are resuming now. we were talking about the lower east side and the changes. kirschen: 	the changes are drastic. most of the people in that area are latin american immigrants. and there english is not good. we used to have push carts on orchy street. they are not there anymore. janet: 	when you came into this country and settled in lower east side how did you compare it in your mind to where you were in vienna? kirschen: 	well in vienna i was a student. and here i worked and was a student you see so it was much different. janet: 	did you prefer one to the other for any reason? kirschen:	 i prefer being in the united states because the opportunities look good. that was the only preference i am aware of during that period of time. janet: 	so did you marry at all? kirschen: 	yes i lost my wife 4-5 years ago. janet: 	what was her name? kirschen: 	her name was-let me show you a picture. hold on oh i see now i will not go far. this is my family janet:	 we are going to pause here a minute. [silence] okay we are continuing now after looking at some picture of your lovely family. i was asking you your wife's name? kirschen: 	its embarrassing [laughter] janet: 	that’s okay we are resuming now. you were saying your wife's maiden name was?  kirschen:  	niter peg janet: 	could you spell it please? kirschen: 	nitenperg  janet:	 and her first name? kirschen: 	i bet it-let me look at the pictures janet: 	well did you say it was fugal? kirschen: 	fagal was in yiddish. the yiddish name. janet: 	that’s good enough you wanted to- kirschen:	 i wanted to give you the english name. janet: 	okay us going to stop for a moment. so fagal was the yiddish name and her english name? kirschen: 	florence. janet: 	florence. and your children's names? kirschen: 	michael is an attorney and my daughter is nina. she is a social worker in [unclear 00:43:54] michigan. janet:	 i see and you have grandchildren? kirschen:	 i have two and two. and they are good kids.  janet: 	let’s see were talking about-well looking back at your life what makes you feel very proud? kirschen: 	well i became a professor. and i was a professor of economics and related subjects at the [unclear 00:44:30] academy for 35 years. janet 	and do you think having started your life in europe first in poland and then in austria, do you think that affected or how do you think that affected the rest of your life being here in america? kirschen:	 well i always have memories of my life in vienna. janet: 	do you think that cultured your life here in any way? the fact that you didn’t start out- kirschen:	 no. america offered me opportunities which i was smart enough to take advantage of. that’s all. janet: 	how about your mother and father how did they feel about coming here after they lived there a while? kirschen:	 oh they were delighted to come here. my father was an expert on clover seeds. clover seeds. which he was able to tell if he had some in his hand. janet:	 are you saying clover seeds? kirschen: 	clover janet: 	yeah. because he became a farmer? kirschen: 	no, no. my father became a counter man in- janet: 	oh he continued working- in a bakery. kirschen: 	he continued in a bakery. he was counter man. my mother went to indie high school with me. and she did better than i did.  janet: 	can you think of any dreams that you had as a young man that you realized or didn’t realize? any dreams of your own in your life? kirschen: 	no. i have achieved what i hoped for in the united states. and it was good to me. i retired from the [unclear 00:46:59] academy where i wore a uniform and saluting and everything. for 35 years. and i have a pension on which i live now. janet: 	how is this period of your life for you? kirschen:	 this period? janet: 	this period of being retired and- kirschen: 	well it’s kind of dull because i miss my wife. but she passed away as a result of some surgery which she had. and mu children were here and we let her go. because we didn’t want her to be disabled. and anything that they would have been able to do would have left her partially disabled which we couldn’t see.  janet:	 do you think you had any heroes in your life either public figures or private individuals- kirschen: 	my heroes are my uncles who went to israel. and helped to build israel as it is today. and- janet:	is there anything else you would like to sit before we close? about coming to this country or living your life in this country? kirschen: 	well coming to this country was an experience which i didn’t anticipate but it was all good. and with my mother help i was able to achieve to go to college and to university later on. new school. and i stayed at my job for 35 years. where i had a very good reputation. and i think you ought to be aware. i am teaching english to russian immigrants now. from [unclear 00:50:11]. my father in law was one of the founders of [unclear 00:50:28 workman circle] and i am active in it. i am involved in it. janet: 	what is your motivation for doing that work?
