stocz:	because they can’t afford more. kate:	i know but why those two days? why not monday and wednesday? why sunday and thursday? stocz:	they had a habit, middle delicacy; twice you had meat, pork and chicken. you sell the calf. nothing go wrong, the people grow up with that system and you have to watch everything. nothing spoil, nothing throw it away like here in the united states. i told that and the owner throw me in a jail. five cops questioned me back and forth. kate:	when did five cops question you? stocz:	when i was in europe in 1963. they wanted to know- first thing they asked me why united states people hogged on and [unclear 00:27:33] and die. there was because we no had enough to eat. that’s the reason people die like flies in the united states. i said i don’t want to get in trouble explain it. i said not because we no have enough to eat, we overeat in the united states.   day in day out american people they take to me [unclear 00:28:22] they don’t know. they no get used to it like in europe they make from the flour. noodles unlike here, lot of people don’t even know what noodle is, and the big onions. i still like onions especially in the summer. kate:	we go back to your house; so far you’ve told me you had your mother, your father, your grandmother, where are the kids in this back in hungary? how many children were living in that house? stocz:	i was alone. my brother come in the united states and anne take care of him. when he was old enough then he start to work. kate:	when you were little, your brother lived in the house, didn’t he? stocz:	yes. kate:	who else lived? you and your brother and any other children? stocz:	no, no children. stepmother and father and grandma.  the buildings in long way like i said. they call it an attic. you carry your crop up, whatever you had from the farm, and dump it on the second floor. kate:	what about the furniture? do you remember the furniture of your house? stocz:	yes, forget about it. kate:	was it home made? did you make your own furniture or did you buy it? stocz:	buy it. people get trained to make furniture then you ordered what kind you want hard wood or the soft. kate:	why do i have to forget about your furniture? stocz:	in europe, farm places, like when i come out in this country, we had no rag on the floor in 1920. the outside toilet was here too when i come out, a lot of places. kate:	you mean here in the united states they had outside toilets? stocz:	yes. we had no front room, we had no that large [inaudible 00:31:18] since i’m here. the united states [unclear 00:31:29] the working class people. dad used to say, “you know how much i make an hour? 10 cents or 9 cents an hour.” i start to work at 36 cents an hour.   year pass by and the union come in and when the union come in, more money you had only if you take care of it like i did in [unclear 00:32:07]. all three go to learn in college, two teachers and one was doing business administration in parker electric. he was superintendent, all three boys. kate:	we’re still back in hungary yet, but was there anyone in your family you were real close to? who was the closest person to you in your family? stocz:	father. i can’t say mom because i was a baby. i don’t remember her at all. she was a blonde. i was a blonde too, real blonde. now i get white. kate:	what about religious life at home? stocz:	hard work; when you’re about eight, nine years old they take you out on a farm. you work like a grow up. you no complain. they can’t understand to complain there; you’re young. you sleep. tomorrow you’re fresh like a daisy. that’s true when you’re young. no matter how hard you work so long they no take you out on a farm, you take care of the chicken and goose and whatever you have. you feed them, give them water.  they re-model it when i go home where i born and raise, they overhang like a pouch along the houses along the outside wall in one room or in another room, on the stable on the end. i grow up. i was 10 year old, put me in a stable to sleep.  in the winter time it was good because the animals they are nice and warm. you no smell nothing. you get used to it. if american children are put in a plane, i say this, if american children go home at good education for them and look around how the people struggle with daily life.  in europe never find piece of bread on the floor. if you do that when you’re small, they tell you, “i no want to see that no more.” if you do that, that’s a sin and you grow up with that. kate:	what was mealtime like? how many meals a day did you eat together? how did you eat your meal? stocz:	in morning the most people; father and son, mother and daughter, grow up daughter 13, 14 year. she worked like a grow up. kate:	whose daughter? stocz:	the family’s daughter. kate:	you didn’t have a daughter in your family, no. did you eat breakfast with your family? stocz:	yes. lot of time we had before you go out on the farm, especially when daddy when i grow up he was 52 year old. in europe the people no live to 90. if a person, very small person but majority of the people die out at 60 and the 60 the old man.   through the summer you always on the sun. you go early in the morning, sun the earlier it break. you make sure you’re on a farm on your own start to work. when the sun go down, so long you are able to see, you work. the sun go down, start get dark then you go home. mother go before you go home, prepare the meal. kate:	what was meal like? stocz:	noodles and milk; all kinds of noodles. they roll the dough with their hand and sometimes they grind the dough up then they cut it like over here in a stove. on the bigger where you fry on a pan to about an inch wide and you cook it, drain the water off, and the water drained off and they dump it in a frying pan. put some oil; most people cook with oil. it was a lot. then you prepare it, and it’s ready you ate the supper.   little soup, all kinds of soup in europe. they make their own bread. the loaf is about this round and five, six loaves. you had your [unclear 00:39:52] bread. that time i used to have toast. it was my favorite. dad used to say how big the loaf was i carried around, then cut into half, then got a plate on a stove. they build that part on a brick and on top they had two plates with the fire burning the meat.  they used to put bread on and then the toast ready, then get the butter and garlic. in europe people like putting garlic, rub the garlic on the bread, put the butter on. i still love it; i no deny that.  in united states it said you stink. i’ll be honest about it, lot of time i go out to work, “steve, why you eat garlic? you smell.” never mind, it’s healthy for me. the doctor even tell you more garlic you eat, better you feel. and onions; you grow up on onions and bread in europe. you can pick this or that, what they give you. you eat it or else they take it away, the next day you have to eat it. kate:	what about your church life there?

stocz:	dad gave me an idea. i see the writing on the wall; no future. he’s home. i like to go to my brothers in the united states and i never was afraid when we were kids. when i mentioned it, “dad i want to go to my brother in united states.” “sit down, son. i’m going to explain it to you. don’t think for a second they had rake, about six foot wide in europe. don’t think you’re going to hold that rake in your hand and rake the dollars to get. you have to work for it first”.  every day is pay day in his days, in 1900, 9 to 10 cents an hour so it’s hard work. every day you never know tomorrow you got a job whether or not the foreman come out and grab your arm in a [unclear 01:04:37], pick how many he need and give them a job and the rest an hour job.” he said, “you no allowed to hit a child. if you do, they throw you into jail.” kate:	who told you this? stocz:	my father. kate:	if you hit a child you go to jail. stocz:	yes. he said it’s a hard life; it’s not so easy like you think. i said, “dad, you never complain. i’m a hard worker, i’m a farmer. what able to do i do it. you know me.” “yes,” he said, “you’re right in that, and keep it up. if you reach there take care of your own job.” that’s 1900 long time the united states modernized. more and more jobs and re-model things. more wages and so forth. when i come out i started with 36 cents an hour and pay the $550 out and had a tailor-made suit, and had $60 in the bank. kate:	first year? stocz:	in a year, first year. kate:	what happened after that? you sat down, you spoke with your father and then you had to prepare to go to the states. once you got the money from your uncles what did you do? what did you pack? what did you take with you when you came? stocz:	from europe? a bag, the trunk fall apart; paper trunk. i buy a little bag, put my little ownings in.        kate:	like what? what did you take? stocz:	shirt, pants, socks, because i tapped the socks out cut from the wear out shirt, and you had cloth on your feet, and boots. boots fall apart and before i go on a ship i bought shoes in europe. i come with the shoes and pants and i never forget it either… dad cut a piece of bacon and smoked sausage. “if you reach out, give it your brother if you can”. never can tell how you’ll get hungry so i keep my word i said, “don’t worry dad, i keep it.” that was from europe. kate:	did you have anything else special? did you bring anything, pictures? stocz:	no. first when i come out i had my greenhorn picture. i know i got it; where i keep it that i don’t know, in the trunk or... kate:	what picture was that? stocz:	first when i come establish myself in united states and greenhorn. put it that way because it’s hard to pick the language up. kate:	did anybody call you a greenhorn? stocz:	yes. some guy called me different name and i go home i ask my brother about that what mean. i know i [unclear 01:10:11] and he explained it to me. next day i go out to work again, he called me again. i growl like a tiger. good thing i catch up with him. i catch up. i grab him and throw him between the bunch of iron.  he run up in the superintendent’s office, i can’t talk in english. hungarian was good enough to repeat his voice in english. he called me; i never called anybody that name, dirty name. superintendent look at me, the fellow explained what name he called me, and superintendent told him, “you go home, after three months i call you back if we need you. you’ll go back to work”. kate:	this is to the fellow who called you the name? stocz:	the fellow who called me the bad name. kate:	was let go? stocz:	yes, and i remained here. i worked here about 14 year with the company. kate:	which company was that? stocz:	west lynchburg merged with [unclear 01:11:59]. kate:	what kind of company was that? stocz:	steel mill. kate:	we’re going to back just a bit. we’ve gotten to the point where you have your bags packed. did anyone see you off? did they have a party for you? stocz:	no, before i left village in europe, you grow up to get it and last evening you spent together and wish all kind of luck and i hope you can go out. i brought romanian money; i don’t know how many hundred dollars, in romanian. i can’t use it. even the bank no want it, so i burn it. kate:	you burnt the money? stocz:	yes, romanian money. i can’t use it; i can’t spend it, why i keep it? i don’t want to send it home, costs money to send it home. kate:	where did you burn that? when you were in the states? stocz:	yes. kate:	let’s go back to this night before you left. stocz:	we had a good party. kate:	you had a party? stocz:	yes. kate:	in your town? stocz:	yes. kate:	how did your father and stepmother react when you left? stocz:	dad no like it and stepmother she no like anne. she was a good stepmother and i can’t say a bad word against her. she was a nice human person. i grow up under her; i don’t know nothing of my own mother.   dad was strict like i was with my boys. i no repeated either; you have to do this or do that. that’s that, and thanks god they grow up and listen to me. too bad i lost older son. he was good-hearted. the second one take after me, quick and outrageous. i no take no bullshit even when i can’t talk. kate:	how did you lose your first son?

stocz:	she had a hard time; two doctor was taking care of her. with the boys she was out like fish in a pond, no trouble at all. the second one, we call up the doctor, come on out she in labor. before the doctor reached over the house she had the baby; no trouble at all. kate:	who delivered that baby? stocz:	the doctor. he was visit already before the doctor arrived and cleaned the baby up, take care of my wife. kate:	we should go back to coming here to the states because i need to know what you remember about that voyage, what port you took off from. when you were leaving for america what port did you come through? stocz:	west germany to england, and from england, big boat. the boat’s name, white star. kate:	which port in west germany was it? stocz:	i can’t tell you now. i remember they had little houses there and field. from there we go in a small ship in england. kate:	where in england were you? what port? stocz:	that i can’t remember. kate:	southampton? stocz:	i can’t remember. i know it’s a city on big buildings. i know i had a bleeding nose and i’ll never forget it either. i lay on the table and hang my head down. i was afraid somebody catch me and ship me back. before i leave there, i get some paper and write the thing and tell them. what port? i know it was a big one. when we get on the ship, the fifth evening we see the light, new york, light all over. they no let us in. they keep us on the ship three days. kate:	no wait. let’s go back just a little bit. i need some more information about this. how did you get from home to west germany? stocz:	with a train. kate:	how did you get to the train? stocz:	walk. kate:	you walked to the train, and you took a train to west germany? stocz:	yes. kate:	on the boat in england… stocz:	from germany small boat took us in england. kate:	how long did that take? stocz:	about a night and a day. kate:	who was on that boat? were there other hungarians? who was on the boat from germany to england? stocz:	we was five of us from the same village. aunt mary, a husband and wife, and a baby… six of us, and a lady and i and another one he get shipped back. they no let him in.  kate:	why? stocz:	in [unclear 01:25:13] you have to go through lot of doctors. kate:	what’s [unclear 01:25:22]? what is this? stocz:	before you board, there they keep you for three day then you go through physical. kate:	so you had your physical examination before you got to the states? stocz:	on a ship, then when you get off from the ship you go again at the united states and to europe, then you go channel and everybody have to go through that.  kate:	six of you came from the same village? stocz:	yes. kate:	one was sent back for medical reasons? stocz:	yes. kate:	from germany? stocz:	no, from the port. kate:	what exactly before you came did you know about the united states? what did you know about america? stocz:	that my brother wrote me, “if you can come on out you had a better future in your life than stay in europe.” kate:	what else did you know? stocz:	not much. we study that in school and so long you work here in school, america is many factories for business so i said to myself nothing to lose, everything to gain. at 16 year old i was like i am today, just i no had no belly. i never was afraid to work.  like a greenhorn you do more for work like you should because you’re afraid you’ll get laid off and you want to keep your job. in a way to speak you can’t answer back, they show you what to do. other people shall break you in work. you’re like a lamb; you do what they tell you to do to keep your job.   the foreign people build united states up like it is today. the younger generation won’t admit it. lot of time it’s on the news. the foreign people from all over the world come here and build united states up like it is. the second generation, this generation, no believe it. my kind of work, broken english, are you hunky? kate:	did people call you hunky? stocz:	in kidding way. kate:	not meanly?  stocz:	no. they said, “you hunky, why don’t you learn how to talk in english?” i said, “listen here, i bring money in this country. what you bring when you born? i’m a better american like you do. i never was in cheer leader. don’t call me hunky.” and i protect myself; i was able to protect myself.   the foreman said, “you learn fast”, i said, “that’s the truth. i have to have $50 to show before i step american soil and you guys born here. i bring money in this country”. they no like it and that’s the truth. if you think through your life, people born here in united states bring nothing; they’re born here. i was a farmer and i had to have $50 to bring to this country. in other words they no let me in. that’s the rule. kate:	when you were back on that boat, you said they gave medical examinations on that boat between germany and england. one person was sent back. why? stocz:	that i can’t answer. i’m not a doctor. kate:	did they tell him or her? was it a woman or a man? stocz:	we never find out other five people were come. when the [unclear 01:32:03] the people, the who no pass, they not let them to the other people. they put them in a separate room for rejects and you never see him no more. you have no more chance to ask why. in america you can’t talk. they open a book every people in the room where you have to read. if you can’t read, you’re out of luck, didn’t let you in. kate:	on this boat, what examination did they give you before you got to england? stocz:	they look you all over, three doctor, specialists. if you had disease you no have no chance.  kate:	what disease for example? what were the common things? stocz:	god know what they were looking for. kate:	okay. so you got to england? stocz:	yes, and when you get off from the ship you go to the same channel and they ask you, “you like the girls? you was meeting the girls?” kate:	they asked you what? stocz:	single, whether you was meeting a girl, whether you love girls. the doctor ask, you have to answer yes or no. [unclear 01:34:05] didn’t know either way who was meeting a girl and who knows meeting a girl. doctor asked about education, they look you all over, even look in your bottom with glasses. kate:	there’s one thing i haven’t asked you yet and i’m supposed to ask you and that is, when you got from hungary to germany, did you have to wait overnight? stocz:	yes. i spend and if i no sneak away romania and they grab me and send me in army again. i sneak out from father’s village and hide in germany eight weeks. kate:	you went from hungary. you said six people went from your village. you all met in germany. but you had been in germany eight weeks, with whom? stocz:	we had some barracks. through the war they use soldiers slept there include in price. they say you no have to pay no more because… kate:	food was given to you? stocz:	yes. kate:	you had been in the army once. you had to go to germany because you had to sneak away because you knew they were going to put you back in the army? stocz:	yes, i know.  kate:	so you arranged quickly to leave to germany?   stocz:	that’s right. they hunted me when i [unclear 01:36:13] he ask father where is the son? “i don’t know, he took off, didn’t say nothing”. of course he lied to him. kate:	how did you get your papers then? stocz:	i had the paper in my passport. kate:	you didn’t have to apply for permission? stocz:	i supply it took me six months then i get a visa. kate:	to the states? stocz:	yes. when i got the visa then i sneak out. kate:	okay. so as long as you got to germany it was okay. what’s the trip like from germany to england? stocz:	i was in germany six week all of us. kate:	what was that like? stocz:	after six weeks they put us on a small ship and sent that ship in england, big port. from england, we go on the white star ship, big ship, and i climb on the first class, second class, i was on third class on the bottom. i always was on the ship. i like to see how the ship cut the water in two. i was fascinated. the ship wanted to give me a job. they always find me late evening and early morning. it was fascinating. i never see a ship in europe. kate:	in this six to eight week, however long you were in germany in this big barracks, that was arranged by whom? who arranged that? you just showed up and stayed? stocz:	when you supply you pay in one lump, the cost. it’s a cooperation who take responsibility. you get here and you have to pay so much money and the cooperation write everything. kate:	why two months? six weeks, why two months, why not three weeks? stocz:	that i can’t answer. kate:	who was in that barracks with you? who did you share space with? stocz:	people who want to come in united states. kate:	they had to wait that long too? stocz:	yes. kate:	what did you do for two months? stocz:	we was lucky. when we arrive in the united states the other ship, he was before us, we pull later in and they took our ship before theirs and i was surprised we spent three days on a ship. the ship pull in early. they make the trip five day. kate:	you never went through canada, you came straight. did you go through nova scotia? stocz:	europe had the most people had to go through the same channel, that’s staten island. they had a big building there, and doctors. kate:	ellis island. stocz:	professional people. kate:	you’re on the boat. did you spend time on the boat with the other people from your village? stocz:	yes. kate:	you travelled together? stocz:	yes. kate:	you were in third class? stocz:	yes. kate:	with whom were you with in that cabin? stocz:	everyone had a different cabin. they build if you had two people, if you have families, three, four bed in the cabin, and they had single, if you’re single people. they put you in a cabin; every cabin has a number. kate:	you were in what type of cabin? stocz:	good, nice one. kate:	by yourself? stocz:	yes. kate:	what was the food condition? did you eat with your people food? stocz:	believe me i can’t think enough. they serve buns, white bread. i grab them with both hands not with one hand; the meat, excellent. in the morning coffee, donuts, buns, whatever your heart desired. europe people never eat that good. through the five day we live like a king. kate:	what about the voyage? what type of water, was it smooth, rough? stocz:	i can say smooth, and far away from the ship you see on the water, animals jump up like fish on the water; animals in the ocean you see it. five days that was enough. we come in five days and we was here. kate:	when did the ship depart? what date from england? stocz:	on the ship we have to wait three day. after three day you go to examination and when they finish with examination, lot of people there, they put you in a big room and everybody be bench know which way the bench to get it. you go in pennsylvania, you go someplace else, a group here a group there, all in all direction and you wait for your train. you see where you come out with five people.   one lady she was here in united states and she come home for a visit. if she love it then the husband go home too. she no love europe, she come back the same time when i come. she talked in english, good english and they reject her. she no allowed to be with us. after a day they visit her again, and she pass and she said, “steve, god knows we’ll see each other or not. goodbye.” her husband was on the ship.

stocz:	yes. kate:	you have information they told you?  stocz:	yes. kate:	did you hear of anyone besides being turned away? stocz:	like i said that i can’t answer because this lady with this man he no pass the examination. two ways, one go left and one go right. when you go the right aisle you pass the examination. when they find something wrong you go left, and they send him back in europe. he reached home and i don’t know to this day what kind of sickness he had. it was doctor, not me.   not long ago i was taking examination with dr. wilson. he went and he sent me to another doctor and stick a pipe down and they want to know i am cured, no had no cancer inside. the boys start to talk, “take it, take it”, i said, “you’re a doctor?” he said, “i’m grown up. you don’t have to [unclear 02:00:26] me.” then he said, “get out of my deck.” dr. wilson he’s been around. his [unclear 02:00:37] just go up and down the lab… kate:	were you detained at all at ellis island?
