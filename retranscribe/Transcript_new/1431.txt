rogers:	 it wasn’t a very- we came steerage i think you noticed that.  elisa:	 mmmmh rogers: 	we came with an uncle and he was a doctor. while he left us there, we met him when we came on the boat but we never saw him again because he was in second class and we were in steerage. it was crowded. elisa: 	do you remember where you slept on the boat? rogers: 	yes. we had a cabin. but we shared with another couple elisa: 	where were they from? rogers:	i don’t know. there were some people were from all countries. there were from all over- i don’t remember where they were from but it was exciting because they had a lot of activities like, you wouldn’t believe the way- they'd had a good time aboard ship. elisa:	what would they do at a party? can you describe one? rogers: 	oh they played accordions and they played music and they just danced. they had a good time but we just sat there because we were kids and we had nobody. elisa: 	did you speak english at all? rogers: 	beg your pardon? elisa: 	did you speak any english? rogers: 	no, no, no. we didn’t but when i came to this country it didn’t take me very long because i think i was reading before i was here a month, i  was reading on the book of knowledge, anything i could get a hold of because before i came to this country i loved to read.  and they told me when i got here, you can’t read, you can’t read the books. so i didn’t want that to happen. i wanted to read. elisa: 	so you learned very quickly? rogers: 	yes, i learned. elisa: 	how long were you on this boat? do you remember? rogers:	 i think it must have been about 10days. elisa: 	and do you remember eating? do you remember going to meals? rogers: 	yes. elisa: 	what did you have? rogers: 	it was served- what would you say- big tables, a lot of people ate there. elisa: 	what would they serve you for dinner? let’s say, or what would you have for lunch? do you remember any meals?- rogers:	 no. i don’t anything, the only thing i know that they served peaches, and my brother’s name is pete and we called him peachen. well, we thought that was funny, because he said peaches.  but you didn’t dare take anything with you. a slice of bread, a cookie or anything when you were eating. they took it away from you. you couldn’t take it but there was plenty food. elisa: 	do you remember if the boat was- if the sea was rough or smooth sailing? rogers:	 i didn’t get that one. elisa: 	was there any storms? were you sea sick? when you were on the boat were you sea sick? rogers: 	i wasn’t but my sister was really sea sick. she was sick. elisa: 	do you remember going out on deck and looking? rogers: 	oh yes, i remember sitting on the deck when the waves was so high. they swept over the bench and we had no business sitting out here but we were- it got rough and you had to walk up instead of straight. it all seemed so far away. elisa: 	do you remember seeing land for the first time? rogers: 	yes. that’s the first thing we saw was ellis island. elisa:	do you remember seeing the statue of liberty? rogers: 	what? elisa: 	the statue of liberty? rogers:	 [laughter] okay. elisa:	 i think there is a story to tell here. rogers: 	well, i was 15 years old, and i never paid much attention to boys because- i never not one never paid any attention. but there was a young sailor there and he brought me a half of water melon. i had never seen a water melon. i thought it was some kind of fish so my sister and i threw it over board. elisa:	[laughter] oh, what a great story. rogers:	we wouldn’t eat it. elisa: 	because you just didn’t know what it was. rogers: 	didn’t know what it was. i think that was the first time i tasted america ice-cream too. elisa: 	and what did you think of that? rogers: 	which was real good? he brought it to me. but i was-like i said- i was still a little girl. elisa: 	do you remember the statue, statue of liberty? rogers: 	yes, i do but then we didn’t pay much attention to it. we knew it was there and that was it. elisa: 	and what did you think when you arrived at ellis island, where there doctors that came on the boat to see you? did you get right off the boat? how long did you have to stay? rogers: 	i don’t remember so much about it, i do remember we got off the boat, and got on ellis island and i remember landing there. you see, nobody paid any attention to us. we had money, but it was dutch and french money.  so when we landed, here we were with our luggage, nobody to take our luggage. we didn’t have any money to pay to have it taken away. so someone felt sorry for us and had it put on a ferry. i think it was a ferry to ellis island, and then once we got [unclear 00:20: 29] we got in trouble because aboard ship we were supposed to have shots which we didn’t get. so when we get at [unclear 00:20:41] we were supposed to show it. but when we got to ellis island, we didn’t have the card stamped. so they kept as there. elisa: 	how long did you stay? rogers: 	seven days. while somebody was waiting in new york to take as back to south dakota and ellis island was another thing a lot like on a boat. there was so many people there from foreign countries and they all had a good time. they all celebrated and danced.  but i remember there was great big windows and they were high up, you couldn’t look out. i used to stand on my brothers back. he stood on my back, so we could look out of the windows to see america. elisa:	did the doctors on ellis island- do you remember seeing doctors when you were on ellis island? rogers: 	yes, we had to have the shots. elisa: 	so you remember that, were the doctors nice to you- rogers:	no, i don’t remember, we had to stay there. it was about six or seven days. i know it was a week or saw that we could- elisa: 	what did you do during the day when you were staying in ellis island? rogers: 	just there. nothing to do. elisa: 	where did you sleep? rogers: 	well they had- this sounds funny maybe i was dreaming i don’t know- there rooms, i saw pictures of it already. it was a great big dormitory but there weren’t beds like these, they were stacked. but they were wired, like cages almost there was a big room full of those beds and that’s where we stayed.  elisa:	do you remember playing on elis island going outside? did you stay inside most of the time? rogers:	 no, we never were let out of the room, we never come outside. it was almost like being in jail, i guess but we didn’t know any better. elisa: 	do you remember meeting any people at ellis island? rogers:	 no elisa: 	how about eating at ellis island? do you remember going and having food there, lunch or dinner? rogers: 	no, you mean on ellis island? elisa:	 yes. rogers: 	you know we were shy we didn’t even dare talk to anybody. i think that was it and scared too.  elisa: 	what can you tell me about when you were allowed to leave ellis island? rogers: 	when i what? elisa: 	when you were allowed to leave ellis island, tell me about that. they came in and told you- rogers: 	honey i didn’t get that. elisa: 	tell me about leaving elis island, leaving ellis island? rogers:	yeah, elisa: 	who came to pick you up? rogers: 	my uncle, he didn’t come pick us up at ellis island, we took the ferry again to new york, and he picked as up there and we stayed in a hotel for a couple of days i think. the name of the hotel was [unclear 00:24:02] and he took as to sioux falls, south dakota. elisa:	do you remember- what did you think of new york? rogers: 	it was just too big to imagine coming from a little tiny country. it was really something. elisa: 	how did you get to sioux falls? rogers: 	by train, by train and we had a booth on the train. but guessing i slept together and you could imagine two of them sleeping in the same tiny booth and fighting because we were just kids.  and we had meals, beautiful meals, and i remember eating corn on the comb which i never had before and it had two little things on the side, didn’t know how to eat them [laughter]. elisa:	what else did you have to eat on the train?
