morris:	 i can’t remember my mother because i can’t remember.  kate:	how about your father, what was your father’s name? what was your father’s name? morris:	charles thomas abel.  kate:	yes. morris:	and he was very strict. but he ruled us with his eyes. if we did anything out of place he would-- just that. kate:	give you the look? morris:	yes, give us a look. and i’ll always remember going back with my 18 month old daughter and he brought a few friends and there was one man there i couldn’t stand george, my brother’s friend and i said something and everybody stopped eating and looked at my father including me and excused myself from the table and went into the bedroom but my dad always ruled us with his eyes. kate:	what was your father’s occupation? morris:	he was a bricklayer. kate:	a bricklayer and would you name your brothers and sisters please? morris:	i had no sisters. i had charles, he was nine years old when and-- alex:	john. morris:	john, no john was—john was the last one, john and david. david was my stepmother’s son kate:	and how would you describe your father physically --? morris:	just a minute. just a minute, there were three brothers. alex:	john and-- morris:	charles alex:	charles and john and then your second mother. morris:	oh yes charles and john but-- alex:	[inaudible 00:05:01] mitchel is their mother.  morris:	why can’t i remember?

what did your father look like physically? morris:	he was five foot eleven. my mother was only four foot ten. and he wore a moustache and when he got mad, he’d twirl his moustache.  alex:	he was typical sergeant major. i mean [inaudible 00:05:53]    morris:	oh yes, no we wasn’t. he was warden. alex:	no, but then, his appearance morris:	his appearance he was very military. kate:	hold on a second. we were speaking about your father. morris:	yes, one day a man came and asked for colonel tom and i said, “i’m sorry you’ve got the wrong house, we have no colonel tom here,’ and my father came up behind me, he says, ‘what do you want my man?” he was called colonel tom on the job because he was so military looking.  he was captain of the football team in north london and his father died when he was young and he and his brother went to an orphanage. and they weren’t taught anything there except how to scrub tables and scrub floors and clean shoes but he was self-taught.  so when we sat down at the table we’d have a dictionary on the table. to and my brother who was nine years older than i would speak to dad and my father would say, “do you understand what he’s saying?” look it up in the dictionary. so i had to look it up in the dictionary. so my vocabulary was very good when i came over here, i’ve lost it now. [laughs] kate:	but where did you leave? what kind of house did you live in as a child? morris:	56 council street. a row of houses, two rows of houses and they were built, one wall was the wall of the next house you see and so, we had just a small garden behind. wasn’t a garden really, it was where the toilet was and my father brought the toilet up from the bottom next to the house and he built a shed on the top of it and he was told it was really unhygienic bringing the toilet so close to the house.  	and we used to have a kitchen which was a dining room also. and a front row and the fire place was in the corner of the room and it was only put on when we had to have it on. we had a cupboard in the kitchen, a big cupboard that went from the floor to the top and i used to have to climb on a chair to get what mum wanted. and when--? 	[crosstalk]  	pardon? alex:	how many bedrooms? morris:	two, one for the girls-- kate:	two bedrooms  morris:	two bedrooms, one for the girl and i was- don’t worry about that. and i was partition off my father and mother’s room. my brothers had the other bedroom. kate:	now what about water source? what type of plumbing did you have? alex:	did you have a water [inaudible 00:09:15]? morris:	i don’t remember. kate:	okay, what about heating, how did you heat the house?  morris:	a fireplace. kate:	what about lighting? morris:	gas and when we went out to go to the cinema it was only a penny to go to the cinema and when we came back, i’d walk between my father and mother and my father would go a little further ahead when we neared the house and he’d go put the gas on then we could go in. kate:	and what about, did you have a garden? morris:	no, but at the end of the street was a tip. the train used to come up from the valley, round the tip. was called a slug from--he’d come round the valley, round this tip and go on to the brickyard where they made bricks and he knew what we were doing.  so he would toot his horn let us know he was coming and we’d be at the top with a tin tray and slide down trying to get down before the train got there. we used to play hide go seek in the tracks and the tracks they were entrance for track went down instead of sliding and we were playing hide and seek and i got caught with one of the leads and cut my head open here and i went home. my step mum fainted at the sight of blood.  kate:	did she faint?  morris:	yes, she fainted. kate;	well, your father remarried then you had a step mother.  at what age? morris:	when my mum knew she was dying. she told dad to marry tilly, rachael matilda davies. who was welsh and her mother didn’t speak english until she was 40. anyway tilly, she was a good mother, she broke her engagement to someone else to marry my dad because in wales there’s an unwritten law that a man didn’t bring up his daughter, i would have to go to an orphanage so to stop that, tilly married my dad and she had a boy to him, david. now where my mother was buried, can i go back a little bit?  kate:	yes, sure. morris:	when my mother was very ill, i went over to aunty bessie’s house. that’s my father’s brother’s wife and we could see the house and they pulled the blinds down. and i said to aunty bessie, “what are they pulling the blinds down for?” and uncle bill said, “you’ll find out.” i said, “who’s gone?” “she’s gone.” i said, “who’s gone?” he said, “your mother,” and i didn’t understand what he was talking about so when i run over home, my father was in the room sobbing his heart out.  kate:	what were the practices in wales at that time for burial? was it was it very somber event? alex:	everyone dressed in black? morris:	oh yes, dressed in black i couldn’t have dressed in black because i couldn’t afford to buy any black but my father said if they wanted to find me, they would go up to the cemetery and i’d be on my mother’s grave and she was buried next to a mrs. kane, her name was abel [laughs] and that was the only way i knew where she was buried. kate:	your father remarried then shortly thereafter, how long afterwards then? morris:	well when i was six. she died when i was four. kate:	i see. she died when you were four and remarried when you were six. kate:	what was your stepmother- what was her role did she work outside the house? morris:	she was a housekeeper. kate:	and who did the cooking in the family? morris:	she did. kate:	and what was your favorite food? morris:	i don’t know [laughs].  kate:	how about-- and did you help her at all?

alex:	[inaudible 00:15:35]. morris:	yes, because she didn’t want to get caught. kate:	and so what was school life? tell me about your school life. morris:	my brother took me to school first. i always remember that because i didn’t want to go to school. kate:	at what age did you go? morris:	five. kate:	five. morris:	and he dragged me up the hill to school and when i got there, i shrieked. so the headmistress sent me back home [laughs]. kate:	and did you eventually like it? morris:	yes. yes i loved it. kate	and what was your favorite subject? morris:	history. kate:	and how far was the school from your house? morris:	just around the corner. kate:	what was the name of the teacher who taught you secretly welsh? do you remember? morris:	ms. gulliver?

what was your religious back then? morris:	my father was a congregationalist and he was what they called an elder in the congregation. now he just went to see that the church was clean and the pulpit was alright. he didn’t do any cleaning because he was a bricklayer and we used to go downstairs to sunday school and the benches there were made so that they could go up and form a table.  and every easter time, no, whitsun time its six weeks after easter. we would- my brother the older brother and i would sing duets and we would practice my aunt sarah, tilly mum’s sister would play the piano in the church and my father would sit right at the back of the church and if he couldn’t hear every word, he’d bang on the seat.  do it over again and i would have to do it over again until i did it so that he could understand every word. and in school we had to say “round and round the rugged rock the rugged rascal run” to learn to pronounce the rs and my dad had to hear every word and the very last song we sung- i was short and fat and my brother was tall and thin.  and he had a high tenor voice and i had a low alto voice so he used to always laugh when he saw i was going on the stage but the very last time, he stood right at the back of the church and i was at the stage singing? do you want me to sing? kate:	yes, sure. morris:	singing 	that would be my brother singing right at the back and everybody turned around my brother’s voice came from and there are two more verses but i won’t sing [laughter]. when i came to salt lake, i met with a welsh lady, davies her name was and she played that song for me, she knew it. kate:	now at home did you have prayers before-- grace before meals?

	part and yes say while life in you last, that will be fine and so he did and his name was joseph j canon. we used to have a millennial course over there, a group of missionaries get together and we would sing. and i had to stay in raven’s lane two weeks to establish residence. and i used to help the girl dust the stairways and things like that. and we were talking about the millennial chorus and i said, they sing beautiful but no heart. “this is how they should sing”. and so i sung-- alex:	went along. morris:	went along and i really dramatized it and then i heard someone clapping. burt teddington who was the soloist in the millennium chorus came out. he said, “that was very good ivy”. i said, “why you don’t put some heart in it then”. so he did his best. kate:	back up a bit. you mentioned that your father was congregationalist how did you become mormon? morris:	we moved to london to a place called chiswick, london and i went to on domestic work when i was 14 then i left that place because she was german. she wanted me to walk tow paces behind her and i said madam i do not work 2 paces behind anybody. so i gave my notice each month. it was a family appointment.  my mother had worked there, her sisters had worked there, her cousins it was my turn now. from there, i went to work in a baker shop in the house [inaudible00:24:00] and i wouldn’t eat [inaudible00:24:00] bread for ages afterward because we used to put that fruit at our table and bugs would come and you couldn’t tell which were bugs and which were fruit. anyway i left there and we moved, we were in fulham then london and we were over at garten’s clothing shop. was that in [inaudible00:24:00] alex:	yes. morris:	my stepmother’s sister lived just over the bridge. when we first moved to fulham, a carillion you know what a carillion is? played in st. mary’s the other side of the bridge and i said to my mum, “they are playing us in, they’re congratulating us for coming” [laughs] and you know- who was that man that was a traitor in america? kate:	benedict arnold. morris:	benedict arnold. he’s buried in that place. he and his wife and i went afterwards to have a look. we used to watch the oxford and cambridge boats rise. i’m sorry. kate:	that alright. you used to watch oxford and cambridge boats.  morris:	and so how did you decide to change? morris:	well, we lived in chiswick and there was—i went to work in another house and the housekeeper there, was fond of the elders. and when [inaudible00:25:53] give him a snack and things like that and i came from my day off and i sat between them by the fire and i asked questions and when one was taking a breath the other one finished the sentence, that sort of thing.  that’s how i got to find the mormons. and then i went up to hyde park which is speakers common used to be, not now and the elders used to hold their meetings there and there was a young welsh woman there, gladys parks. she used to take the hecklers, tap them on the shoulder and take them away and answer their questions for them, so that the speaker could stand up and speak in peace.  and then one day there was a minister man with an umbrella in the front of elder peterson and he hit the elder on his head and it bled and the elder said. “if i wasn’t on my mission i’d come down there and show you what for”.  sparks, she was shorter than me not saying something but she was a welsh girl and she and i got very friendly and she started to talk to me about the mormons then i found that there was a mormon meeting house down at chiswick down duke’s road and was it was held in a place where the men used to meet and they smoke and they drank.  before they had the meeting they had to clean out the building before we could have it for a meeting. alex:	the kind of meetings they had all over the country in those days. morris:	yes, so brother william c. mark cormick was the branch president then and he wouldn’t take his hat off. and i said to him, “brother mark, why don’t you want to take your hat off and he said, “i don’t want you to see my horns” [laughs]. alex:	[inaudible00:28:08]. kate:	no, no that’s fine that’s fine. and-- so you were how old then when you changed religions? morris:	well, i couldn’t join the church until i was 21 but i went to church when i was 18. kate:	and why couldn’t you join till you’re 21? morris:	because that was the ruling of the church.  alex:	[unclear 00:28:30]. morris:	my father couldn’t give me permission, he couldn’t see why i couldn’t  go to their church and so while i was there, i was first council of the society, first council in primary and in charge of all the bee hives of london and i learned to cycle [laughs]. kate:	so then you met your husband. how did you meet your husband? morris:	well, they have a ymca. ymca? no. the very first one in kidderminster alex:	young people gathering. morris:	yes, very first one in britain and i learned to ride a bike by going down a gully, i liked that and i cycle with jack tar, who was a friend of ours- mine [laughs] and we cycled all the way from london to kidderminster 130 miles.  i was told that there was a green and gold ball at night and you had to wear either green or gold but i didn’t have either. so i borrowed a green tied it up a newspaper in the back of my bike. he came down in an evening suit in a car. alex:	i mean i was i was the master of ceremony for the dance that’s why. morris:	yes, and i had never danced because my father said it was the devil’s workshop. so i never went dancing. kate:	and did you dance [laughs]? morris:	when we got there, we got there in the morning and we went to a bed and breakfast place. he asked them to ask his landlady different place, to press his suit. my dress was that stiff – that stiff material. alex:	organdy? morris:	organdy and it looked like [inaudible00:30:51] but what did it matter, i wasn’t dancing anyway. so i went to the dancehall to the place where they were having this gold green ball and jack said to me now you watch him and the he’s just going to go like this and the girls come running. i say, “[unclear 00:31:08] he came up and asked for a dance said i don’t dance but we danced, we jogged anyway. kate:	hold on i’m going to change this.  alex:	got a question. kate:	i will i will she’s fine though just let her be. here we go. morris:	i was in charge of that.  kate:	so? morris:	when we walked and [inaudible00:31:44] stood up and said, “i think you people here should know what’s going on between north and south.” and he spoke on in english embarrassing but anyway, after that was over, we went to church on a sunday and he was in his scout uniform, the shorts.  we had to go up steps to get-- i had to go up steps to get to up to the church and i went up and i saw his boots and i saw his knees. he always says, i fell i love with his knees [laughter] and then we went into church had testimonies and we were walking home and i was walking between alec and burt perry and they kept hitching. i said, “for goodness sake stop hitching”, so they stopped and their pants went down, so hitch, anyway i cycled home with jack and when i got home i was so tired then. i can’t remember what i did. kate:	and how old were you then exactly? morris:	let me see now. i was a member of the church but only just-- kate:	21. morris:	i was 21, when we left each other, he says, “i will let you know if you’re it.” i say, “let me know what?” “i’ll let you know if you’re going to be my wife”. i said, “well enough.” kate:	is that the first meeting? morris:	yes, no when we were living on a monday. kate:	on a monday right. morris:	yes. so, two weeks afterwards he wrote and said, “you’re the one”.  kate:	and you married? morris:	so he came down to see my parents and when i told my dad i wanted to marry alec, “a pagan, a scotsman and a mormon at that?” my dad my dad was really most polite usually but not with alex. he had to peep in front of his face the whole time alex was there. he says, “well i suppose if you want to get married, you can get married.” my dad was a londoner and londoners do not like scott people. when we went on our missions, alex told him that his parent were from aberdeen. he wouldn’t dare say he was from north england. i say i was born in wales, that was fine i was accepted straight away because they are catholics, not [unclear 00:34:39], catholic. kate:	and so how did you get to the united states. what was the path? you married and then you did you have children? morris:	i had three children-- four children when we got the one died and alex said i was too demanding because i used to pray to father and ask him for a girl and a boy and a girl and a boy i got those. but the boy i always carried my-- have you ever had children?  kate:	no. morris:	i used to carry them breech across this way and doctor had to turn them you see. well i told the doctor that. in those days you couldn’t choose your doctor and i had to go to an irish doctor catholic doctor and i told him that my baby was breech, “would you please turn it”? he says, “you’re telling me what to do?” and he wouldn’t turn it. so when the baby came, he came out body first and he broke his neck and then he wanted to throw it into furnace. i said, “no you don’t, my husband will take it”. and he took it and buried him somewhere. we called him sandy because alex usually called sandy when he was in [inaudible00:36:01].  kate:	so you have three surviving children? morris:	i brought three over with me. kate:	you brought three with you? and what year did you come over? morris:	1952. kate:	and the children were how old at that time? morris:	ruth was 13, allan was 11 and ann was five. kate:	and what brought you to the united states? morris:	the need to go to the temple.  kate:	so your faith at the time, the church and what significance did that have to you the temple then you living here? morris:	because outside you are just married till death do you part. but in the temple you are married for time and all eternity if you’re faithful and that’s why we wanted to get married in the temple. kate:	so were you married in the temple? morris:	in salt lake camphor. kate:	but you were married first— morris:	in [unclear 00:37:07]. kate:	and so you came over here, tell me about the voyage. what port did you use? morris:	southampton. kate:	and what did you take with you? morris:	change of clothing. and i had a [inaudible00:37:28] costume and i was too embarrassed to wear it because i would have people come up and ask, when did you come from scotland. but i brought were blankets just a few necessities that we could carry ourselves. kate:	when you came out what was the name of the boat? morris:	he told you what the name was. kate:	we’ll check that later. what about the voyage? what do you remember about the voyage? morris:	we came out of the channel and he told me it was all in my mind i wasn’t ill. i was fearing they’d be sick, seasick and there was a heavy storm at sea and so the boat had to go way round to avoid the storm and we got to newfoundland and we watched them. i went up on the first class deck. and an american woman said, “what are those brats doing up here?” so i said excuse me, “your children may be brats but mine are children”. i did not like the american’s very much. kate:	and you were down in- what part of the boat where you, steerage? morris:	down. kate:	what class did you come for? morris:	2nd class. kate:	2nd class but there was no 3rd?  morris:	i don’t think so that’s where the luggage was it was only a small boat. kate:	and how did you have the accommodations in the boat? did you have you own cabin? morris:	we had a cabin and a baby’s crib there which didn’t help me [laughs] and the children’s beds were- ann was the only one who wasn’t seasick and she’d come up and tell us what she had for dinner. and we had a danish steward at the dinner table. and the table was built so they had a ledge if the boat wobbled the plate wouldn’t go off the table but that steward would treat her like his daughter and give her everything she wanted. and she came up and said, “oh mum i had—“i said, “don’t tell me”. kate:	was there anyone who was sick besides you? morris:	alex was sick. yes, the only one who wasn’t sick was ann.  kate:	and before you left, did you had a medical examination at all? morris:	yes. kate:	what did you have that? morris:	we had that in liverpool.  kate:	in liverpool. morris:	and there i was told that my right eardrum was cracked. i was in london during world war 2 with all the bombing. it cracked my ear i was between two and the aircraft batteries .i knew i was deaf but i didn’t know why.  let me go back a bit, you’re not lds but i’ll tell you alex was 48 hours leave to come home and take me down from hexham down to london. we had a coal ration so we couldn’t take it down with us. so we had no fire, no heat from december until march or april. kate:	what year? morris:	[inaudible00:41:24] he joined the army.  kate:	this was during the second world war? morris:	yes, of course, i was only born in first world war and the people in london, of the church members in london found us a little flat. and alex came and he dedicated the home from any danger. and so when the bombing came, i stayed in the house.  he said now, “don’t lock the window or the doors” and when the blast came it just went through the house and out at the back. and ours was the only house to exist without cracked windows and no cracked walls. my father’s house, there they had ornamental caster around them for light and that came down and dad saw it and pushed my mum out and fell out the other side and smashed his face. but our house wasn’t touched. i’m talking too much. kate:	no, no you’re not at all. this is interesting and so when you came by boat, do you remember seeing land for the first time? morris:	the first time i saw land was seeing the lady with the lamp. kate:	the statue of liberty?  morris:	statue of liberty. kate	and did it mean anything to you?  morris:	i just got excited and i said, “look we’re going to the land of freedom”.  kate:	and do you remember what happened then? do you remember ellis island? you mentioned to me that you came through ellis island. do you remember much about that?  morris:	no. kate:	and why do you think you didn’t? you were sick. morris:	well, i was sick but we just got off and went through customs. i can’t remember that. but we got a taxi cab and we only had english money and the cab driver took every penny we had.  we went into a station at new york and we explained to the woman behind the desk and she paid for our fair to pennsylvania. when we came back i paid her the money back and she was surprised. i thanked her for being so kind to us.  we’d been on strict rations right up to the time we came here and the house we went to was a state’s prison house i’m sure. when we came down for breakfast there was a table full of cereal and i said to alex, “they’re not on rations here obviously”. but it was good. kate:	what about the trip across country then, how long did that take? you said you came to salt lake city. morris:	yes, we came in the westside and we changed in chicago to another bus. kate:	and how did you come by what way? morris:	by bus.  kate:	by bus. morris: 	yes and i was so sick.  i vomited when i got to chicago and got on the bus then i slept most of the way. that’s the only way i could do it, the only way i could travel. kate:	to this day do you have difficulty in buses? morris:	no. kate:	no. morris:	 i’m a woman now we came in on the westside and the houses were down. i said to my husband, “they must eat a terrible amount of chicken and eggs here. those are all chicken coops down there.” of course we went and looked there and saw it wasn’t chicken coops. kate:	and so you came here what was the address you first came to? morris:	oh goodness, he told you the address i can’t remember it. kate:	but the house that you lived in here how was it in comparison to the conditions that you had back in england? morris:	well, the [inaudible 00:45:39] house they had children well, teenagers and they put a bathroom when they knew we were coming but he told you we slept in a caravan. kate:	how long did you sleep in a caravan? morris:	just a few days. kate:	and then, then where did you go? morris:	the bishop was an interior decorator and so he managed to get us a little cottage, little cottage? it’s just one place really but he built a wall separating the front room from the bedroom. and we had two beds one on top of the other. kate:	bunk beds. morris:	bunk beds for the boys and my husband and i slept in the other parts you see and there was a beautiful christmas tree there with presents for the children. so the owner of the place didn’t charge us rent or anything and he was finishing off his house. they were very good, i can’t remember their name but they were very good to us.  kate:	you said, you mentioned earlier that you had another child then after coming here did you have another child? morris:	twins. kate:	twins? twin boys what were their names? morris:	robert craig and alexander charles.  kate:	and when were they born? morris:	4th of may. i can’t remember i got my book in there. kate:	how long you came here? morris:	well let’s see. where were we living, we were living in navajo street and we moved from there, that’s westside to the eastside and we lived in pennsylvania plains which was between second and third south, ninth and tenth east . and it was we just and our life there. kate:	we can get that later but now when you look back now on your life, you lived in two countries and you lived the first half of your adult life in england and you’ve lived here. you mentioned that you didn’t particularly like americans at the beginning. morris:	well no.  kate:	and, how did you view coming to this country culturally, from england to here, you didn’t suffer persecution as such in england. morris:	not really we had street meetings in england.  kate:	maybe because of your faith. morris:	yes. and i was already a mormon when i married alec. latter day saint and when we came, we travelled by bus from new york to here to here, changed in chicago, got another bus to chicago. we went into one place and i was asked if i would like some root beer. i said, “i don’t drink root beer.” in england there’s- i can’t remember-- alex told you the beer. kate:	ginger beer. morris:	no, root beer.  kate:	yes. morris:	but he just said beer you see [inaudible 00:49:56] back in england. kate:	so when you look back now, how do you feel about your original decision to come here? morris:	we promised each other that we would go through a temple as soon as we could and salt lake was the nearest temple to us except for switzerland, i didn’t want to go to switzerland. we are quite happy to be here. kate:	and have you adjusted to life here? morris:	oh yes. kate:	would you think of going back ever? morris:	we go back on visits but not to stay. kate:	well, i’d like to thank you on behalf of the ellis island oral history project and we’ll send you a copy as well. morris:	good. kate:	this is july, 1994 in salt lake city utah for the ellis island oral history project.
