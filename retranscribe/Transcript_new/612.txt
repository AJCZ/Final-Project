i had always raised the hand because the other ones don’t have the guts to raise their hand.  janet:	they were afraid to say they didn’t understand. goulios:	yeah they didn’t understand all they said he said again and he used to call me professor. even i didn’t know but the other guys didn’t know either but count on me they learnt it too but he was very strict.  he used to say branch how do call them from the tree. so he used to say, “bring a branch,” and not matter whether you brought the branch or something, if you does something wrong he hits you or he gets you to stay there for one hour with your foot up. but he taught so good he was a professor and god bless him he was very nice. then afterwards another guy was much younger and used to take us for picnics out and he teaches good but he was more young and he liked to sing and he was a very good teacher. janet:	he wasn’t as strict as the first one. goulios:	no he was not. well he was strict but not as much because he was old maybe we would get on his blood. this guy was young, we used to go he was a good teacher and he had the only son this second teacher.  he lost that son because he was gone to gjirokaster because in high school or something like that or college and the three sons got drunk and he was to go home, the youngest son, and when i went back there i got married he used to like me a lot.  he invited me over and down he showed me his son’s grave and all that because i took him over to my house too. he’s very good but he died. he used to write me here i send him some money the only son i had and he was very good.  it was not a village but he came to our village, didn’t come every day he stayed there close by though. i went over, he had his son’s monument and grave and pictures and all that. he was very smart but he used to speak french too with his son. janet:	well you must have been a good student… goulios:	well very good yeah. yes very good, well i was quite and i want to confess my cousin was better than me but he was a little older. he was… janet:	were you in the same class with your cousin too?

 goulios:	yeah, good thing the school it was nearby and somebody took me up there registered me and they were so nice to me but the kids they make jokes at me, they told me i was from a foreigner land.  janet:	they made… goulios:	joke at me.  janet:	what looked like horns for green horn or something?  goulios:	no, they were something, they run around and but the teacher was so nice to me. like i said they were so strict and made me write 10 times each word and even after 60 years i teach my grandkids now, i know how to spell american people broadly and they don’t know how to spell.  english language is very difficult to you it may be nothing but to a foreigner it’s very hard because definitely there is no other language in my opinion that the way you pronounce it you don’t write it. then the other language you write it the way you pronounce you know.  janet:	so, was that the thing that was most helpful to you that you had to write it so many times with the teacher, is that what helped you learn?  goulios:	well no, i learned gradually but this is that, it got in my head that i will never forget the spelling of the words. that’s what i tell my grandchildren already, they go to school little too.  they are grown up, they work and they, i tell them go to school because if you don’t know how to write and how to read it’s no use because a lot of people don’t like it but then you can’t understand nothing.  janet:	so, in other words when you went to school the children sort of chased you and made fun of you but the teacher was fine?  goulios:	outside when there [unclear 00:42:11] time you know, for a few days because i was big, i went with six year old, seven years first class, i went to first class. i wasn’t so big but still 14 but the teacher was so nice to me, god bless him whoever.  janet:	so then, how long did you stay in school?  goulios:	well, i stayed a couple of years but i went to, because i knew my geographical, arithmetic, i knew everything only the language. i went up to sixth grade then i had to go to work because there was nobody working then i went to night school.  another thing is i went, my uncle was very, he wanted me to learn greek language too. so, i used to go from my american school in the evening i go to greek school because a lot of greeks in chicago, half a million they got about 15 churches and i used to go that’s where i learnt the greek language, he was a nice priest.  janet:	this is your uncle from istanbul or from… goulios:	yeah, istanbul but he was here, he was in chicago.  janet:	right from chicago?   goulios:	he died 102 years old1973 or somewhere there. he smoked three packs a day of cigarettes, didn’t bother him, no cancer no nothing. but i don’t know if it bother me, i don’t smoke but i suffer i don’t, can’t see, i got a lot of problems.  janet:	what was your first job when you came to america?  goulios:	first job i went to some greek fellows because i learnt little greek first i was aha, this is good. there was two cousins and they had 24 hours open so i went there to wash dishes, but i used to work from 7 like morning to 7, 12 hours. in the evening you know they got a law there that women can’t work no more than 10 hours, you want me to tell you that?  so, one day, there was two cousins, one was very nice the other one was a little more brutal. so, i go there in the morning i go before time like the system i go drink a cup of coffee and go to work. ooh, it was full, the kitchen with dishes because that woman left it, she used to work from 8:00 o’clock in the evening to 6:00 in the morning, it was 24 hours open.  she leaves at 6:00 where there is not too much work and night time but in the morning when i go at 7:00 everybody go for breakfast there. so, i drink my coffee and were almost done, in the evening the same different. i used to go eat before 12 hours, eat a little bit before i leave.  when i eat a little they had no place where to put the dish i go back there. i used to wait until this woman come otherwise you can’t that’s a lunch and then dinner hour, oh my god! so, i stayed there but that his cousin was very nice.  after a while i think he let me go to school a few hours so, and eat everything. the other guy the worse and all, his relative one guy like me, his name was vasi. he was a funny, not funny but he was old man but he had no teeth and they had, they buy these pies, caster pies what have you.  you got to have logic that he buy the pies for the customers, well you could got plenty but he was like, if he had one there yes. but then he couldn’t say because his relatives at one time he says, “you kind of like this,” but he said, ‘yeah,” i never forget that.  he told no to eat probably because it was for the customers. so, he looked at him he didn’t comment, then he look at me i couldn’t eat you know. so, the other guy was very nice and afterwards i went to school. what else did i do, i stayed there quite a while.  janet:	at the restaurant?  goulios:	at the restaurant but i learn more on the language and like a waiter then i got to another restaurant and i worked there too. but then after a while, those relatives both greeks and he told me he opened another restaurant he said, “come by me up there,” i was like a manager there, a little place.  he had this cousin or something work with me and him. i used to close the store, give me the kids, but i had to go there 10:30 in the morning and until 2:00. then go back at 6:00 and close the store and it was miserable because you are always working, never have a little time. only had sundays to go, i didn’t got no time and he used to cook himself, he was a nice man though.  janet:	this was in chicago too?  goulios:	in chicago yeah.  janet:	remember the name of the restaurant?  goulios:	yeah, it was, he used to make his like a mix of chilly, chilly parlor they call him but he had other stuff too and he made, but he made good chilly with peppers and all of that, they used to eat a lot of it up there.  janet:	you didn’t have a, did the restaurant have a greek name or you don’t know what that is?  goulios:	no, chilly parlor they call it, it was on 26 [unclear 00:48:08] the place and right next to the corner, corner of a cigar store next was the store. i stayed there quite a while.  janet:	do you know long, when was it that you went back to albania?  goulios:	well, i went back to albania in 1938 i got married because i got sick and i went there and then i got married.  janet:	so, you got sick here in chicago?  goulios:	yeah, it was there.  janet:	then you, so when you were sick you went back to albania?  goulios:	i went back to albania because my mother was there.  janet:	so, when you got sick, you wanted to go back?   goulios:	yeah, well that’s right, i used to spit blood or something, i don’t know and i went to athens i got some shots or something. then i got well and i got married.  janet:	well, did you know this person that you married before you went back there?  goulios:	yeah, she’s from the village, my wife is syrian see, she is from the village but it’s a big story because my father liked her she was nice looking too but my father was there, he went to albania see, and he did some kind of business like lime or something and somebody want to, he was doing, he sold the stuff, he sold lime, you know lime?  janet:	yeah.  goulios:	he made the lime and they sold it, and he told him about my mother-in-law now that he wants some but she didn’t, her husband like my wife’s, my father-in-law was up here but didn’t send enough money. my father said well you find her because they know if you got money they send money or not they are going to let us.  so, my wife was there at that time and he told, he didn’t recognize her because from young she grow in her upper village like i told you before. he said well you find her you know and she was there because he was afraid that he won’t let credit and she won’t pay.  so, my wife was there and she told him that we got the money we find it get it for you because you couldn’t get that time from any place and boy, he made a mistake and she got to tell him because i didn’t want to spoil my, she was a beautiful woman though and i got married with her, this is a joke.  janet:	so, what was the wedding like? did you have a real wedding?  goulios:	yeah, we had a big wedding yeah, that’s right. we, you like we bring the bride in a horse because it’s a rough road. well, now they got cars too, you know the car and they fix it up a little better, but those days there were only with horses or mules or something like that, or horses mostly. they fixed the bride in a horse.  janet:	she was dressed in like a wedding gown?  goulios:	yeah, well they got different custom there and they have some kind of oriental or something, but they are very expensive. i don’t know whether they are, that’s not the rule they borrowed or something. beautiful with gold or something you know trimmed.  i don’t know if you’ve seen in the antics they are used. now they are used here all the gowns and so forth. so, you go there you pick the, well the bride with a group and you bring her down and somebody say they want to bring down they have to pay money to get her off the horse and you have to.  janet:	who has to pay?  goulios:	well, whoever wants, they go i give 500, or 600 who pays more this is proven the further they are bringing on. then after a while she is covered up.  janet:	she has a veil over her face?   goulios:	well, [unclear 00:52:29]. janet:	well, you have to pay again?  goulios:	yeah.  janet:	wow.  goulios:	so, but we had a nice house at that time but after a while it burnt down you know. after during the war and we are all, my wife suffered a lot you should my wife mob the house. now she screws this, she was a couple of times in jail trying to run away.  janet:	how long did you stay there when you were [unclear 00:52:57]?  goulios:	well, that is about six month, ten months or something like that, six months we were quite well married you know. now i think i stay a little more because i went to greece like i said i was sick and i got some and my father has some money in athens but they won’t give it to me.  all the money i gave to my father and he told me, give me permission to get this money but they won’t give it to me from albania they won’t let the money go out. i said stay there quite a while, while i was treated getting some shots. then i come back, when i come back my father had to, he told me he’s going to bring his money.  they had no bank in albania at that time, so the only bank was in greece that time. but i didn’t bring nothing, they won’t give me money just for one week next week come and get some more and those money went for nothing. now they change your money i wouldn’t ask, it’s gone see it’s a shame the way they do things.  janet:	well now, did you ever know what you had? what was the sickness that you had?  goulios:	i don’t know, i got well with climate or something i don’t know. maybe jimmy, answer.  janet:	well, we’ll stop here. oh i guess he got it down stairs okay. so, then after six, seven, eight months whatever.  goulios:	at that time.  janet:	you came back here and your wife came back with you?  goulios:	no.  janet:	she stayed there?  goulios:	she stayed.  janet:	that’s how she got into trouble?  goulios:	yeah, well she stayed there then 1939 i left, the war started, italy came there, i had a hell of a time to get here because i had a modern passport, me and another fellow. we came together to america they won’t let you go with the war, italy went to albania.  i stayed a few, how long about a month with them. they both so much charming back and forth, they did travel. then the second world war started and i’m telling you i had the most miserable life in all humanity, without no family, without my wife where is she at, she suffered more. that’s where you go write a book.  janet:	yeah, so in the meantime you came back here and then you wife gave birth to your son?  goulios:	that’s right.  janet:	immediately after?  goulios:	she was only six months pregnant and she didn’t get pregnant right away.  janet:	yeah, what is your wife’s name?  goulios:	fania, f-a-n-i-a, fania.  janet:	what was her maiden name?  goulios:	veneti.  janet:	can you spell that one?  goulios:	yeah, v-e-n-e-t-i.  janet:	and your son’s name?  goulios:	tanas.  janet:	okay and you grandchildren name?  goulios:	yes, i have philip and yonola, eleanor.  janet:	well, how do you think it affected you the fact that you started out in albania and lived there for 14 years and then you came here and went back and got married okay? how do you think the fact that you immigrated to this country affected the kind of person you have been and the person you are.  goulios:	well, i’ll tell you the person i am i have been here 65, 70 years no, yeah something like that i’ve never been in a police station, i’ve never had no problem with anybody, but i’m my own business and i worked. maybe i pay because i had a car ticket or something like that, but never had no problem in my life.  janet:	how is this time in your life, this time of old age?  goulios:	well, like i told you i worked for, when i come back from europe, when i got married i went and met my father-in-law here. from there after a month or so he passed away and it was 1941 evidently. so, they notified me, he had a sister of him this concord and then they notify them and they send me a telegram and i went inside bollington for a month.  chicago they don’t bury nobody in sunday’s and i was there may be waiting for the bus to go through. if i knew that they are going to bury her i didn’t get a text or something but i didn’t know that. so, i waited in bollington and he was living saint albert for a month near boarder with canada.  because when i came like i told you, i visit him and there was a greek fellow there a store and i managed too. so, when i, when they notify me i come to bury my father-in-law but when i arrived there sunday evening they already buried him and they left, you know his sister and her sons or something, whoever got up there.  so, soon i got off the bus, i went to that greek fellow was main street in a small town. so, i said “when do they have those the funeral?” he said, they buried and they left,” because he had, he was living, he had a little store there fixing, cleaning heads or shine, or something shoe shine. he lived in the back and probably he died two, three days before so they were forced to bury him.  janet:	so, this was in saint albert?  goulios:	saint albert, vermont. so, then i come back and i when his sister was not here, was in connecticut, touring to 1941, a lot of people where there because they were preparing for a war but it didn’t, i think december start the war.  so, in december when japan hit. so, i went to find out what happened by his sister, my wife’s aunt. so, i went there and they [unclear 00:59:14] torrington, connecticut.  so, i went there and like i told you i was manager of some restaurant up there. but i used to work every sunday, everyday almost all the evening, everything. so, then they i think united states got in the war that time, i don’t remember exactly was in or not.  janet:	wait let me just pause here for a second. starting this again to say that this is the end of tape one.  goulios:	tape two.  janet:	i’m going to start tape two, i’m speaking with goulios goulios and we will begin tape two and finish the interview there.  goulios:	yeah.  janet:	okay.  goulios:	how did you get in contact with jimmy?  janet:	this is the beginning of tape two and i got in contact with jimmy papous through caise gilianas, he has the bakery in manchester.  goulios:	okay.  janet:	okay so, used to go there so you were saying about how you came to bury your father-in-law and he had already been buried when you got to saint albert’s, vermont.  goulios:	that’s right, then i went to touring to connecticut to meet his sister that she was at the funeral, my father-in-law sister and the rest of them. so, i went there, and at that time in 1941, is it on now?  janet:	yes.  goulios:	so, up there they used to hire everybody for during the war you know, during the japan attack united states. so, i was a young man, and they are hiring a lot of people and then they told me why don’t you stay here to learn the trade and all that?  but they like the rest of them, they didn’t have a school or anything, they put them in paints and all that. but god bless he was a friend of mine up there, he was a lathe hand but he knew from detroit you know what a lathe is, it’s a machine.  janet:	a lathe?  goulios:	lathe yeah. so, i told them i’m going to go, they are going to put me in a paint to try out see how they, she said “what do you mean?” paid and i was a young man that time, 24 or 26 something like that, 24 i think. so, he went down stairs with me, with the employment manager.  he told me because he knew i had school, i know language good and writing and like i told you so he went there and then they train me to learn how to run the lathe i stayed but, 10 months in lathe hand. of course in the beginning i do all kind of jobs but i have instructor that show me a little bit and then maybe somebody finish up because that’s with millimeter very fine.  so, i stayed 10 months and then my father and uncle was in chicago. they complain about me left them old people in this, but then they call me for the army i had to go. so, i left the job but that helped me a lot because you used to go in chicago used to ask for job and you know what can you do, what kind of traits you got? so, i told like i have lathe, i have a point.  janet:	are you saying lathe hand?  goulios:	lathe, they run a machine.  janet:	lathe?  goulios:	lathe l-a-t-h, you know lathe hand, that guy that run the machine. then the point that i want, they didn’t need nobody because it was for maintenance work, they had only one or two old people. but they told me if you want to, if i want to learn should be in every work it’s for maintenance.  you know what a maintenance you keep up it was a big plant 10,000 people. so, i went there and i got that job as a mechanic helper not as an instructor or something and i used to go to night school, high school mainly for sketches, drawings and all that. i stayed there like i told you 18 years but after three, four years and gradually i used to do work myself. i used to well, i used to figure out things.  janet:	what’s with the going in the army that helped? goulios:	well, going in the army they, we went for examination then in core course. but if you missed one day so, a friend of mine we are from the same neighborhood, we went but you change your jobs at that time, you had a lot of jobs defense you know, he changed and they took him.  after we went they reject us first time, they didn’t take us they come call us later. so, i was working but i was told that if you miss one day from work, the next day you get telegraph from the president and write you not to force you to go for your country.  so, i worked up there until this friend of mine that time you know they train you one week and they send you to france and they got killed. so, i worked up there until, during the war i didn’t make too much money but i was learning the trade and i was going to school, at night school.  that’s why i got injured up there, i fell off six yards down i was on cast from here to here and my broken foot and a cast. i had heavy work, and now after 18 years they want to give me no pension, the union shut. but they close up 1959, ’60 they close up the plant and i, you stay a three, four weeks’ vacation that’s i used to come out here because i had a lot of relatives out here.  janet:	so, you are going to talk with someone about seeing about getting your pension?  goulios:	yeah, half of whatever is coming to me, i’m not asking for it for nothing you know. but if you read the letter you could understand.  janet:	yeah, but just let’s finish this up right.  goulios:	yeah.  janet:	let me just ask you a final question. how do you feel about having made the decision to come here?  goulios:	well, i like it very much you know it’s, america it’s a good country but you got to work. if you are working like i told you i worked 65 years and i never been in the police station here for anything.  janet:	do you think america is like a melting pot?  goulios:	well, definitely it’s a melting pot but, the thing is that to my opinion nowadays they spoil the people with tv and with all killing and all guns and all that, and the all sex and all that. i don’t believe in that, i don’t know maybe i’m wrong.  janet:	okay.  goulios:	i’m in no authority to judge but i’m just saying.  janet:	you are saying your opinion.  goulios:	yeah.  janet:	well, is there anything else that you would like to say before we close? anything?  goulios:	well, god bless america, i wish my family to be good like me or better because i didn’t accomplish, i had a home in chicago, i had a good job and everything, but i had to leave because the plant closed. i went i got different jobs, they, i don’t know there was a big plant but nowadays i don’t know.  they still, armory company is a big company, they still have armory men but if they see somebody else about was 3,000 people in general off i used to go there for air condition and all of the repair jobs.  janet:	well tell me this, what makes you feel most satisfied that you’ve done in your life? what makes you feel good?  goulios:	well, in my life i did all i could and it was bad that i suffer my life because it was not america’s fault, it was communists fault you know that i was separated from my wife and my wife see. i love america and i hope my family enjoy the country and be prosperous, the work, they work two jobs.  i tell them now go to school, i tell them go to school because without school you can’t gain nothing especially when you don’t have nobody, nobody can help you unless you help yourself.  janet:	okay, well i think that’s a good note to end that one. i want to thank you very much.  goulios:	okay.  janet:	very interesting interview and i’ve been speaking with goulios goulios here in concord.    goulios:	in new hampshire [unclear 01:08:27]. janet:	new hampshire and its october 31st 1995. mr. goulios is 81 at the time of this interview.  goulios:	almost.  janet:	just had a surgery right?
