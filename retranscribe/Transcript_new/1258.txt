had you ever seen him? pandalis: 	my mother and dad were married here in this country.  man: 		she was born here.  kate: 	you were born here, that's right.  pandalis: 	the only reason i went to finland was to see the doctor.  kate: 	okay, that's right. i had- theresa is looking at me here. so your father came here first and then your mother came here. now you told me a story about how your mother got here and what story, she gave you the story.  pandalis: 	yes, that was the story.  kate: 	why don't you tell it for us here?  pandalis: 	she had a cousin or somebody down here that wrote and told her that she had a chance to come down if she would marry this man because he was in jail.  kate: 	where was this now?

do you know? anemic?  pandalis: 	anemic, yes.  kate: 	you mentioned you were anemic. okay, so you were anemic and why couldn't doctors here take care of it?  pandalis: 	my mother took me to the doctor and he gave some kind of medicine or something and it didn't work.  kate: 	you mean here?  pandalis: 	yes. so my mother didn't have any faith in this doctor. she wanted to go to this doctor in helsinki because he was a good doctor, and he had been a doctor of the family for many years before.  kate: 	what was his name? do you know at all?  pandalis: 	i don't remember that.  kate: 	okay, you went all the way from michigan to finland again with your mother?  pandalis: 	yes.  kate: 	did she ever tell you about that trip?
