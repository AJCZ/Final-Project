harris:	he went to pittsburg. kate:	to do what? harris:	to mine, to mine coal, work in the mines. kate:	do you know who his contact was in this country? harris:	no, i sure don’t know. i wonder sometimes if it was john murrack because he was their banker, because they didn’t know their money, these men that came. my dad used to say, “i know i was cheated but what could i do?” kate:	he went to pittsburg and he had an american banker. harris:	no. john murrack was the banker. he just took their money and said he’s going to put it in the bank for them but they didn’t have what they thought they should have had. kate:	did your father speak any english before he came? harris:	no. kate:	did your mother speak any english? harris:	no. kate:	he came for a year to pittsburg. what happened after that? tell me how- harris:	john yusick came with him. the two of them came together. they knew each other back there. they were buddies here. i don’t know … they met john murrack and he told them, “i’ll be your banker.” they give their whole pay check or keep some, whatever they needed maybe. i don’t know. then when they got enough money to send for us then we came. kate:	did your mother talk about leaving, anything? how she felt about leaving home? did she want to come to the united states? harris:	sure, she did. she wanted to be with my dad. my grandmother i guess she got attached to me and she begged him to leave me there. then later on, if anything happened to her then they could send for me. my dad says, “no,” to bring them both. kate:	your brother was alive then? harris:	yeah. he was a year old when he came.  kate:	your mother came with two little ones? harris:	me and brother. kate:	frank. harris:	no, he was harry. kate:	harry was older. you and harry came on the boat with her. harris:	yeah. kate:	did she talk about getting ready to leave at all? ever tell you any stories about leaving home? harris:	it did break her heart to leave because she hated to leave her folks back there. she had two brothers. they were in 1918 war, both lost their lives. my dad’s brother, he had to go into the service and he was killed but it was just lately that i found out that he was married and had a son. i’ll show the pictures of him. i’ve got pictures of him. he wrote me this letter and i wish i could have it americanized, but i don’t know where to go from here. kate:	you can’t have people here put it in english. harris:	that’s what i want. kate:	you can’t have somebody in the community here like harris, or fred, or somebody translate it for you. harris:	i don’t know if fred could do it. i could ask him maybe because i see him all the time. kate:	you came with your mom and with harry. did your mom say it broke her heart because she was leaving behind her family? harris:	yeah. kate:	did she talk about the voyage though? what it was like? harris:	we came steerage. she said that they brought food. she thought it was what was left from on top of the boat from the elite people maybe. kate:	leftover food. harris:	that’s what she thinks it was. she thought it could have been because a lot of times it wasn’t meat. it was just vegetables and potatoes, but we made it i guess. i guess it was- kate:	did she mention of being voyage condition like what the seas were? did she say anything about being-? harris:	yeah, seasick. kate:	she was seasick. she [crosstalk 00:13:42] harris:	she was seasick and she counted the days on her fingers i guess when she left. kate:	did she bring with her anything? did she take with her anything that was valuable? harris:	trunks. she had trunks. i still have one here. kate:	what did she put in those trunks? do you know? harris:	she put scarves, some lines, and clothing mostly i guess. i don’t know. kate:	do you have anything left from the family now? do you have a bible or any religious artifacts? no, just the trunk itself. harris:	i did have a rosary of hers. kate:	that she brought with her. harris:	i don’t know if i have that yet or not. i think i do but it’s in slovenian, but it’s just to keeps sake. kate:	what was your mother bound for? where were you three of you going to at that point when you came off the boat? harris:	we were detained there for customs for two or three days. kate:	did your mother ever talk about ellis island? harris:	just an island and she remembers seeing the statue of liberty. she said that everybody hollered, were so glad that we were here, got here. kate:	but then she got into ellis island and she was detained, for what reason? harris:	we had to have shots and everything before we could go into new york, but i don’t know what boat we came on. i noticed some of them have mentioned the boat that they sailed here. then she was standing in line there like i seen on tv. that’s the way maybe we looked too.  a fellow went down with the [inaudible 00:15:51] and on an impulse she run out there and lifted her apron up and start filling her apron with oranges. the man finally made her understand that she’s got to pay for it. she just dropped that apron and the oranges, run down the incline and the man after the retrieving. i thought that was cute. kate:	did she mention the inability to speak english was a problem at all? harris:	later on, for years after, i think in the late 20s she tried to … because all the ladies she associated with spoke their slovenian language. kate:	you were detained in ellis island. did they feed you? did she say anything about how you- harris:	she never said, but i know she was hungry because she run out for these oranges. kate:	did anybody come to the boat to get you? how did you get-? harris:	we must have run on a … what kind of boat did they take you to new york harbor? i don’t know. just so many people or try to keep the families together. kate:	you were bound from what city then by train? harris:	no. i don’t know how we got to philadelphia. kate:	you went to philadelphia? harris:	mm-hmm. kate:	then what happened? harris:	we went into a building, she said. it was i don’t know how many stories and i don’t know whether she had to climb stairs or did they have elevators? i don’t know. when we got up to the room where my dad batched, lived, the windows were facing another building that was really close together so she couldn’t see. she said, she swears we were up over top of the smoke stacks, high up there. kate:	what was your father doing in philadelphia then? harris:	he was working in the mines. kate:	but pittsburg and philadelphia are kind of far. harris:	isn’t pittsburg in philadelphia? kate:	no, they are two different cities. harris:	is it? kate:	yeah. harris:	how stupid of me. kate:	no, that’s okay. you think it was … harris:	pittsburg. kate:	pittsburg was the name of the town. it was in pittsburg. he lived and he had his own little room in [crosstalk 00:18:32]. harris:	i guess he waited till we had more money to come into wyoming. kate:	what age did you … you were so young. do you remember any of this time at all in pittsburg? harris:	no, i don’t remember anything about pittsburg. i don’t remember anything about reliance. kate:	that’s where you came to. harris:	yes. we came to reliance and she said there were two three houses and some places, dug in places where people lived and tents. she said no trees, no nothing. the water was hardened. she said, “and the sand, the wind blew terrible up there.” kate:	your father then went from pittsburg, took the family out to reliance, wyoming. harris:	uh-huh. kate:	because he was going to work where. harris:	he worked in the reliance mines. kate:	in the reliance mines. where did you leave then in reliance? did you have a house? harris:	i don’t know how we lived there. i don’t know. i know in the fall … i don’t know what year, if we were out there a whole year or not, but in the fall we went to grace creek, utah. kate:	for what reason? harris:	to work in the mines. kate:	you moved from reliance to grass creek, utah. harris:	we were there all winter. we were snowed in. mama said that the snow must have been like five, six feet, and my dad had to shovel a path into the outhouse and the cool house. maybe somebody had to deliver groceries. we had no car, nothing. somebody bought us groceries. kate:	what’s your first memory yourself without your mother telling you? what do you remember first? harris:	the first thing i remember is going to grass creek. i don’t remember the train ride but i do remember the sleigh ride from the depot to the house where we were going to live. i remember that. kate:	you went by sleigh ride and it was pulled by what? harris:	her horses. because it was cold i remember and they’d give us a robe and we covered up with the robe. kate:	how old could you have been then? harris:	i must have been four. kate:	was frank born yet? harris:	no, just harry and i were there. i don’t know how she entertained us but she said that she did roll … throw a rug and wrapped it up and that was my doll. she said there is a stray kitten that i was crazy about. she let the kitten stay with us. kate:	do you remember the house in grass creek. harris:	uh-huh. i just remember we couldn’t see out of the windows because of the snow. it was covered up. kate:	from there, where did you go? harris:	we stayed there till that spring and mama said she can’t take another winter there, so we’d come back to reliance. that’s where i started school. kate:	how did your mom react to these moves every time? harris:	she cried. i don’t know how many times she cried day and night. my dad really was disgusted with her i think. kate:	was she ever homesick? harris:	yes, she wanted to go home. kate:	did your father want to go home? harris:	no, he said, “you’re stuck here now.” he said, “you got to stay. no money,” he says, “to send you back.” they argued. she said what would she do if … how could she exist there or something? kate:	where? back home? harris:	yeah. in yugoslavia, in skofaloka. kate:	is there any point where she got used to life here, your mother? harris:	yeah. see years after we moved to blairtown from reliance, we went to gunn. kate:	what years were that?

harris:	slovenian. kate:	did you know any english before you went to school? harris:	no. kate:	at school, were there other kids in the same boat as you? harris:	yes. we all spoke slovenian every one of us. kate:	in reliance. how big was the school in reliance? do you remember? harris:	i don’t know that either. kate:	all right. do you remember learning english? harris:	not that year that i started school. i had a friend, fanny kovach that took me back and forth. i do remember when we had recess we went out. i was told this after. i didn’t know at the time. i went home. i thought school was out. kate:	did anyone ever call you any names for being slovenian as a child, any bad names? harris:	if they did, i didn’t know they were calling me names. kate:	later in life, did anybody ever- harris:	then fanny starts telling me a few words. i kind of remembered those or grasped them. kate:	do you remember the first words were? harris:	no, i don’t know. kate:	how about religious life in this country? did your parents go to church? harris:	my mother did but not my dad. i had to go. when we lived here in blur town, we went to catechism and father shifler was the priest. kate:	did father shifler help your family come to the united states at all?

were teachers nice to you there? harris:	i didn’t know how to tell them when nature called. my sister, fanny, she said, “there’s got to be some way that she should understand … the teacher could understand that i had to live.” she told fanny … she said for me to raise my hand and if she went this way, i can’t go. i wet myself a lot, but it didn’t take long for me to … when fanny told her that i needed help that way. kate:	how did fanny know english? harris:	they lived here before. they were one of the- kate:	you didn’t go to the bathroom because you didn’t know how to tell the teacher. harris:	yeah. i couldn’t tell her. mama says, “there is got to be a way that we could communicate.” fanny told as to how and she says, “well, just tell her to raise her hand. put her elbow on the table.” she said, “raise her hand.” if she says that i can go well then i’d get up and go but i came back. the first recess we had i thought that was over with, school was over and i went home. isn’t that awful? kate:	no. were your parent’s friends with … you said social with other slovenians. harris:	mm-hmm. kate:	did you have non slovenian friends? harris:	i don’t know that. kate:	what did your parents speak to each other? harris:	they spoke slovenian. kate:	did they switch to american. harris:	my dad decided he would americanize all of us. go to … what is it? he had to go to green river i know. there must have been an interpreter there to tell him what to study or- kate:	for citizenship. harris:	yeah, for citizenship and that was in ’24, 1924. i remember that.  kate:	when did your mother’s attitude sort of change? you said she cried day and night a lot and she wanted to go home. harris:	she cried when we got to ellis island because she didn’t see my dad in no place. she didn’t know that … i don’t what she thought or where she was going from ellis island, but she thought my dad should have been there. then when we got to pittsburg she cried to leave in that apartment house or whatever it was. she couldn’t see nothing.  all she’d seen was the smoke stacks. it was a dirty place. she said it had … it smelled bad too i guess. when we moved to reliance, she cried. when we went to grace creek, utah, it was in the fall and it was still a little bit green. she liked it there but not the way that it snowed. we went back to reliance. she said she cried again. oh dear, my dad said something about her crying all the time. he said, “you’re just going to have to stop it.” kate:	how did it affect you as a child at all? harris:	it didn’t bother me. i didn’t know any better. i was just with them. kate:	now tell me where you finally settled down. was it in blair? harris:	in blairtown. kate:	blairtown. where is that in relation to rock springs? harris:	it’s west of town. kate:	what was that like there? what house did you live in? harris:	that was nice for me. i liked it because i could talk american then. can you believe it? i lost the language. kate:	you lost slovenian?
