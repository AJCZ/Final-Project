honigman:  	no, i never worked for my father. janet: 	you never did? honigman:  	never did. the fact that my father became a worker in later years and that’s it.  janet: 	so, what was your philosophy behind becoming so active? honigman:  	poverty.  janet: 	in the union.  honigman:  	that people should live better, that people need organization, that people need kindness and they needed leadership and this is the reason. i always had a lot of compassion for people, to me it’s feeling that you are born with you know that’s it what can i tell you.  i couldn’t eat if i would see you hungry. i had an experience once with my wife, but we didn’t have a job, we were both regularly discriminated and we walked from sim-sim street downtown, we didn’t have no café but we had a dime we went there and we bought, we ordered a sandwich. we put it on the table and as we went for the coffee a man sat down and he ate it.  so, we gave them the coffee, that’s the experience and the only reason i came was because eleanor told me, it will do you good and i wanted to spread, you got to be human, it doesn’t always work out but you try. this is the, part of my life and so was my son and my daughter.  janet: 	tell me your children’s names for the… honigman:  	barbra, his son, you want my grandchildren? janet: 	how many do you have? honigman:  	i have a great granddaughter married already.  janet: 	so, you have great grandchildren? honigman:  	julie, jane. this one graduated now, he is working in texas and her husband is taking the board examination. they are quite successful, not rich, poor that’s it. janet: 	what do you think, what kind of impact do you think it had on you as a person to have. honigman:  	to what? janet: 	what kind of an impact do you think it had on you as a person, to have been born in russia and then in romania and to have come here after the first world war as an immigrant to this country. honigman:  well, i thought to myself i was lucky that i got out there, that we could do things for people. i mean i’m talking about myself and it’s all that i can tell you. we did things to, we did things the best to our ability that’s all i could tell you.  janet: 	what are you most proud of having done?  honigman:  	huh? janet: 	what do you feel most proud of having done? honigman:  that i married my wife and i had beautiful children, and when i did i didn’t make any money, i didn’t look for it, i did it because i believed in it. some of it was good and some of it was not, you’ve seen what happens all over the world.  you’ve seen what happened in russia or this is, i know you are jewish what happened in [unclear 00:40:43], what happened in austria, when they build a cross in our streets, six and a half million jews were killed. that hurts me.  where you take such beautiful people, and yeah really i mean you know, i don’t have to not find to, make the jews outstand, of course there are some bad but in general they were fine, since there was a, i want this to go on tape even on 13th that showed you the, the worcester ghetto, nothing. we don’t care he didn’t come, or they built a church in auschwitz, that hurts me.  because we gave our blood, that killed our six and a half million human beings. that bothers me, and i say to myself, “hey what did you fight for?” you know what i’m talking about, and that’s what hurts me today, see. so, then i say to myself once it was worth it what i did, who knows, it seems the world don’t we don’t protest and i think it’s something and i can go to church when they, not i’m against the church but i know they were jews they were killed. and i don’t know whether that is good or not, to tell it to you, but that’s how i feel about it.  janet: 	when you say you were fighting, you mean in the union fighting for the economy.  honigman:  but in life for the workers that’s all. they should live, they should be able to bring up their children properly which i did for me, and i believe everybody should do it for themselves that’s it. janet: 	do you feel that you have any, customs or ways that you are that stand from your roots in eastern europe, do you think you carry certain qualities for the resettlement.  honigman:  	well the only thing that you carry is poverty.  janet: 	poverty? honigman:  	that i know when i was hungry i know the other people were hungry too, and this is what made me do a lot of things, until this day. that i can’t make myself do things which i know others can do, to give you an idea my wife is as five years almost. i can’t make myself go for vacation.  janet: 	mmh.  honigman:  	you know it’s hard to even explain it’s how you feel about it, that’s it.  janet: 	well, how is this time in your life, in your old aged time, what was it like for you? honigman:  	well, i live i have a beautiful son, i have a beautiful daughter, she is a beautiful woman this eleanor, i know through father. i didn’t know our father, our mother lives in my house.  janet: 	this is eleanor [unclear 00:44:18], who is here with you? honigman:  	yeah, our father was a professor in brookline college that’s all i know, nice expression, i mean a lot of compassion and feeling to work hard i mean you know, and that’s about it.  janet: 	do you feel there are certain things, maybe you said them already, but that you feel that you want to hand down? honigman:  	if could, i would. janet: 	it’s important to pass along.  honigman:  	i speak to my son, he is alive, i talk to my daughter but as long as you live, you should live like a human being and leave your inheritance that you have somebody to look up to, it’s for your own good. when i do this thing not because of me, it’s for them, and i have the same for your feeling because you don’t know this for the managers, you do it because you believe in it, and that’s it.  janet: 	okay, well now how do you feel about coming back to ellis island, after 70 years.  honigman:  	well, it’s an experience, it’s a lot of remembrance your mother, your brother that’s gone, your sister that’s gone, and look family you know et cetera. i frankly she told me she made an appointment with you, i wouldn’t have come though, because it’s hard. i see my mother, anxious to see my father, you know my brothers that’s it.  janet: 	well, i’m very happy that you did come.  honigman:  	well i’m happy, i’m glad you are a nice person.  janet: 	it’s been a pleasure talking with you, and this tape will now be on file for posterity you will have a copy and i thank you very much.  honigman:  	i thank you, and i thank you for your time.  janet: 	you are very welcome.  honigman:  	you are a nice person, and i believe you will do your work, is because i did my work. you do not do it for the money, you do it because it’s history and i believe it’s important and that’s why i came here.  janet: 	wonderful, thank you. this is janet levine for the park service, i have been speaking with abraham honigman on february 5th 1995 and i’m signing off.
