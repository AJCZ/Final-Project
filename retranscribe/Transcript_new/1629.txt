i used to like to dance. they told me. so i finally find it. i go along the walk off to see a [unclear 00:47:50] somebody yell, yaaay! remo remo. i say what the hell.  it was the leader of this orchestra. he said, “it’s me, where you gone" said that "i am looking for you' come here come here. so i went there, somebody that he knew was staying there, said i have to go get a room someplace for sleep for tonight. he said, “you don’t have to go and get a room, i got room with two beds in it.” said i paid them already, “you can use one bed i use the other.” that all i said, “okay.” that night we meet a girl who came to the dance, start dancing begin to like her and i ask her “do you have a boyfriend?" she said, “no,” said, “i would go out with some boy sometimes but i don’t have no steady one.” she said, “why?” i said, “nothing i just would like to know.”  so instead of going home that night i stayed there till monday and i went there and got a job and i was living there. so next saturday she asked me-she came to the dance again because they used to dance every saturday night. and she says, “what you doing here?” i thought you was working higher? “i said yeah, but i like this place.” said, “what do you mean you like this place?” i said, “some girl that i like here.” well, “who is the girl?” i said, “you.” so i take her over the house to meet our people. three months later we were married. paul: 	how many children did you have?
