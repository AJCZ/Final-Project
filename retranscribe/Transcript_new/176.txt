 janet: 	today is november 1st, 1991. male: 	all day. janet: 	all day and i'm here in kokat new hampshire with mr. and mrs. boulgouras. mrs. boulgouras was born boulgourasanne christodoulou and she came from greece in 1926 when she was two years of age. today is november 1st, 1995 and this is janet levine for the national park service.  well i know you have an interesting story [laughter] even though you were very young at the time but i'm sure there's a lot of interest in this, so let me start at the beginning, where in greece were you born? boulgouras: 	kastania karditsa, a small village. janet: 	when you say kastania and what’s the other part? boulgouras: 	karditsa. janet: 	which is the same larger area as where your husband was when he was in greece? boulgouras: 	no, though it was near our larger area. janet: 	did you come from an area that was anywhere near in greece? boulgouras: 	almost near [laughter] but little did he know that one day he's going to marry the wife that was just born when he was nine years old [laughter]. male: 	and that you were the rebel. janet: 	a rebel? boulgouras: 	in west virginia yes. janet: 	you probably don't remember life in greece, so do you remember anything? boulgouras: 	it’s a very strange thing, i do remember things that happened to me in the village, i call it chorio in greek. they didn't have restrooms like that, you had to go outside no matter what time of day or night it was and i was always afraid because the village was up high, very high on a hill almost and although small, so young i was frightened because of the heavy wind and everything and i would just go and hide under my mother's skirt [laughter].  i remember that and just [inaudible 00:02:31] not too many things though but i was very interested when we were leaving. my parents told me this but after they told me i do remember we were going towards athens so they were [unclear 00:02:47] to come to america and every time i'd see a statue i would think of jesus christ because my grandfather had brought the property right next to the little house that we had there- my parents and so my grandfather bought the property to have a church built there and when it was built and everything. i remember jesus and you know the church was so beautiful and i'd say my prayers all the time and every time i see that. when we arrived in athens and i saw the statues there, my dad and mum you know were laughing, they got such a big kick out of it, i started to say my prayers [laughter].  i remember that and i also remember when were on the ship faintly though, i could see a lot of people and they have the ship you know makes the sound you know when you got on and ready to leave and my father was carrying me for a little while then he put me down and he was holding me by the hand and i don't know, he told me that i just took my hand away from his just for a second and this guy that i was talking to on the ship distracted him to the point where i left my father and there i went by myself running all over the ship there and it was the time when they were anchoring for people that were ready to come on the ship and my mother and father were petrified. they thought, "oh god, she must have- if she had or maybe she fell in the ocean or whatever [laughter]." but the truth is, this is the funny part, i always loved music so being such a young little girl you know i was surprised i could hear the sound of music and it was earlier in the morning when people hadn't gone to the dining room yet and my father say, "i lost my little girl, she has black hair, curly black hair and we have to find her."  so everyone on the ship was looking for me and here i am sitting at the [chuckle] this huge table all alone, just sitting like that and listening to the music and when my parents told me about it [laughter], i was laughing, i said, "well, there goes to prove that i really love," well i still do to this day, a lot of music and dancing and everything but it was funny how. janet: 	do you know if you came over on a greek ship? was it greek music do you think? boulgouras: 	it was greek music you're right, it could have been the olympia. i wish i could remember that [inaudible 00:06:14]. janet: 	i don't think you said your birth date for the tape too. boulgouras: 	the birth date, august the 3rd, 1924. janet: 	did you ever celebrate name days? boulgouras: 	yes, my mother they had a name day and my father, no he didn't have a name day. just my mother, her name was [unclear 00:06:39]. janet: 	what was her maiden name? your mother? boulgouras: 	lazarides. janet:	 can you spell that?  boulgouras:  	well, i can't say the name in english, lazarides l-a-z-a-r-i-d-e-s. janet: 	when you came to this country, you came with your mother? boulgouras: 	my mother and my father and now my sister were born in america, in west virginia. janet: 	i see, so you were the only child at that time. boulgouras: 	yes. janet: 	now, do you remember anything at all about the new york harbor, the statue of liberty, ellis island. boulgouras: 	i saw the statue of liberty but i just thought it was [unclear 00:07:22], say my prayers again [laughter]. i'm glad you reminded me but that’s about it but then in west virginia. janet: 	so why did the family go to west virginia? boulgouras: 	because my father first he came, he went to west virginia when he was 16 years old because his oldest brother had already left to go to west virginia because the coal mines and they were making a lot of money and my uncle who was older than my dad about maybe four years older and he wrote a letter saying, "i want you to come over, i need help and that way we can help our parents too."  they were five children and his father and mother, seven in all, so they were very poor and so my father said okay, "i'll come and help you," and he was only 16 but in 1921, the war was going on with the turks and the greeks you know it seems like that was forever and ever all the time so my father said, "i'm going to go over to greece and fight for my country."  so, he did, he went to greece and that’s how he met my mother. she was- i don't know how far away from my father's village, i don't think it was that far away. maybe a half an hour away or something, so he met my mother, she was the youngest of ten children that her parents had and i lost my grandfather when he was real young but my grandmother died 102 years old, god bless her and my mother just recently, five years now.  she passed away 96 and half years old, saying that they came from a strong healthy family, just my grandfather who passed away so young but they were five girls and five boys. my grandmother lost one son, so that left her nine after that but over there at the time when you have a big family too they didn't think that a girl should have to have a lot of education because that you'll get married, you'll have children.  in fact my mother used to say, "rosy, why you want to go?" well, i didn't listen, i said, "i need to go have some kind of education." but the sons they had to have their education and they would be either a doctor or lawyer, engineer things like that. that’s the kind of education they have over there, that’s why they have so many lawyers out you know from each family but she came from a big family. janet: 	what was your father's name? boulgouras: 	[unclear 00:10:38] which means al in short. my youngest son we named him after my father, my oldest son you saw the picture and he was named after my father in law. the first child they name him- this is different i mean people that don't understand. janet: 	this is a kind of a greek tradition, the naming? boulgouras: 	yes, and not only that, here if you say in america you want to name the child after the grandfather or the father you say junior, over there we don't have junior and senior. they want you to have the name of the grandfather first from his side of the family first then if i have another son, after my father.  so over there they say, that’s like my husband has his father's middle name constantine, so when they hear the socrates constantine boulgouras, they say, "i know that’s his father constantine. you see instead of saying senior or junior. janet: 	and it doesn't matter if the grandfather of the child is alive or not? boulgouras: 	no. janet: 	that doesn't matter? boulgouras: 	just that’s the tradition is that. janet: 	how about girls? is there any tradition about naming them? boulgouras: 	it’s kind of heard because how could say roseanne [unclear 00:12:16], it’s my father's name but you could say yes. that’s why rose and then ann consider like [unclear 00:12:27] which isn't the same thing but my daughter has my name, the middle name [unclear 00:12:36]. male: 	that’s a good german name. boulgouras: 	see, at that time queen federica was very high and reigning and 1954 when our daughter was born, his godfather said, "i know what i'm going to name her and i'm not going to say anything, it’s going to be like a queen, like a queen name." so he named her federica. janet: 	so now is it the grandfather's godfather role to name the child. boulgouras: 	yes, they're supposed to name the child. janet: 	but do the parents get to [crosstalk 00:13:25]? boulgouras: 	his godfather didn't want too. see his godfather baptized, his name was aristotelians memolis, okay there's a family here though, the memolis family but they're dead now. their godmother and godfather, so we didn't say anything, we let them but when my husband's godfather, he was his sister's godfather and he was the godfather of my oldest son, the godfather of my daughter but the youngest one was named after his godfather has passed now from [unclear 00:14:21].  they were from [unclear 00:14:23] at the time, now they live in [unclear 00:14:26] after that. they didn't have any children so they named him after my father because they knew my father better than his parents and they said, "no, well name this one al. i'll give you [unclear 00:14:41]? janet:	 so it was a surprise to you when the names were chosen? boulgouras: 	well, i expected it because i know that’s tradition you know that’s why. janet: 	i mean like federica, did you [unclear 00:14:54]? boulgouras: 	when he said queen, i hesitated a while but then i said well, yeah he said federica and i like the name it’s different. janet: 	are there any other greek traditions that people who came to this country continued to carry on? boulgouras: 	this is the difference between marriage of today. i mean them and marriage of today. you get married and of course you have a family and everything and i was raised like that that the husband is the king like what he says you should obey and everything.  well, i didn't agree with that because i was a little older after that. i mean of course respect and all that but it should be mutual, 50-50, i don't believe in 75 and 50 you know, no. it’s tough because my father was just like an angel. he was so good to my mom. i never grew up in a household where i had them even argue at all, it was so beautiful. my sister and i were very close and we loved each other and that’s what i wanted and that’s what i was looking for. janet: 	when your father took the family to west virginia, was he working in the coal mines again? boulgouras: 	no, my father never worked in the coal mines. the reason i mentioned coal, it was the richest coal mining town in west virginia and the miners that worked in the coal mines like that. my father and his brother of course, they had two restaurants.  we happened to be living up on a hill at that time in a big big house but as they decided why not have two restaurants, one for the miners you know they allowed gambling, horse racing tickets and things like that.  now, there was nothing strict about their laws about anything like that and if you go to west virginia and see these beautiful high mountains, if you go up to laconia, i would go through that area and i say, "oh god, this reminds so much of west virginia." the greenery and all that, i remember that all so vividly and it was so beautiful and [unclear 00:17:57], my father especially because he came to america when he was 16 and he said, "i didn't know a word of english like [inaudible 00:18:05]," but his brother had a chance of going to the world war 1. so he went to school, that’s another reason he wanted my father so he could have him work while he went to school to learn the english language and he probably had a little college education too. my father worked hard so he could help his family in greece, help to marry off his sisters because they were poor and over there they needed a dowry. janet: 	what would the dowry consist of in greece? boulgouras: 	money mostly, if you're going to be living in the village, they'll say, "i'll give you the horse or cow [laughter], whatever." male: 	[unclear 00:19:01]. boulgouras: 	just anything that i never liked that, i never never liked that because my father never asked anything from my mother, she was poor too but he loved her so that was most important and i said, "when i get married, if any guy comes here and asks for me because they want a dowry, out they go." he didn't ask either [laughter]. otherwise you would have been out of my life [laughter]. male: 	i suppose i had taken over your estate. boulgouras: 	i didn't have any estate, what estate did i have? you mean my father's estate? male:	 	no, my grandfathers. boulgouras: 	listen, never mind. you didn't ask for it and you weren't going to get it anyway [laughter]. male: 	i've been [inaudible 00:20:00]. janet: 	yeah [chuckle]. let’s see, you were saying that you were in west virginia and your father was helping his brother  boulgouras: 	and in the meantime he’d sent money to his sisters to marry them off and everything. that was hard time for the old people. janet: 	in west virginia, was there a large greek community? boulgouras: 	no, five families that’s all. this was interesting, my father used to say to me. when he had to come to america, he was sixteen years old, he didn't like i said within greece and they all had to when they were travelling they didn't know how to speak so they put a tag on him. you know on each of the guys that went to west virginia or wherever they were going, with their name on it. janet: 	you mean at ellis island they did that? boulgouras: 	yeah, just like stamping an animal or something and the direction where they were going to go, that was it and west virginia that time was more like this cowboys movies you see, the desert like thing like that. male: 	john wayne [laughter]. boulgouras: 	then you can see the mountains where they used to have indians and when i would go to the movies where on one side of the street there was pocahontas, they named the theater pocahontas. on the other side across street temple, so it was really mostly and indian reservation at the time and cowboys and everything, so it was tough for my dad because here they'd come in the restaurant and at that time before they built two others new restaurants.  they were coming in to have a drink or something and take a gun out. they’re talking and slamming on the counter. you know my father was petrified, he couldn't say too much you know and not only that we had a few colored people down there but they were very nice and they had a tough time but my father no matter what color they were, he felt sorry for them. "al, could you give me a jug. i need to [inaudible 00:22:45]?"  so my father because the law was not allowed to go in the restaurants at all, if they want to go have anything to drink or whatever, they'd have to go in the back of the kitchen, so my father felt bad you know but that was the law otherwise he would have been in trouble but he was nice to them they all liked him i remember that and they were always good to us too when i was growing up and going up to the high school.  they had their own section, the colored people and they had their own restaurants, they wore their homes and everything but the only difficulty was for me to go to my school which was a great school, they had it all up on the hill, the great school, the high school and the gymnasium right in the middle. i [inaudible 00:23:41] but the thing was the colored people would have to go up to the high school, would have to go a little ways into where the colored section was, they didn’t' harm us or anything but it’s the way they would stare at you and you know it was kind of frightening. i knew they weren't going to bother me because they knew my father too and everything but that was interesting and if you went on a bus, the colored people had to sit on the back. they had their own section for the poor people. i remember that because-- janet: 	the indians, were they discriminated against in any way? boulgouras: 	no, not at all because they all felt sorry for the colored people too you know and that [unclear 00:24:44], they say, "hello, how are you?"  janet: 	did the town remind you or your mother and father of the village in greece at all? boulgouras: 	oh yes, a little bit not that. well, because it was a small city but as i was growing up and it became larger and larger though wasn't that large, 10,000 population, they had beautiful stores and it was a boom town, it was really something else especially when our own people had to go to the service and i graduated in 1942 and so i remember 1941, they were enlisting them you know the minute they graduated and i'll never forget his name, john landberry, he died the minute he went to the service. they killed him you know that was the war was going on and i cried and i cried i mean we weren't close but he was in my school, high school together and we lost so many young people too at the time and then i used to say my dad, “dad, girls too were enlisting, wack and wave and i wanted to.” i really believed that’s the thing we should do to help this war but at that time they were thinking that the women were thought as [unclear 00:26:36] and my father says no.  i didn't think of it that way but he did and then i said maybe he's right and i didn't join but i did graduate and then i went to business college and then while i was still studying and it was about two weeks before graduation, my teacher said to me, "you know roseanne, they have two jobs openings for you," and they asked me, "who's the best one here?" you know who's the smartest girl that you have there and i was good with my book keeping and short hand and secretarial work and all that and she mentioned my name and she said, "go to the bank first  and then go to the appalachian, like a power company, that’s one of the biggest. you hear of appalachian mountains, it’s all the way up to here. janet: 	it’s called the appalachian? boulgouras: 	appalachian electrical power company. so i worked there for three years because they were paying more money and i just went to have an interview at the bank, they weren't as much and i didn't say anything, i said, "i'll think about it." so then i went to the electric power company they were paying more money so i stayed there for three years. 1941, mr. soc comes to [crosstalk 00:28:17]. male: 	good thing i showed up [laughter]. boulgouras: 	we met when i was in the junior high. janet: 	how did you meet when you were in junior high? boulgouras: 	i was coming home from school with my book under my arms-- male: 	[unclear 00:28:39] [laughter]. janet: 	[unclear 00:28:42]. boulgouras: 	i mean busted brown shoes [laughter], brown white and here he is across the street in his uniform [laughter] and he was talking to his uncle but his uncle had an interest in me and he was old enough to be my father. janet: 	his uncle was and you were a child? boulgouras: 	yeah, his uncle. he came to visit his uncle that’s how we met. male: 	she liked too [unclear 00:29:12]. boulgouras: 	the tender ones, no and i always called him uncle because my parents taught me the older people to say uncle and aunt although they weren't. janet: 	you call people uncle and aunt. boulgouras: 	yeah when we were young. so i met soc at the time you know, so he was so funny, he knew that soc was going to go down to see him and he didn't want anybody to meet me. he was very funny [laughter]. janet: 	he was saving you for himself. male: 	he was believing, this is mine and this is mine [laughter], that’s mine too and this too [laughter]. boulgouras: 	he was something else, he never was married, he never did marry either. anyway, you should have seen his face when soc and i were going to get married [laughter]. janet: 	so when you met for the first time, what did you do? you just saw each other? boulgouras: 	no, i was across the street, i didn't pay him attention at first but then i say, "who's that handsome guy with his uncle," i knew his uncle but [unclear 00:30:25] and soc stayed just for a few days, he had to leave and go into the service, he was going to go across.  so that’s how we met, we went dancing one night, that one night before he left and it was nice but - no i'm not going to say anymore.  i didn't know whether you know i thought he was a little short and this and that [laughter] but i said that’s okay, that’s okay, he's alright. male: 	yeah but the old greeks they used to have a different things for- what was it sweetheart? the olympics thank you and [inaudible 00:31:13]. anybody was this guy his name was peteo [unclear 00:31:20] and they used to give him, the committee used to give him a group of people like five or ten boys with him and he said, [unclear 00:31:33], the length of that bench they would. another guy had a [unclear 00:31:40] and show the legs [laughter]. boulgouras: 	so i wanted to say when i started working at the [unclear 00:31:47] and then he came down in 1941, i said that before, that was before he left. no, it was when you came out of the service, what am i saying? i'm sorry i've forgotten now. janet: 	did you correspond at all? boulgouras: 	he wrote to me. male: 	[unclear 00:32:08] [laughter]. boulgouras: 	no, no [laughter]. soc, come on, you know what it was. when i was working the office [laughter], he was writing and i never answered him. it wasn't because i didn't want to. i had his address in my address book. male: 	she didn't want to back then [laughter]. boulgouras: 	but, i don't know why i just didn't answer him. i should have, my dad said, "what’s the matter with you? he writes all this time, why don't you?" i said, "i will, i will," but it was the time when i was working. male: 	you were very very busy. boulgouras: 	we had bob there, he said, "you know what we have to do?" he said, "we have to get these girls together have their pictures taken and everything and send it across." send their pictures and let them know that the girls in west virginia really are thinking of them and wishing them well.  so one day, oh this thing it was so funny. here i am at the office and they had put the address where i was working, thank god they didn't send at the house right away and i received this big package and the girls says, "my god rose, who--?" male: 	the gown yeah [laughter]? boulgouras: 	no, so this guy was in the service i never knew him from- adam but he saw my picture and he chose me to write to and the other girls of course they had certain guys that preferred them you know what i mean but i didn't expect anything then i opened up the package and the girls got the biggest kick out of it because he sent me a grass skirt. i still have it in my [unclear 00:34:20] [laughter]. a grass skirt. male: 	you should have [unclear 00:34:26]. boulgouras: 	soc please the lady wants to get over with [laughter], grass skirt and letters of course and pictures and i have all that but i you know i like to keep them just to- not in person because i cut it off. he came down and i liked what i saw again he didn't have his uniform on. he looked good in his uniform of course [laughter]. male: 	and [unclear 00:34:56]. boulgouras: 	who [laughter]? male: 	the other guy. janet: 	so when he came back, you went to see your uncle? boulgouras: 	he came this time to see me and his uncle warned me and you know what he said to my husband? we weren't married of course, he knew now that soc was going to come down the minute he came out of the service so he says to my husband-- male: 	[unclear 00:35:25]. boulgouras: 	he wanted to marry me and i disappointed him to the point where i said, "you're old enough to be my father." i didn't mean to hurt his feelings because i knew he was really bad and i felt sorry for him, he was nice looking but he was old. male: 	that’s why he didn't want to [unclear 00:35:48]. janet: 	so what did he say to soc's return? boulgouras: 	socrates told them that he was going to come down to see me and before [laughter]. so before soc came down he comes up to me and he says, "now, i want you to give me an honest answer," in greek of course he was talking to me.  he says, "so do you want socrates to come down? he wants to come and see you." i say, "well, if he's going to come down--?" he says, "are you in love with him?" i say, "how do i know if i'm in love with him? i never went out with him or anything." and he says, "i want to know now so i can tell him not to come." male: 	he wanted a guarantee. boulgouras: 	so i say, "no, leave the man alone." and that was it and we didn’t' see each other again. janet: 	so did he warn you against seeing her? boulgouras: 	yeah. male: 	[unclear 00:36:56]. boulgouras: 	yeah but he didn't dare say anything to soc because soc already caught on right away. male: 	you know what i would tell him? "i'll go and buy you a gun to blow up your--" boulgouras: 	soc was mad and he was very upset for being his uncle you know. what do you thinking? male: 	and there is i knew two general [unclear 00:37:19] and these two doctors they were old enough and they [unclear 00:37:34] in love with the young chicks there, the daughters of the general. boulgouras: 	it was different in those days you know these older men thought, "well, i can get anybody i want." not from me, not from me. janet: 	so when you met then did your husband stay in west virginia? boulgouras: 	no, he was just out of the service you know. we decided on what month to go out. what month we were going to get married, that was september 15, 1946. janet: 	and so did you get married there in west virginia? boulgouras: 	yes, definitely. male: 	and the funny thing was, it wasn't a greek church either. boulgouras: 	no, you know what it was in welch west virginia where i grew up. where the high school is, now on the other side of the hill you go down the hill then another hill going up you know i found this all fascinating because the church, the episcopalian church, they called it.  the little red church on the mountain in other words like many a times you say, "oh that’s good luck to get married in little red church,"  i don't know if you’ve heard that described like that. that’s the way it was. that’s where we’re married although it wasn’t' a greek church but we had to have a greek priest to come from [00:39:27] virginia, reverend [unclears 00:39:29]. male: 	and where they used to wear no shoes. boulgouras: 	oh no i wore shoes [laughter]. i wasn't up in the mountains soc. male: 	the priest. boulgouras: 	oh forget him. janet: 	the priest, he didn't wear shoes? boulgouras: 	no, no. male: 	one time he was travelling and they stole his shoes [laughter]. janet: 	did you do any greek traditional things about the wedding? boulgouras: 	the wedding is all traditional greek all the way, greek orthodox. janet: 	did you remain religious in the greek orthodox church? boulgouras: 	yes, and of course i hated to leave welch because i was raised there and i knew a lot of people and i didn’t know how things would be here but i was just like a stranger and i was looking to find what i had down there and people here were kind of rude too. i had that real southern accent which i've lost after all those years but i got along better with them men up here than the women i would say [laughter].  they are not like that now, they know me better and they know i don't take any bull but i'm good too. i can be real good, down there people are so innocent like. soc and the southerners are just different people. i'm not saying they're all like that but i mean they're very hospitable. he knows he's served in the south [laughter]. janet: 	and when you came up here there was like probably a larger greek community than [crosswalk 00:41:28]. boulgouras: 	it was definitely yeah and we had good times, there was a dance that we didn’t' miss. we went everywhere and then of course he wanted children right away, i didn’t right away because i was only 21, just turned 21 and my husband wanted children right away because he was 31.  no, i was turning 22, what am i saying but anyway so a month after i'm pregnant. he wanted to keep me pregnant i think and barefooted [laughter]. no, i'm just kidding. so we lived in the house with his parents, that was terrible experience for me but anyway he knows all about it. so that’s about it. janet: 	why don’t' you say the names of your children also for the tape? boulgouras: 	right, my older son was constantine, god bless his soul he passed away. it will be nine years november the 10th when he passed away. in fact we're going to have his nine year memorial on sunday.  the oldest son constantine then my daughter federica boulgouras and alchibiabis boulgouras. you see in greece it’s a very popular name because they had a write up about alchibiabis the general so when he went to high school. male: 	he defeated the persian king. [unclear 00:43:21]. boulgouras: 	he loves his name, they call him al for sure and when he was little i'd call alchi, alchi instead of alchibiabis but people love that name. it isn’t' very common here in america but if you read the history book like al told me when he was in high school. they were studying the history language and they came across the name alchibiabis and [unclear 00:43:52] because they used to kid him about that name. he said, "no, that’s my name [laughter]." so cute. male: 	but she never mentioned my name? boulgouras: 	who? male: 	my grandfather? boulgouras: 	soc and we're talking about our children now and my other little child, socrates [laughter]. janet: 	so how is this time in your life? when your children are grown and [inaudible 00:44:24]? boulgouras: 	if we hadn't lost [unclear 00:44:28], i mean i'm grateful that i have the other two but there's something there that’s missing in our life and it bothers me. janet: 	how about the fact that you came here as a two year child and you left greece and really lived your whole life here, do you think that made a difference on who you are and the fact that you came from another place and started a new life over here? boulgouras: 	i don't think i would have changed anything because you see when you grow up believing the values your mother and father taught you. i'm not sorry about that, i am greek american, i'm more american than greek but i did have to have a citizenship papers, every time i went to canada i'd have to [unclear 00:45:32]. male: 	but you can stop being american citizen too? boulgouras: 	no, way. janet: 	would you have dual citizenship? [unclear 00:45:43]? boulgouras: 	no, i don't think so. now look at the difference, i was born in greece and raised in america. my sister was born in america and she lives in greece [laughter]. male: 	what the hell was that? boulgouras: 	so i have one sister, we don't see each other hardly in 1984 we went to greece, we stayed there three months with my husband. we went to vienna, we went everywhere you know it was so wonderful because that was the first time we had actually had a chance to really have like a second honey moon and then my brother in-law after he passed away and my poor sister she lost him when she was only 56 years old and he was 69.  so there was an age difference but he was a wonderful doctor and i miss nick a lot and then little did we know two years after that we're losing our son. janet: 	what do you think of the idea of a melting pot, i mean from your perspective you know that idea that america is the great melting point. male: 	it used to be. boulgouras: 	soc please, for me i'm very thrilled and happy to be an american. i am more american than greek i think and i won't give this country up for no other country in the world. we have our problems but when i hear and see what goes on in other countries over there. i love greece but i would never want to live there, no way. america is my country. janet:	okay, is there anything else that you can think of that maybe we haven't covered? boulgouras: 	i have kept this so long now. janet: 	i know, this is most interesting [chuckle]. boulgouras: 	so that’s the story of my life so far and i hope [laughter]. male: 	suppose you were in belgium fighting czechs in the world war, what would happen? boulgouras: 	oh, i'm not going to answer that [laughter]. male: 	let the dogs get you. janet: 	okay well, i want to say this is very interesting interview. boulgouras: 	yes, thank you so much. janet:  	and i thank you so much, it’s a pleasure to have both. boulgouras: 	i appreciate you coming over. male: 	so you're going to go to new york at all? janet: 	yes, i'm going to bring this back to new york and then put them in the ellis island library. boulgouras: 	that would be great. janet: 	send you a copy of the tapes. boulgouras: 	that would be great, do you want us to-- male: 	you can make a small little card from the ellis island and say you read the name- what the hell i know. boulgouras: 	oh, my send i an ellis island. i'm sorry. janet: 	okay wait, let me just say. i've been speaking with roseanne boulgouras and its november 1st, 1995 and this is janet levine for the national park service and i'm signing off.
