spinney: 	oh cowboys and indians. i expected to see cowboys and indians here. i was so surprised you know. to have a city, see cities big cities and that.  levine:	before you left was there a farewell for you? did you go by yourself? spinney: 	yes i went by myself, my mother and father took me and put me on the ship. levine: 	and what was that like? spinney: 	it was-i was excited with all the people on it you know but i was really scared but i was sea sick for five days and a storm come up and smashed the top of the ship and they had to repair that and everybody was running upon deck and screaming they thought they were going down. i was so sick that they threw me from the bunker onto the floor and i just laid there i didn’t care if i went down with the ship. and then they repaired the- they got me up on deck and walked me up and down and then we got into new york. it must have been about nine days we were late getting into new york. when we got in there, they quarantined for another week because we had an epidemic on board and they wouldn’t let me off. levine: 	do you remember what disease that was? spinney: 	it was something like a children disease it wasn’t anything really-i don’t know it was scarlet fever or something and then they-- levine:	 when they quarantined you had to stay on the ship? spinney:	 stayed on the ship yeah. i had to stay on there. levine: 	were you in the steerage part? were you down in the- spinney: 	no, i was second class. levine: 	you were in the little cabin? spinney: 	yes but there was two more women in with me. levine: 	did you eat in the dining hall? spinney: 	yes we did. it was a beautiful ship. she was sisters to the titanic you know. she was just as big as the titanic. it was a beautiful ship. levine: 	now you mentioned you had seen the titanic? spinney: 	yes i saw it when it went out. levine: 	oh tell me anything about that? spinney: 	well, my mother and father took me down there and i saw all the people there, a lot of american. that time i didn’t realize they were americans you know, of course to me it looks so immense you know and then the ship left.  it seemed like there was so many people there you know. and then about two days after wards, my mother woke up and she said to my father, “i had the funniest dream' she said "i saw big ship going down and everybody was singing on it, singing" and they came up later and they were singing dr. dee or something. i am just like my mother. i have seen things. levine: 	really? u huh. was that true when you were a little girl too? spinney: 	well, let’s see, the ship the titanic went down, i think it was 12, 1912. i think it was and of couse i would have been-about 7 years old. levine: 	in what way did you see things? did you have dreams like your mother? spinney: 	well, not then but i have had things in this country like- yeah i remember i wanted to go back to england and i told my husband i want to go- that was 50years i have been here the first time i went back but i had a dream, just like my mother. i saw that plane going down in the water. i got so scared. i said to my husband, “no i am not going.” it must have been two or three weeks later, my son called me up. he said, “mum, there is some people going from billerica to bellevue england. if you want to get on that trip, we’ll see that you get on.” i said to my husband, “i am going and i went.”  but a lot of things like with my family. my family is very close together and we send one another same christmas cards same birthday cards. i got my mother a bible once and it was second hand. i couldn’t find one that i wanted. i wanted one with all picture so she could make the families.  and i called her up the next morning on my 15th month and said “mum i bought you something' its second hand i don’t know if you would like it or not.” she said “did you buy me a bible?” we are like that about my family very much like that. levine: 	are you happy that you have that kind of a sense? spinney: 	oh yes i think it’s wonderful that god has given me that feeling.  levine: 	it’s sometimes called the 6th sense. spinney: 	i think it is, really is. levine:	well let’s see. do you remember what you packed when you left england? what you brought with you to america? spinney: 	my mother bought me suit and she made a beautiful velvet dress. it was trimmed with brown fur. do you mind if i- thank you dear. levine: 	what color was the dress? spinney: 	it was a deep blue and it had brown fur on it. levine: 	do you remember the style and everything? spinney: 	i can see it in my mind i wouldn’t know which style it was you know but she made all our clothes for us. levine: 	was it a long dress? spinney: 	no, no around the knees length you know. it was real good real pretty. levine: 	and did you wear that when you arrived in america or when you left or? spinney: 	i wasn’t supposed to wear it but i wanted to look nice on the boat and i put it on you know and i kept wearing it on the ship, then we got into ellis island and everybody said to me, “run up on deck and see the statue of liberty.”  so i ran up on deck and then somebody said to me, “did you bring your luggage with you?” i said “no” “you better run down and get your luggage,” so i ran down and it was gone. all my clothes and i had a lovely cross that my mother gives, somebody had stolen that too.  i landed on ellis island. i had dress-just what i had on my back and i was there for two weeks.  levine: 	so you must have not been feeling very happy when you- spinney: 	i wasn’t, i was scared. i was really scared.  levine: 	and what about ellis island? do you remember what you had heard about ellis island before you actually-? spinney: 	no, i never knew about anything about whatever i thought. naturally i thought was going to my sisters.  levine: 	oh. uhuh. spinney: 	i thought she would be there to greet me but she lived in boston of course but i didn’t know that. levine: 	do you remember anything about ellis island? how long were you there? spinney: 	how do i remember ellis island? it was a pretty lonely place for a girl at 16 and i might have gotten to the wrong room but i was put in a room or i went to a room, the men, women and children and they had these bunks and everybody slept in the same room. i never had the clothes off my back. all the time i was there and every day i go down-i had pictures of that right there the place where-oh jeez! i can remember so well and then every day we go down to that big room and if your name wasn’t called you know you will be there for another day.  so at the end of two weeks, they finally called my name. so i had to pay money to the tax or whatever it was. my mother often told me, never let that off you and i used to carry it in my chest. so i had that anyway and i slept with that and i paid that.  i had a little money left over they could have taken all my money. i didn’t know how much i had to pay or anything you know and they said to me, “now you’re going to boston on the train?” so they said to me “you better buy something to eat.” so i bought this box of sandwiches i thought.  and then they took us to new york on the ferry and they put me on an elevator. i have never been on one before and it started up and went backwards and landed on some man's lap [laughter] then they said to this young fellow, “are you going to boston?” they said, “yes,” “well will you see that miss rogers gets on the train to boston.”  so he was english like myself but i never knew him he was a stranger to me but we got into grand central station and he said to me “would you like a cup of tea?” i said, “i would love one.” he said, “you want anything to eat?” so i looked and saw an orange there that i hadn’t seen. i said, “i would like one of them oranges.”  and the man says, “lady those are not oranges, those are grapefruit.” i didn’t know the difference you know, so then we had to wait there. that was around five or six o’clock at night. we had to wait till midnight to get the train for boston. so he was very nice, he saw me on the train and in the seat and he left me. he left me and i was sitting all alone in that seat. levine: 	what were you thinking? can you remember what you thought at that time? spinney: 	oh i didn’t know where i was going. i would have gone to timbuktu i wouldn’t have known but they did stop at boston so that was the-and my sister was there and her husband there to meet me but it was awful. levine: 	is there anything else you remember about ellis island? do you remember the food?  spinney: 	i didn’t like the good very much and i can’t remember ever going in and sitting down. i remember they woke us up early in the morning, it seemed like 5 o’clock.  and then later on you wait around and they handed you an egg, boiled egg with a piece of bread. the italian bread that i learned of afterwards but i can’t remember many dinners there. i can’t remember. levine: 	what did you do during the day when you were there for two weeks? spinney: 	while mostly we were in that big room waiting, waiting. and oh then we had went to certain doctors. one doctor to another they examined you and everything you know but i never knew what to do. levine: 	do you remember any of your thoughts and feelings while you were there. spinney: 	yes, i made the acquaintance of a little girl there. she was irish she was there with her mother and i got acquainted with her. then all over sudden the mother come out and said she, “she can’t play with you.” i said, “why?” i found out afterwards they were irish.  	they did not like the english and i had to come to this country to find out that the irish didn’t like the english and when i landed in charles town, they put me in a school for six months because i got there i january it was the last of the month when i landed in ellis island.  it was december and by the time i got to boston, it was 1921. so they sent me to school from january to june till they went on vacation. and i got through and i was about 15 and half. 16 oh yes i want to tell you, at that time the irish been [unclear 00:24:26] they followed me like a pack of-because they were all irish there. levine: 	in charles town? spinney: 	in charles town and they called me a dirty rotten laimy. and the mother come out of her house she said, “you dirty rotten laimy they shouldn’t let you in this country.”  and the funny part of it, half of my family were irish. my father’s people come from ireland but my mother come from england. so they don’t know these things. why do they do that to people?  levine: 	were there other english children that you meet after you?- spinney: 	no, no. never did. levine: 	did you settle in charles town then? spinney: 	i settled in charles town then until i got married. i was married in 1924. i landed in charles town in 21 and i was married in 24. levine: 	and you were living with your sister in her house then? spinney 	no, i live with my sister for two years and then my mother and father came over and my brother. levine: 	what was it like to see them? spinney: 	oh it was wonderful to see then again you know and i went lived with them. levine: 	in charles town? spinney: 	yes, it was way down the main street where the elevator went right by the door [laughter] but then i meet my husband a couple of years later. levine: 	how did you meet him? spinney: 	well, my sister that time she had a boarding house and she had some people there lodging there and this man came and it was one of the man's brother and they introduced him to me, and so we started going together. we were going together for a whole year.  levine: 	was he born in america? spinney: 	yes he was born in eastport maine. levine: 	and was he of english decent. spinney: 	yes, they were english decedents and scottish decedents. they were all like-his people were really canadians but they meet and they came from england and scotland. they claimed scotland, the spinney come from scotland they said. levine:	 i see. what was it about your husband that attracted you to him? spinney: 	well naturally, when you are that age you get attracted to somebody.  levine: 	what did you like about him? is there anything in particular that- spinney: 	well he was the, first sweetheart i suppose i had but i was very naive. very naive. when i look back at it. levine: 	so what did you do when you would go out together? where would you go? what kinds of- spinney: 	we went-we go into boston. to a movie or something like that. but his brother and his wife moved, my sister changed her home and bought another boarding house so his brother and his wife came there.  so then my mother and father move to middle [unclear 00:28:05], and i didn’t want to go with them because i had my job in the [unclear 00:28:12] factory in watertown. so i took a room with my sister in her boarding house. so then that’s where he used to go and visit his brother and i'd see him then. so, then i had a son born two years later.  levine: 	what’s your son’s name? spinney: 	ralph. ralph spinney. levine:	 and what was your husband’s first name? spinney: 	george.

spinney: 	what am i? levine: 	what you most proud of? that you have done in your lifetime? spinney: 	i think having a family. working at it. making a home for them. we started out very small. the first home we ever got my husband paid $900 for it. it was just a shack. that was in the depression.  we had lost everything in the depression and he got $900 we got this shack. it was nothing else but little camp. and i worked on that and then made a big garden. and i did everything. i could show you the pictures the one i first started out? levine: 	oh good. after we finish with tape i’d love to see them. spinney: 	ok dear. yeah.  levine: 	so what was your husband doing at that point? spinney: 	my husband was a machinist on the boston main rail road and he was earning $28 a week and then later on he became assistant foreman. then later on he became the foreman. levine: 	so he did quite well? spinney: 	he did quite well. yes. levine: 	and then you stopped working? spinney: 	oh yes i stopped working after i bore my son you know. levine: 	then you made this little house into a home? spinney: 	yes, but of course between-before that i had been in rented, we rented. i went through charles town to chelsea, chelsea to somerville, somerville to everett, everett to west concord and from west concord we came to billerica. and after we moved from billerica for 30years, we moved to eastport maine and we were down there for about 15years and then my husband got sick. so we came back to billerica here. so i have been around. years ago they didn’t think nothing of moving you know. levine: 	why did you move when you moved? what was the reason? spinney: 	something was a little bit better you know and we the reason why we moved to concord, west concord-my husband's brother was the chef in the concord reformatory, and he was living on a house that was two apartments. so he said, “why don’t you come up here? and he said, “you can’t take the train to boston,” to my husband.  so we betted ourselves and went there. so my husband used to commute to boston because he was working in boston at that time but i got you tell you something i don’t know if i should tell you or not? but the man that we rented the house, he was a farmer and he went to store.  he bought a farm out in store and his wife didn’t want to go with him but he made her go and after they moved everything out we moved into the house and this went on for few years and the man used to come down and he would collect the rent you know.  and this went on for few years and all of a sudden, the hired man started coming down and collecting the rent and i asked him where was mr. steperthege? and he said, “oh he has gone to chicago.”  the next time he came down, “oh he'd gone back to poland,” and they always give me different answers you know.  so we didn’t think anything of it and he would sit with my husband on the porch and they would drink some tonic or some sort of drink. he was wonderful man. he seems so nice and he would walk around the place. moving things out you know. come to find out, he had murdered the two of them. the mother and buried them in the back. levine: 	oh my goodness. spinney: 	and then i started thinking of that man being around me, i really was scared you know. levine: 	that’s quite a story. spinney: 	i didn’t tell you when i was 34years old, i was operated on for a brain tumor and i am alive today. they expect me not to live but i did. levine: 	do you think that changed you in some way when you had that idea that you might not live and then- spinney: 	oh i really did. i really believe so much in god then, to let me live and so long. i said please let me see my grandchildren. i saw my grandchildren and am seeing my great grandchildren now. levine: 	good for you. spinney: 	[laughter].  levine:	 were you a religious family when you were back in england? spinney: 	not really, of course we were, we went to church and i went to sunday school and my mother would never cook on a sunday. that was their religion you know. levine: 	what religion were you? spinney: 	well i was an episcopalian but i have been to every church there is. i have been to the jewish churches. i have been into catholic churches. i go to every one of them they all believe in the same god and to me it doesn’t make any difference. it’s only something that you were brought up as a child, what you were taught by your mother. levine: 	do you think about death at this point in your life? have you- spinney: 	oh i do. i do right now but i am in hopes that i will have a few more years and if i don’t i am ready to go. i feel that god has been good to me and probably any time that he wants to take me now that’s all but if anything comes my way i am going live it. you see that live one day at a time and make it a masterpiece. levine: 	that’s great. ok thinking back over your whole life and coming here from england and really did you become a citizen? spinney: 	yes i did. levine: 	is there anything you would like to say before we close about your life either in england or coming here or? spinney: 	i have had a wonderful life and i see so much television, going into the room. i have seen so much and i hope my children would be just as lucky as i am to live as long as i have. they have so far. my son is 66 my daughter is 63. levine: 	okay, well i want to thank you very much it was a pleasure talking with you- spinney: 	oh you are welcome. okay dear. oh i shouldn’t do this but i get- levine: 	oh that’s okay. shows you have a lot of feelings. spinney: 	yeah [laughter]. levine: 	okay, this janet levine for the national park service and i have been talking with phyllis spinney at her home in billerica, massachusetts. it’s september 17th 1992 and i am signing off.
