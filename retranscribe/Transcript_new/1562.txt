 janet:	today is january 20th 1995. i’m here at the ellis island oral history studio with shaw tobias shaw, who is here visiting new york from london where she lives, mrs. or ms. shaw. shaw:	mrs. janet:	mrs. shaw came from poland to the united states in 1930 when she was 10 years of age. it’s a rare pleasure to have you here today, someone living outside of the united states who came through ellis island. why don’t we start at the beginning, if you would say where you were born and your birth date please? shaw:	i was born september 7th 1919 in stuttgart of polish jewish parents, by the mere fact that my father ran away from military service in poland because for a young jew to join the polish army was worse than death because it’s a continuous torture, they don’t kill you quickly.  my father left poland for stuttgart and my mother followed him. they married in germany and three children were born there. myself, i’m the oldest. i had a brother nathan who was the middle and my sister ann, who lives in newport, new york. my brother unfortunately died in poland.  we lived in a village outside of łódź which was called rudapabjanitz. it was a small town, i don’t know why my mother chose to have us live there because i …  janet:	could you spell that please? shaw:	i think its spelled r-u-d-a-p-a-b-j-a-n-i-t-z. this was in 1927 my father went to america where his older brother david had already immigrated and he sent for him. my father was going to send for the family afterwards.  he went to america from bremen. we went back to poland because my maternal and paternal grandparents were in poland. they lived in the ghetto, [inaudible 00:02:36] in łódź and around [inaudible 00:02:39] was the ghetto. around the ghetto were the mills, where most of the men and women worked because łódź was a great textile town, great textile industry.  as i said before, why we lived outside of town in a little village, i remember going to school and i still have photographs. i and another girl, dora, god i don’t know why i remember it. we were the only two jewish children in the school.  all the boys with their [crew cuts 00:03:20]. they were all bare feet except for us. i can’t remember if the girls were bare feet but we all had braids. the [inaudible 00:03:29] and the priest was a catholic school.  we lived there. my father, i can’t remember now whether he sent us $10 a week or $10 a month but whatever that made us rich. can’t remember whether we had a house or a flat or an apartment. in the apartment we had wooden stove that was lit by setting two pieces of straw alight.  unfortunately my brother’s night shirt caught fire and then i remember he went to hospital. as i now understand gangrene set in and they had no cures. anyway he’s buried in poland. in 1930 my father sent for us, there was my sister anna, myself and my mother.  i think there was something then called, you would know better than i, the 2% johnson quota law. probably named after a senator or a congressman, whoever passed it. i think what it meant is that 2% came from poland, two percent from russia, two percent from ukraine, hungary, romania.  in 1930 we left łódź went to [inaudible 00:04:57] by train. went to gdynia or gdansk, i don’t know which it’s called now, which was a port.  we took a small boat to join the ss george washington which i remember we said, ss george washington united states liners’, that’s what we called it. we landed in new york, perhaps we made one stop in south hampton, england, i can’t remember. janet:	before we talk about this country, let me just go back and fill in, what was your father’s name? shaw:	my father’s name was faivisch, which was americanized to philip. janet:	how would you spell faivisch? shaw:	f-a-i-v-i-s-c-h. janet:	your mother’s name? shaw:	my mother’s name was yetka y-e-t-k-a, in america it became yeta. janet:	how about her maiden name, do you remember that? shaw:	klutzkowski that was her maiden name. janet:	k? shaw:	with a k. k-l-u-t-z-k-o-w-s-k-i janet:	you were in germany up until 1927? shaw:	yes, perhaps 28, i can’t remember how long we remained in germany after my father left for america. janet:	do you have any memories about life there? shaw:	no, i seem to remember there was a fountain with a statue with a silver cup and where people could drink water. why i have that memory i haven’t a clue. nothing dramatic took place at the fountain or to me as a result of drinking the water. janet:	both sets of grandparents were in poland? shaw:	were in poland, yes. janet:	do you have memories of them at all? shaw:	i don’t have memories of my maternal grandparents. i don’t know i just don’t. i have memories of my paternal grandparents, my grandfather and my grandmother. i’m told i look like my grandmother and i have some photos of my grandmother. it’s difficult to tell the color of hair because she’s wearing a sheitel, that’s a wig like all orthodox women did in that day. janet:	can you remember any experiences with her or where they lived or [inaudible 00:07:38]? shaw:	yes they lived in łódź in the ghetto. i remember when you went into their house it had an arch. then there was a cobblestone courtyard and all the apartments, the stairs leading up to the apartments were around there.  i think we had cousins also living there. rudapabjanitz was not that far from łódź, i remember i once walked it. i followed the trolley car line. it wasn’t very far. it was totally jewish. i can’t remember any gentiles living there. janet:	was living in the ghetto at that time a benign kind of existence? was there any negative attached to living there? shaw:	no, if there was i was too young to be cognizant of it. it’s the only thing i knew. i remember all the wonderful food we used to eat. janet:	what food do you remember? shaw:	the [inaudible 00:08:56] and cholent. the friday before sundown my grandmother used to go to the baker with a pot of cholent and take it down. it cooked overnight and then it was taken out after sundown on saturday. we ate that and all the sweet dishes with it.  the food, very much what you have here now, [inaudible 00:09:24] which comes out of a jar, but it was made. since the [inaudible 00:09:31] came into existence i can make it too, because i don’t have to stand and chop, just put it in. i think they were lighter than my mother’s or grandmother’s. janet:	how about aunts or uncles, cousins? shaw:	yes i had aunts, uncles, i had cousins. i can’t remember what they did, what my aunts and uncles did. we were a close-knit family, spread out. i had a beautiful cousin who, very soon after immigrated to america, she and her boyfriend. he wasn’t her husband yet immigrated to south america where they became multi-millionaires, it’s extraordinary, they went to são paulo. janet:	did you have communication with them? shaw:	yes i still do to this day. she’s dead. she was so beautiful she looked like an american film actress called margaret sullivan. had the same hairdo a bob, all my cousins bobbed their hair. one sister went to brazil, são paulo. another sister went to argentina who didn’t fare as well but sarah, the sister who did well she took care of the sister in argentina. eventually brought her to brazil where she died.  the other cousins were killed during the war. two of the children went to israel. they just managed to make their way to israel. i think joined the british army and then went back to israel where they’re no longer alive but where their children live now. i have quite a large family in israel, [inaudible 00:11:35] most people.  of course my grandfather, everybody was killed. we got out in time i suppose without planning. at my age, i felt no anti-semitism, perhaps because i was always in jewish circles. even this little town where we lived, outside the school there was a community.  we had a rabbi and all the shops we went to were run by jews. the butcher was a jew because he was a great friend of my mother’s. i always suspected she had a little romance with the butcher, she was a young woman. janet:	you were going to a polish catholic school? shaw:	yes, it was the only school in town so i had to go there. janet:	did you learn …? shaw:	all i spoke was yiddish and polish. janet:	german i suppose yiddish is pretty close to [inaudible 00:12:49]? shaw:	my mother spoke german because of the years that she spent in germany. no, i didn’t speak german. now, when i used to have to go to germany, i could get by between the german and the yiddish i made myself understood. janet:	can you remember any things that you and your sisters and your mother did for enjoyment while you were in poland? shaw:	my mother always fancied herself a bit of a singer. she was always a member of some choral society, which when we came to america she continued.  we went to the movies a lot, because in our little village we had a movie theater. i first became acquainted with the american film stars. i remember barbara la marr, billie dove and conrad nagel. because we had some money so we could spend it on these so-called frivolities. janet:	was that unusual to have a movie theatre in a small village? shaw:	i don’t know because i never went to another small village to see what they had. when i would go and visit my grandparents, we would go to the movies in łódź and there were many movies. łódź was a very sophisticated city at that time, it had boulevards and hotels and fancy shops.  janet:	could you say what your idea of america was like, probably formed a lot by the films you saw? shaw:	the movies? absolutely, also the people didn’t know what america was like- it was the golden medina that we were coming to. of course we came in the middle of the depression. we moved to harlem into a walk-up flat, three flights up. my father barely scrapped a living, but somehow we survived. janet:	you were actually living in a way better in poland than when you …? shaw:	yes. it was terrible. i remember by then my sister and i were in school. when i got to be about 12 or 13 i used to wish my father had a city job like a street cleaner. they were weeks when he didn’t earn that much. the cost of living was less but still, everything’s relative. janet:	is there anything else about life in poland? any things that you remember when you think of your years there, they come to your mind? shaw:	no, not really, i just remembered that life went on in the courtyard, particularly when it was warm everybody’s windows were open. we weren’t allowed in the street. all the children played in the courtyard because they had horses and trolley cars and motorcars.  i had some friends, and i always think of a girl i think her name we lotta. this is when we were going to america, we knew we were going. we moved from the small village back with my grandparents. i remember she came to stay with us and we were going to america and she was going back to leipzig, with her parents. she probably didn’t survive. janet:	can you describe yourself as a 10 year old, what you were like when you [inaudible 00:17:17]? shaw:	yes i can. i had tremendous vitality, tremendous energy, that my mother had no comprehension of, she did not. i was the bad girl, my sister who’s quieter, she was the good girl. i was wild. my mother said she used to walk with me and i would pull girls’ pigtails, i don’t remember that. janet:	what was your mother like? shaw:	my mother was a nice enough woman. she tried her best, but i think in many ways she was like me, had a lot of energy, a lot of drive. it went nowhere because it had nowhere to go. she failed to recognize myself in her. i left home very early because we didn’t get along. janet:	when you were about to leave for america, do you remember what you expected or what you thought before you actually came? shaw:	yes, we were going to the golden land where we’d all be rich. the poverty that we met in america didn’t affect me very much, if i recall. because we were busy absorbing a new country. within six months my sister and i spoke english, i don’t know what kind of english we spoke.  i regret it till this day that i forgot polish so quickly. my parents spoke yiddish at home. i can still speak yiddish but [inaudible 00:19:17] foreign language. i’m not very good at languages, because i know subsequently when i went to places like czechoslovakia or russia. where they spoke slavic tongue, words would come back to me. even till this day, i haven’t been back to poland. if i went back i think i could pick up the language very quickly. i don’t feel an affinity with poland because they’re just hateful people. they’re all slavs and polls and ukranians and russians, they would like to see us all dead. its endemic, it comes with the mother’s milk, they don’t understand intellectually why, they just hate us. people hate a survivor, they may not hate they resent. janet:	this is something that you’ve arrived at later [inaudible 00:20:26] that time you didn’t feel [inaudible 00:20:28]?  shaw:	no understanding, no comprehension. janet:	were you examined before you boarded the ss george washington? shaw:	yes. we went to the doctor and i think we got certificates. because later on when i read stories of ellis island or when we did the miniseries ellis island. i remember they were looking for glaucoma or cataract and the doctors examined you there. we weren’t examined on arrival. we were examined at the other end. we came with our certificates. janet:	do you remember anything about the voyage that stands out? shaw:	yes, crowded because we were four in a cabin. i can’t remember who the fourth person was in the cabin. can’t remember if i was seasick or not. it was just a melee of people and eating, always eating.  there was no entertainment. i think we made our own entertainment, we used to sing -i remember my mother singing. we used to sing and kind of dance around. janet:	you went up on deck? shaw:	yeah on our deck, we never ventured any further. can’t remember how long the voyage took, must have taken six or seven days then, because now it’s a five day voyage. janet:	do you remember the ship coming into the new york harbor? shaw:	vaguely, i remember seeing the statue of liberty, but that’s all. janet:	did it mean anything? were you responding to it in any way that? shaw:	a child just concentrates on the little square that you’re in. janet:	how about then coming to ellis island, what was your impression coming here? shaw:	the building doesn’t look as i remember it, everything’s changed. my memory of ellis island really comes from books, with the illustrations. i remember the big hall, sitting under the initial t, tobias. the name was tobiash. i don’t know he looped off the h, so it became tobias. i guess it was easier it pronounce and my father coming to get us. janet:	what was that like, seeing your father? shaw:	i don’t remember but my mother says that she had to pull his sleeve and said, “faivisch, it’s us.” she said [inaudible 00:23:37]. then after having eaten all the bananas, going to my aunt’s house, reaching for the banana and passing out for 24 hours. janet:	why don’t you tell that story [inaudible 00:23:53]? shaw:	as i said before because of the $10 a week or the $10 a month that my father used to send us, my mother could go into łódź where they had specialty shops. she bought pineapple, bananas, oranges and brought them home. my sister and i were used to them, and i loved bananas.  when we got on the boat they would serve fruit at the end of the meal. the majority, i would say, had never seen a banana before much less eaten one. they also thought it wasn’t kosher. i just ate up all the bananas.  then after my father recognized us, picked us up and took us back to my aunt’s house, his brother’s wife’s house. they lived in coney island and the home had a big bowl of fruit where the banana was on top. i reach for the banana, took a bite and passed out.  i was out for 24 hours, they sent a doctor which i don’t remember and they told him what i did. now we know i had too much potassium, i overdosed on potassium. i never ate a banana or a banana split or anything with banana flavor. until about nine years ago when my husband was taken ill and the doctor said to him, “you need potassium, take the banana, eat the banana.”  in order to help him along i ate bananas and i discovered i like them. i don’t gorge on them anymore, but i have things with banana flavor and i’ve had a banana split. that’s my banana story. janet:	when you left ellis island, how did you get to your uncle’s house? shaw:	i can’t remember.  janet:	where was it? shaw:	it was in coney island, not brighton beach it was coney island. janet:	then did you stay with your uncle? shaw:	no, we didn’t stay. then my father took us to the flat that he found for us in manhattan. i can’t remember how we got there either. janet:	do you remember any things that struck you as new and different in those initial days in new york? shaw:	everything was new and different. i can’t say that i was taken aback by anything, i don’t know. i think i had no period of adjustment. when i got married, i married an english man. i went to live in london in 1961. i had no period of adjustment there either.  i adjust very quickly to surroundings, climates, except heat, i’m not comfortable with heat. the london climate, the english climate suits me perfectly. janet:	where did you go in new york in manhattan then when you …? shaw:	we lived on 102nd street. we were also enrolled in a school to continue our education in yiddish, to read and write. it was i think a communist school.  my parents were very left wing, i don’t think they were intellectual communists because they were emotional communists, a lot of people were. in those days, particularly in the depression, communism seemed to offer the only alternative of a better life for the working men.  i went to yiddish school and i used to be able to write, as i haven’t used the written word. i can read headlines in a newspaper but i speak it. when i go shopping in london, we have these religious communities. i follow the women around to hear them speak yiddish, because they really speak it still brilliantly. i hear words that i haven’t used for years.  we went to the school and we went to the american school. i learned to speak, read and write. my mother also went to night school to learn. she ended up being able to write in english and speak english.  i graduated public school, what was ps 72 in manhattan. then i went to julia richman, for a half a term, six months. then we moved to the bronx. i was enrolled in julia richman and in james monroe high school, where i went for a year and i just had to go to work.  first of all, my mother forced a commercial course on me. i kept failing in bookkeeping, till this day i can’t add. she wouldn’t let me change to a general course, to an arts course so i left. i was determined to have a better life than she or my contemporaries had. how, i don’t know. janet:	this is a good point. this is side b of the interview with shaw tobias shaw. you were saying that you were somehow going to have a better life than those around you. shaw:	yes. i had a lot of energy and i was motivated. i used to be a very good dancer and i used to win dance contests. then i decided to do something with the dancing. i went to learn ballet in modern but very early i learned i had no elevation and no coordination. i didn’t want to end jump being the last girl in the third row of some touring company of the student print.  i had no money. i had left home by this time.  i was sharing a flat with four other girls of on west 47th street across the street from the police station. through my dance classes, i began to meet people in the theater and i began to have serious relationships with men.  remember i had no academic background so i began my education. my education began before when i still lived at home, i had one hour to travel each way on the irt and i would read and read. i always carried a dictionary because i didn’t understand a lot of words.  janet:	was your reading in any particular [inaudible 00:32:27]? shaw:	i read the classics. i would hear people talking. i would go to the library and get the book, because i couldn’t afford to buy books then.  i knew i couldn’t make a living as a dancer. while i was taking classes i worked at [inaudible 00:32:46], i was waitress. i was a waitress in summer camp. i did all kinds of menial jobs to support my classes but once i knew i couldn’t make it as a dancer i just decided something had to happen.  through someone, through someone, through someone, i met somebody in public relations and i got into that. i couldn’t write but i was a very good ideas person. they took me off the writing and i fed ideas.  then through someone, through someone, i got into cbs as a floater. i would relive people who were ill or on holiday, in all departments. one of the departments i relived was the casting department. i liked that and they liked me, they said to me when an opening comes would i care to join them and i said yes. i worked at cbs in the casting department.  through another, i can’t remember how, i met someone from the american national theater and academy. they were going to europe with porgy and bess. they were doing a world tour. they asked me if i wanted to come and do their public relations. because if they had me, i think they only paid me $150, this was in 1954. if they had a union person they would have to pay $350.  i travelled all over the world with porgy and bess. then when i came back, end of 1955, i had no job, no money because i spent all my money in europe. i thought, “when i’m i going to be here again?” janet:	what we’re doing when you were travelling with porgy and bess? shaw:	i did their pro. i went ahead of the company and set up. as we were sent by the united states department, it was called the usis, the united states information something. i went ahead, arranged with the embassy’s always a reception with the ambassador and made a list of people to invite. i travelled 10 days ahead of the company to all these places.  we covered the globe. we were in france for three months, in italy for three months. we went to yugoslavia, egypt, israel, holland, belgium, it was a fantastic trip. anyway when i came back i had no work. i had sublet my apartment to two girls and they wrecked it so whatever money i made i had to spend fixing it up again.  i went out to the airport to laguardia to see someone off to california. i ran into somebody who had been at cbs, was now a producer to film studio. he asked me if i wanted to come and work for him so i said sure. when that was over i got another job with another company. now we are in 1960, when i met my husband. janet:	in new york? shaw:	in new york. we got married and in march 1961 i went to england. janet:	how did you meet him? shaw:	he came over in a play, the hostage. i met him at a party backstage the first night. it was love at first sight. then we got married. i was married for 25 years before he died. janet:	what was his full name? shaw:	his name was maxwell shaw. he gave me a choice, he said, “do you want to live in new york or do you want to come to england?” i knew my marriage didn’t stand a chance in new york because i had so many pulls from people, things.  england, although i used to be sent to england by the organization i worked for. i used to go every year for two weeks to see all the theater. in england i would have to depend on him, i had nobody there. i knew some people but nothing. that’s what we did. it was his home. i did the biblical thing, whither thou goest i will go. janet:	once you got to england did you continue with your career? shaw:	yes, i got pregnant but i had a miscarriage and then i could not conceive again. we decided that wasn’t the most important thing. i was never that maternal. i was so happy to be married to somebody that i was in love with because i had never really been in love before. i had my [inaudible 00:38:13] passion. janet:	your husband was an actor? shaw:	yes. he was an actor for a short while but then he became an academic. he was too smart to be an actor. janet:	then you, as far as your own career? shaw:	when americans started to come to england to produce for television, they knew where to contact me. they asked me if i wanted to work for them, i said yes and began my career there. now i’m what you call the [dorian 00:38:54] of casting directors. that means i’m old. janet:	what do you feel most proud of that you’ve accomplished? shaw:	25 years of a good marriage. janet:	that’s quite an accomplishment.  shaw:	i’m not interested in men anymore. i’m not interested in having a, as you americans call, a meaningful or a non-meaningful relationship. i’ve had the best. i don’t mind being on my own, i’m okay. janet:	what is this phase of your life? what do you …? shaw:	i’m kind of semi-retired. it’s a young people’s business. the people who are coming into it now, remember i’ve always worked only for americans because they kept me busy. they would come over to do things in europe and they would ask for me. they’re of a certain age so they don’t work as much.  it affords me the time to travel. i’ve been to india twice, i’ve been to china. i go every other year to israel. i go to france. i have a cousin in france. i go to italy. where else have i been since? i want to see australia. i want to see south africa.  i’d love to go to japan but it just never seems to be the right season because it’s very humid there, i don’t know, time just goes. i lead a quiet life in london. i have a little georgian house. janet:	when you do work is it in casting? is that what your career has been in? shaw:	yeah. janet:	you’ve obviously settled in london, do you have any ideas of ever returning to the us? shaw:	i could never live in new york again. it’s too crowded, it’s too noisy, it’s too dirty. there are too many things going on, i mean i look at the papers and there are 20 concerts, 880 movies, it’s too much for me.  too many television channels, we only have four. i’m sure that will change but it’s too much. the pace of my life is slower and i like it that way. no, i couldn’t live in new york again and i was like ms. new york, anything above 72nd street was the country. janet:	you say you adapted easily shaw:	very. janet:	you never looked back once you …? shaw:	never. i think since 1961 i’ve only been back four times. janet:	are you an english citizen? shaw:	no i’m an american citizen, because i don’t vote in the american elections and i don’t understand english politics. i’ve abdicated in a way, i’ve done my screaming, my shouting, my matching, nothing’s changed. let the young people do it now. it really doesn’t matter what passport i have. i’m not reactionary, but i went from left to right. janet:	do you think the fact of immigrating to this country at 10 years old, living here and then in england. do you think that has affected your personhood or your character in any way that you can think of? shaw:	i don’t know, look at my sister, she’s completely different than i am. i don’t think so. i have no hang-ups. i don’t remember ever being abused, everybody is being abused now, they think back they’re abused. everybody is sexually harassed.  when i was a young girl, if i wasn’t sexually harassed once a day, i’d go home and stick my head in the oven, “what’s the matter? i’m losing my sex appeal. nobody tried to fill me up or give me a goose or give me a kiss?”  these women are crazy, what’s sexually harassed? you either say yes or no. i’ve never, in all my experience all my life with men, i said no that was the end of it. men were no different then than they are now. i think women are, women are more aggressive, i’m not a feminist i should tell you. women are aggressive, they’re loud, they’re vulgar, they’re pushy. i like a feminine lady, feminine woman. i was always liberated so i never had to seek to be liberated. i made my own liberty. some of the women that i run into in new york, maybe the rest of america isn’t like that, they are, spare me. janet:	aside from some hang-ups of changing countries, do you think you’ve drawn on that in any way in your work or the fact of uprooting and [inaudible 00:45:23]? shaw:	no. it’s just a progress that was my life. i can’t say that one thing affected me more than the other. i’ve no hang-ups about anything. there must be something wrong with me. janet:	obviously you don’t think it’s important to have those hang-ups. shaw:	no it isn’t. life is difficult enough. it’s difficult getting a taxi, it’s difficult of me to get shoes because i have a wide foot and i have to get size c width, you have aches and pains. why inflict all those other things on you?  there’s fighting all over, it’s in your living room. there’s blood in your living room every minute of the day. there are people starving. i’m not going to out to save them but there’s nothing i can do. they elect the people who forced those things on them. i’m not saying so they deserve what they get, but people allow themselves to be led around by the nose. janet:	is there any project or anything in particular that you would like to do? shaw:	no. janet:	that you’re looking forward to doing? shaw:	no. janet:	the travelling? shaw:	just travelling, that’s all. janet:	if there’s anything else you can think of relevant to our …  shaw:	no i can’t and don’t get me started on the royal family. janet:	is that an interest? is that something you follow closely? shaw:	i follow closely because they live on my money. you know that by the sheer accident of birth, these mental cripples live a lavish lifestyle that i and others -because i pay taxes. they are mental cripples and that goes from the queen down.  diana is a bimbo, charles is a useless with that camilla, i mean he’s a joke. edward would rather wear women’s clothes and then andrew is- they’re useless. they contribute nothing to the country, nothing at all. they’re illiterate. their feet never touch the ground because they don’t come among people. they come among their own like. they don’t know what’s going on in the real world.  i loathe them i really, not in my lifetime but i think the next lifetime i think it will be the end of the british monarchy. janet:	on that note, i want to thank you very much for a very interesting interview. i’ve been speaking with rose tobias shaw. it is january 20th 1994 and we’re here at ellis island. this is janet levine for the national park service and i’m signing off.
