 cathy:	good afternoon. this is cathy norton for the national park service. i’m student intern and bachelor’s degree candidate from new york university’s school of continuing education. today is monday august 22nd, 1994 and i’m in the recording studio of the ellis island oral history project with ebetino ebetino who came to america from italy in 1910 when he was five years old.  welcome mr. ebetino. why don’t you begin by giving me your full name and date of birth please? ebetino:	i was fred ebetino and my birthday is the 25th of february, 1904, i was born. cathy:	where were you born?   ebetino:	i was born in terilletzi. cathy:	could you spell that for me please? ebetino:	t-e-r-i-l-l-e-t-z-i. it was close to bari, b-a-r-i, was the big town and my dad worked for a count leone who was a big landowner, 25,000 or 2,500 acres where they grew all kinds of olives and fruits and nuts. his father was a head of the gang of ... they had all kinds of trees, nuts and vineyards and they were the pruners of all these thousands of trees.  that was quite an honor over there that they pruned trees, let them grow to a certain size and then they ... in order to get the best quality fruit that they could possibly get. of course, then he went to the army. that was before he got [inaudible 00:02:17]. i’m sorry, maybe you’ll want to ask that later. cathy:	tell me about the town. ebetino:	ma’am.  cathy:	tell me about the town. tell me about terllitzi. ebetino:	terllitzi? cathy:	can you describe the town? ebetino:	my grandfather there or my wife’s father ... my mother’s father ... it was a real nice town. it has a cathedral there and highly ... one of the real fine catholic churches there. in fact, i still send some money over there to them for christmas and they have put a plaque up in the cathedral in honor of the ebetino family. then we later gave money for a new pew that they were changing there and i still send some money over there to them for christmas. cathy:	do you remember the name of the cathedral?  ebetino:	it was the terllitzi cathedral was ... it was just about there.  cathy:	i’m sure we could look that up. was your family … what was religious life like with your family back then? ebetino:	we went to catholic church there and then my dad who came over, he came over in 1907. we were in a section, like i say, a fruit growing section in southern italy. he was supposed to go to california but on the way over, they were building the new york [inaudible 00:04:30] go on to boston.  they paid him good wages because they knew a lot of the italians were pretty good at rock cutting and stuff like that. one would hold a big drill to get it a little like that and two with sledgehammers would pound on the drill to make hole for dynamite to blast the rock for the rock bed for the new york [inaudible 00:05:04].  	he liked the town and fortunate for me, it was right next to the golf course. i took a liking to the game just, had sports in my blood, i guess. i started out. i was too small to caddy but a lot of [inaudible 00:05:34] not too far from water. we’d stand over there and some of the golfers would slice over that and we’d run over and grab the ball and take it in and get a dime or a nickel or something because i was too small to caddy at that time.  	then i graduated from caddying and i used to run the lessons ball for the pro that he liked me because i’d run and the golfers would get … to hit more balls. 	he started me in the pro shop and the pro shop had started. they had two club makers at that time that manufactured the clubs right there in the pro shop, of course, you could buy. you had the sand, the shafts and we’d start out learning to after they send them down, wet them and let them dry and get the … out of the veins as a club, get that … it was kind of a growth in the … and rub that out in order to leave a little indentation. that’s where they put this stuff over and made it.  	then i got to playing pretty good and i got more favors because i worked with the pro and he wanted and i’d get to playing and it was ... i thought it was great and fortunately, for me, that was my whole life. that was in golf.  	i wanted to … first pro job i had was in port washington, long island and i was 19 years old when i started in the pro. at that port, washington, was julius weismann the east man had an estate there and he has a nine-hole golf course and the second wife had two boys, 9 and 11. i was hired to teach the boys and take care of the guests and oversee the golf course there in port washington and that’s where i met the prince of wales.  	he invited the british polo team to use his field to practice on them because the matches where in westbury, long island, the english against the united states, when mr. fleishman didn’t play. it was lord winterbourne who financed the team. then i played when i was [inaudible 00:09:05] that he had players, somebody to play with and we were playing number seven. the fourth company had given the british polo team ... they turned over six limousines with chauffeurs that they took there.  	we were playing number seven when the prince of wales who was then about 17 years old came in the gate. we were playing number seven right near the gate and he’d come into the gate and he talked to the … the prince of wales wanted to talk to lord winterbourne. he came over to the number eight-hole and i went and asked him, “sir,” i said, “would you like to play the hole?”  	he said, “no,” he said, “i’ll just watch it,” and so that was my first great shake of the hands and be real ... because he was real down to earth for a young ... most people. then he … his wife was the second wife to fleishman and he had two boys and that’s what he built that golf course for her. cathy:	mr. ebetino, i want to ask you about your father. can you describe your father for me, his personality? ebetino:	my father came here in 1907 and then we came over in 1910. cathy:	what was your journey like? ebetino:	 ma’am. cathy:	what was your journey like? ebetino:	it was terrible. like i said, we headed to the [inaudible 00:11:06] head south to stay in warmer waters and stay away from the icebergs see because that’s what happened to the … 10 months later, they built a super ship over in england that was supposed to be sinkable … it couldn’t be sunk. the ship was built with three keels. they had one keel the ship come down like that about a third of the way back and then there was a wall on both sides. there was another keel like this and another one here with a vacancy up to the … just so high so that if one keel got hit with an iceberg then they’d have two. 	 but what happened was the helmsman called the captain. he says, “captain,” he says, “there’s an iceberg in our path and here he says, “to hell with the iceberg, full speed ahead,” and that ship hit that iceberg and got up on it and by that time, it got to the opening and it shot up there. that’s why the ship went down in an hour’s time. cathy:	what was the name of the ship that you traveled on? ebetino:	it was from the canal line and that was the ship that we’d come into here to ellis island and in order to [inaudible 00:13:08] us my dad missed the train coming from rye, new york into new york city and then coming down here. he had to stay here overnight before he could claim us. cathy:	did you travel with other family members?  ebetino:	ma’am. cathy:	did you travel with other family members? did other family members come over with you? ebetino:	yeah. yeah, there was some … quite a few of the italians from the same part of italy, which we are on the adriatic side and then we went to naples on there. cathy:	did you come here alone? where you alone on the ship or was there family with you, your family was with you? ebetino:	yeah. three of us were born in italy and my other brother, oldest brother and my sister and we had two others. in fact, you got one of my younger brother’s michael ebetino on your thing there is showing donors and i made a family donation to but that trip we was a day and a half longer than it was supposed to be. it was just even going south it was just a rough, seemed like we had a head wind. 	there was only one time that they allowed the people up on the deck, up on the top deck because it rolled so much it was dangerous for people to be up there. they had to ... of course, we were sick and there was a lot of moaning and people couldn’t keep food on their stomachs and the smell was kind of bad and they told us to eat all pickled stuff, sour stuff and not eat any sweets at all. like i say, we were a day and a half late getting on our schedule because of the rough waters. he claimed this and then went to grand central station in new york and picked up the train to new york [inaudible 00:15:55] that goes through rye where he was working at that time.  we got on that train and i was little. i was five. i wasn’t quite six. i was crawling between the seats and found a quarter and i took it to my mom. i said, “mom, look at what i found.” she looked at it. my dad knew what it was because he was like. he said, “that’s a quarter.” she says, “i heard that people say that they found money on the streets.” we rode the ride and made our home there and was there until i was 18 and would have been 19 the following summer and that’s where i first got my pro … first pro job was at sands point, julius fleishman, that was fleishman from the east cup. cathy:	tell me how you felt when you first saw the statue of liberty. ebetino:	i’ll tell you. i’ve never seen such an emotional outbreak. people kissed each other. they kissed the boat and they kissed each other and it was unbelievable. the emotion that was in that crowd. of course, and then of course, dad he sent for us after he was ... he came over in 1907 and in 1910, he sent us. we came on the canal line from naples to new york.  cathy:	did you have to go through any medical examinations here? ebetino:	yes, yeah, yeah, because they warned us to. said that don’t get sick or fever or cold, they’ll send you back. my mother was very careful in keeping us so we didn’t have any coughs, anything like that because they warned us that there if you had some sickness or if you had fever you would … you were held there. a lot of people they sent them back. cathy:	how long did you stay at ellis island? ebetino:	well, were there ... the boat got in there on the 10th of february or january rather and we were at ellis island for two days. we had enough money and my dad was there to vouch for them and pick us up but he missed one of the trains. he had to come into grand central station and then from there to come down here and he didn’t get in until afterwards 5:00. at that time, 5:00 was the deadline and so he had to wait and stay there … around there and got a room and then came over the next morning and picked us up. cathy:	how were you treated here while you were staying at ellis island?  ebetino:	how did they treat us? cathy:	yes. ebetino:	we thought they were real nice to us and of course, my mother kept us pretty well cleaned up and the boys and we were warned not to get a cold or not to have any fever. then he didn’t have too much of a time getting us out and coming to … by subway to the big state railroad station. cathy:	what did you think of grand central station? ebetino:	that was some … trains come in from all directions. we went out on the new york, new haven and hartford, which goes along the east along the coast. it goes through rye and port chester was the last town in new york and then you were in connecticut. that’s what they were building. the next railroad line on each side. before there was only two lines and they built it one so they’d have the fast passenger train. they didn’t want to stop to certain bigger towns. we was on that. then they had the locals where you got off at these different smaller towns between there and rye, and new york. cathy:	what was your mother like?  ebetino:	she was beautiful and … cathy:	how did she feel about coming to america? ebetino:	ma’am. cathy:	how did she feel about coming to america? ebetino:	she had her doubts especially because my dad had been. he was in the army and before he got married and went over there and fought in ethiopia and he almost got it. one of the natives with a bayonet caught him right across the [inaudible 00:22:45]. it caught him there so they send him back to italy. it was kind of a bad wound and it almost got this one eye of his.  	we had a home there. we bought the first home. it was three storeys in an acre ground and for $1,800. mother and dad both liked gardening stuff. we spaded that acre ground by hand because we didn’t have any ploughs. there wasn’t any ploughs or spade that, hold it and we grew a lot of vegetables and stuff.  	my brother and i we had a wagon about like that. we’d fill it up with a lot of these vegetables and sell them to the neighbors down through there, around different places. mother was our baker, she baked all the bread and of course, we did the kneading. my brother and i did the kneading of the bread. we always do it out on friday and bake enough bread to last us a week.  	she’d always give us a piece of dough and that’s for the pizza first. that was way back. we’d flatten it out and put tomatoes and peppers and when we raised all these tomatoes we … our mother used to make sauce out of it. we’d boil it until it got about ... until it was and she’d make round rolls like about that thick and about 8 or 10 inches. she’d  and then she’d slice those but she’d use a lot of [inaudible 00:25:34] and keep putting it over and i would build a crust on it. that bread was fresh and good on fridays as it was until the next friday.   	she was a hard worker and my dad was and we took our turns at the hard work too. in fact, we had a little ground marked off that we used to do some spading before going to school. our people thought the parents were mean to us but i didn’t. i didn’t mind the chores and that’s how i was going to say.  	we were making pizza before they ever had any idea of it, making it here in the states. my gosh, what a big business it turned out to be that you put tomatoes and peppers and onions and tomato. we’d get a lot of the tomatoes and she’d boil them and everything to get the skin off of them. then she’d make tomato sauce and put it in crocks, open crocks and then put bay leaves on top of it to keep it.  	we had three apple trees on the acre ground and we’d made cider and meadow and well, she was a hard worker and so was my dad and we would work. i think if today people made their kids work like we did, they’d probably have them arrested for mistreating these youngsters.  cathy:	did your family speak english before they got to america? ebetino:	right before we got here, no. we finally went to school and they had a preliminary school where we lived for the first three grades. then the main school was about a mile and a half downtown on rye just a short way from there. we didn’t have any buses. we walked that mile and a half to school and walked back and we had to go over a railroad and it was a hill.  	in the wintertime, when it was ice and snow they had guardrails along and we’d walk one hand on the guardrail going down and coming up almost the same thing. i guess a lot of people thought we … my mother and dad were hard on us but we didn’t mind it. cathy:	mr. ebetino, we are going to pause for a moment while our recording engineer flips the tape. ebetino:	okay. cathy:	hi, this is cathy norton and i’m speaking with ebetino ebetino and we are on side two of our interview on our interview tape. mr. ebetino, i’d like to ask you if you could tell me a little bit about your grandfather. ebetino:	my grandfather his name was [bauarelli  00:30:05] and my dad come over here three years before we did. he came over in 1907. we came over in 1910. after we ate, we’d go to … mother would take the kids and we’d go over to my grandma’s house and grandpa would always be in the high chair and i had sit next to grandpa. he say, “freddie,” he says, “you are not going to go to america, are you?” i said, “grandpa, no, i’m not going to go to america,” and boy he’d feed me some good things you know.  	then when it got pretty close to time, i’d gradually get away from the chair and sneak around and head for the door and i’d get close to the door. i said, “grandpa, i’m going to america.” “you little son of a gun. you, i’m going to …” we’d go through that every time.  we’d go over there and he’d get me close and feed me the goodies then i’d scoot around and get to the door and say, “grandpa, i’m going to america.” “you little son of a gun.” he was a wonderful old man and at the … cathy:	why didn’t he want you to come to america? why do you think he didn’t want …? ebetino:	i was named after him. yeah, and so, his name was bauarelli and we’d go there quite a few … two or three nights a week, and then he’d ... had a … he’d said, “what? watch him. watch him sneak over and get over by that door, “grandpa, i’m going to america.” “you little so and so,” and we’d go through that every night we’d go over there. cathy:	you family close to your grandfather’s house.  ebetino:	we lived near because we walked. we had rooms close to there and of course, [inaudible 00:32:50] tell you reason why he came to the united states. i don’t know whether you want to put that’s separate but anyway, would you want it? i will say again, my line of thought done and … cathy:	what did your grandfather do? what did your grandfather work on?  ebetino:	he was a foreman with the count leone. he owned 25,000 acres. it was almost a [inaudible 00:33:29] because he was a count leone. at that time, they grew olives and grapes and nuts of all kinds. then they would ship them from terlizzi to naples for shipment overseas, especially a lot of olive oil.  	my grandfather and even my father and they had ... they had a gang of about five or six and they were pruners. they pruned the trees and fruit trees and got the most and got the best kind of fruit that you could possibly get. this was [inaudible 00:34:18] count leone was a ... and he  paid them a lot better than most italians at that time because that was quite an art. 	but when he came, he came here in 1907 and he was ... like i told you, he was headed for california but since they were building the track and they paid wages, manual labor so he stayed there and i’m glad we did.     cathy:	now when the family left italy and when you came with your mother and your family, did your grandparents see you off?  ebetino:	well, they seen us off to the train in terlizzi ... i mean bari. cathy:	tell me about your train trip in bari as you were coming to naples to meet the ship. ebetino:	we ... [inaudible 00:35:16]. between bari and naples, we had to go along some mountains and you look down there and cows about that big and horses and they were ... they would be shipped all over there. the different fruits and they ... cathy:	how long did your train trip take? how long were you on the train from bari to naples? ebetino:	from bari to naples, we was ... oh, i think it was about ... 14 hours  i think it took the train to go there. then we had to go to ... that’s where we boarded the boat and come to the mediterranean and through gibraltar and that’s where i told you we had it ... and the trip was rougher and it just ... we’ll i told you before.    cathy:	what did you pack to take with you? ebetino:	ma-am. cathy:	what did you pack to take with you?  ebetino:	mostly it was regular clothing and pants and shirt and we was lucky my mother was a pretty good seamstress. she made most of the clothes. the other stuff, we had to buy.  cathy:	did your mother take food with her? did your mother take any food with her on the journey? did she take any food? ebetino:	yeah, well, they’d make some and it was all cookies and stuff that would last. of course, the trip was so rough, it was rough all the way. like i say, we took a day ... we were a day and a half ... yeah, a day and a half late coming in the ... here in ellis island.  cathy:	did your dad send you money for the trip? ebetino:	oh, yeah, he sent us money. yeah, he’d send us american money and changed into lira, it was quite a lot so we lived pretty good. he was only making a dollar and a quarter an hour ... a day. a dollar and a quarter a day and they thought that was ... 1907, that was big wages.   cathy:	tell me about when you got settled in america with your father and your mother, you went on to be a golf pro. can you tell me about your life, some of your accomplishments? some of the people, interesting people that you met.   ebetino:	like i told you that i lived close to the golf course, so from six years old, i was out hanging around  just get balls. i would ... then i got to caddie when you were about 12. got to caddie and that ... and then i would chase balls for the ... the pro gave lessons and i’d run up and get them and bring them back. he always liked me because i would get the balls back and the guys taking lessons were glad they get to hit more balls.  	then he liked me and he told me, “would you like to work? and the pro shop had two club makers because the clubs in those days were all wooden shaft. they would break and they had two club makers there working all the time, fixing ... putting new shafts on clubs, making woods and making sets of ... match sets of clubs for certain guys that want to spend a little more money.  	in fact, george bush’s wife was ... they lived about midway on the first hole up on the hillside looking down. that was there and then i worked there until i was ... i caddied and ... cathy:	did you meet president bush?  ebetino:	yes.  cathy:	can you tell me about that? ebetino:	yeah, well, we met general bush, or president bush. he wasn’t president then at that time but he was in politics just starting and a very nice guy. he went ... where we lived in fairborn ohio and when president bush was running, he ... when he ran for presidency, he was coming in through brookville, which was my wife’s hometown.  	he gave a talk and we ... i was along the side of the rope line. he came in from this way, made his speech and then he walked out and walked up right to people. elizabeth and i both got to ... both shook hands with him. he was one of three presidents that i had personal contact with.   cathy:	who were the other presidents that you met?  ebetino:	well, there was bush and reagan and then of course, eisenhower. see, i’d given eisenhower ... played with him and gave him a lesson but eisenhower came when i was ... later there was a job open in dayton. i went and worked in dayton and then got to work on patterson, wright-patterson air force base.   cathy:	was president eisenhower a good student? ebetino:	yeah and i ... he came to wright field there in dayton and this colonel was showing him around. at that time, the air corps wasn’t a corps, it was this separate little until the war started. he was here, bush was ... eisenhower rather was there to oversee how the air corps was coming along.  	somebody ... he liked golf and somebody asked him, “colonel,” he says, he goes, “how is your golf game?” “oh,” he says, “it’s pretty good,” he said, “but my putting is stink-o,” he says, “it’s bad.” this major told him, he says, “we’ve got a pro here that has a reputation for a pretty good putter. would you...” he says, “maybe you ought to go see him.” 	they called me and they said ... this major call and say, he says, “colonel eisenhower is here and he’s having trouble with his putting.  when could you see him?” i said, “well, [inaudible 00:44:09] come here he can come whenever.”  	so he did. he came over and we were on the putting green for about an hour and got his putting straightened out. he was picking up the club too much. his center and straight back and straight through. i helped him and he ... at that time, he gave me $2 and i kept those $2 for quite a while. then of course, we met with bush.         cathy:	what was president reagan like? how did you meet president reagan? ebetino:	well, he came to speak in fairborn in greene county in dayton. he was out there and we ... he was ... let see, the next one was very ... well, i was on the republican committee in dayton there to meet with him. we had the part of the interstate ... the part of the high ... the super highway and the thing, which 275 now in dayton. it just stopped just about after it got to the field there because people in beavercreek, the interstate had to go through some trees and they didn’t like the idea of cutting them all down and making the highway through there.  	this went on for about six years. they kept back and forth and the mayor in dayton, he wanted the interstate to come right through the town, right through the city and that’s what they did. they put it through and the people hollered, they [inaudible 00:46:50] for our people to come down there. he says, “that dayton’s the worst place ... he was mayor and he got them to ...  	now they’d built 675 and that’s where i met with bush. we met with him and we talked with him about it. it’s a shame that they didn’t go ahead with this and he said, “well,” he said, “i can promise you people that if reagan was elected that we would see that it was done,” and that’s what happened. 	as soon as reagan got in and bush was the vice president [inaudible 00:47:35] he says, “it’s a darn shame.” he says, “it’s going to cost about three times more to build it now than if we had built it,” and yet ... they put it right down through the middle of dayton [inaudible 00:47:51].   cathy:	mr. ebetino, your wife was telling me that you also knew al capone.  ebetino:	oh, yeah, well ... cathy:	can you tell me something about that?
