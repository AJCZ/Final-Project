muller:	well i was i was getting pretty good at making frames other all cut out things yes. paul:		like picture frames? muller:	yes, and they were all fancy. and i-- was sitting there saw with the high that high that up and down and then over that that much.  paul:		yes, five six feet. muller:	like that and then i used to go and add more wood [inaudible 00:30:38] see yes.  paul:	now were you able to be apprenticed to a carpenter at some point? muller:	probably maybe that was the reason that i came to american and if somebody had started some carpenter or carpenters had started something. and then they said to me i you we’ll teach you how to become but you’ve got to keep this place clean in when we come in the morning has to be clean and so forth but there wasn’t anything all these other kids and i [inaudible 00:31:22] until here. “what we going to do”. so my father has gone to america and almost all the other fathers in their village had gone to america. and there was plenty work. and then this other kid he was almost a year older than me. he had somebody build him a toolbox in norway and then and then he had a couple of things maybe hammer or something. so then okay let’s go to america then. so then he had easy way to get money because they had more than us and they --i on the boat and then i-- wasn’t easy for me but anyway so  paul:		what wasn’t easy for you? muller:	to get that 125 paul:		how did you do it? muller:	yes i been, i suppose, my mother wrote to america or me and tell them-- so yes.  he was going to borrow money from somebody he knew and send it on to me so i could go over there go to america.  paul:		where was your father living in america?

muller:	except for a great land. a great land and maybe i may i had somebody told me america you can drink milk and you can eat eggs there was no-- you couldn’t do things like that over here. piece of bread going to my mother when i’m hungry and she was making homemade it was homemade was special but anyway we lived mostly on bread and [inaudible 00:35:41] then a little tiny little bit of sugar that was it. paul:		and you make a meal out of that. muller:	that was a meal. paul:		what was the name of your friend who went with you to america? muller:	earling samuelson. paul:		can you spell his name please? muller:	e-a-r-l-i-n-g   s-a-m-u-e-l-s-e-n.  paul:		and was he-- why did he want to go to america? muller:	his father also had gone to america but his father was a land man and he was in the shipyard them days there plenty of work during the war first world war. the he was an architect for the boats. so he had maybe twice as much pay as my father. so they were rather well to do compared to us. but they-- he was laid off too, everybody was laid off. so they just about all went to america.  paul:	but you said before the whole town all the fathers had gone to america. muller:	yes. paul:	that’s interesting. how did your mother feel about you going to america? muller:	somehow we must have gotten it into my head this other kid and i he was maybe almost maybe a year older my dad say we were going to go to america and sure enough oh yes, then then of course he had gotten his money from his father i don’t know his father had money, maybe borrowed and sent it home to him and i was waiting and waiting and the day come closer and closer. and then then then one day or two days was the best had to go to town to pay for the ticket then we could go was long take the boat to america.  time went by and by and no money couldn’t go. so my aunt onina she heard that an elderly lady over there, her youngest boy had gone to america also so he had a big brother and then she had that old lady had gotten a big check from her youngest son that had gone to america. and just 100 that we needed and aunt onina went over there to that lady and asked if she could borrow so that she could give it to me for the time being and so that i could go town and pay for the tickets sure, “sure  here’s the money”. the day money came was the same day that the man come with the money so i went i went right back and gave it to her and she gave it to her right away. paul:	okay right on. what was the name of the aunt?

[inaudible 00:41:42] so we got into a hotel and we got to stay the whole night and i think we stayed for two nights but anyway compared to poor the poor the people of the way where i come [inaudible 00:42:05] but anyway then then--. paul:	what did you think when you saw the ship that you were about to get on? had you been on a big ship before? muller:	no. paul:	so what were you thinking when you saw the ship that you had to board? muller:	you see now, yes i think i think around early in the night the next day we went out in the ocean in the dark in oslo christiani and we saw the boat i’m quite sure and then and then wasn’t so terribly big, not that boat but was rolling plenty and diving up and down like that. paul:		what was the name of the boat?

muller:	i think it was 12 days. paul:		and did the ship stop anywhere else? muller:	the first stop was way up and north of america there it belong to it belong there was-- canada owned that city but now i don’t remember that city but it was right out in the point here that’s where the big boats used to come in and then see we wasn’t allowed to get off the boat.  and then we went a little bit from there on we went down to i think it was [inaudible 00:46:08] the start norway of course and then and then we had to take off some stuff from [inaudible 00:46:20] and i remember our boys they have come there was going to america.  they must have a little money little money out to the boys on the dock. paul:	what-- do you have any stories that you would like to tell about being on the ship? muller:	yes. here's the rear end and here's the bow. earling and i was--oh yes we used to go all the way in the back and when the when the bow went down and-- paul:		okay so when the when the bow went down--  muller:	the bow went down and they just turn off and we used to like to go back there on the stern because off the water in the propeller make a terrible lot of noise and shake in the back and the boat. we didn’t think anything would go wrong but something could have. but it was rolling and so forth i will never forget that enormous shaking when the stern went up above the water with the propeller fast like that. paul:		can you describe for me where you slept on the ship? muller:	we were—i think i think there was enough was it eight i think eight guys in that little place and my mind was at first then another one here and there was these three walls there and then was an old man and he was even says he’s cousin to my mother and he was i can she said take good care of my boy and so forth but anyway. paul:	there were eight men in this in this room what king of beds did you have? muller:	[inaudible 00:48:51]. paul:		so you were like stacked on top of each other. muller:	yes, one here two here two here. so how could it be more than six because there was a door but i don’t know i thought there was eight but anyway--?  paul:		did you have a pothole in your bedroom? muller:	happened in my wall my bed there was one and i could open it and look out and i could see boat going fast along like that. paul:		where did they feed you on the ship?  muller:	a nice dining room food, much fancier than we had ever seen. paul:		what did you remember about the [inaudible 00:48:38]? muller:	milk all the eggs we want and good food and good dinners everything a1 amazing and we came to america same thing .the norwegians they had a long room much longer than from here to there. paul:		that’s 25 feet.  muller:	and we used to sit on both sides. paul:		did they feed you on any kinds of food that muller:	used to be all norwegians stuff but very good and lots of it meat we could hardly ever get meat all kinds of cake and coffee and milk. it was like a king’s place compared to the way we grow up. paul:		you said you celebrated your 16th birthday on the ship. muller:	i sure did. paul:		did-- how did you celebrate your birthday on the ship? muller:	i opened the package that my mum-- paul:		and that had the necktie  georg:	a necktie and what else?  paul:		a necktie and you told me. i forgot. muller:	necktie and -- paul:		socks no, cookies food. muller: 	candy some very good norwegian candy couple of things and i hadn’t opened the package.  paul:		you were a good boy. muller:	i wasn’t allowed to and i didn’t do it. but there was a lot of candy was expensive but anyway-- paul:		what about earling? what’s he doing on the ship?  muller:	earling. he didn’t do-- he didn’t get seasick. and he and he one day i was seasick i was up in the deck still and [inaudible 00:50:00] and then and then one day earling came up we’re going to have salt fish for dinner sword fish was the best thing we could get in norway.  sword fish and potatoes of course so then i just decided and he comes up with a big plate with sword fish and potatoes in there. and you know oh it tasted so super-duper, no more no more no more sea sickness, no more, was all gone and i never forget that dinner my friend came up with for me, never forget it. paul:		did you see the captain of the ship while you were on the boat? muller:	there was-- that-- that was after we got married we went home and came back then there was a captain’s dinner for us and  then and he was there.  paul:		so that’s a different, that’s a different voyage was a later voyage. muller:	go home was different many years later 9 10 years later but then we he was there. the boss i mean the captain i’m sure he was there but [inaudible 00:53:32] short tiny thing but he was there, paul:		someone had been driving the boat so he must have been there. muller:	yes he was there and nice people they were so nice. paul:	were they all norwegians travelling? were they mostly norwegian people? muller:	yes unless they had had been out earlier had got some norwegians and gone to norway but because those boats were packed all the time all the people going to america. paul:	and you said earlier how much did the voyage cost? i just would you to repeat that. muller:	$125. paul:		and how much in norwegian money how much was that? muller:	that was probably about almost 600. paul:	and did you-- how did you get you steam ship ticket where did you have to get that? muller:	arendal, the city of arendal we used to go by boat. down the coast to go to arendal and there you could buy you had the money write out the ticket like that. was it funny money you can do a lot of things. paul:	right, right. do you remember seeing the stature of liberty when the ship came into new york harbor? muller:	yes we were told the statue of liberty oh statue of liberty yes oh yes that was right there where the boats go? paul:	then tell me what happened to you, the ship came into new york harbor  muller:	yes. paul:		and it-- how did you get to ellis island from the ship. muller:	yes, well we came on a sunday, and then and then this little boat from the place-- paul:		the little ferry boat or something muller:	what did they call?  paul:		ellis island? muller:	ellis island they didn’t work that little boat didn't work on sunday. so we had an extra night on the boat and early next morning early that boat came and we came around and there was somebody standing there yes writing paper and do you have. we had to have somebody from 100 feet away maybe. and we could see we looked good there was my father. he was standing there waiting for me to get my papers okay so that i could go and then they asked a question do you have-- someone now waiting for you over there? okay who is that? i guess we had to point him out and so forth. and sure enough, here’s your papers, you could go.  so i walked over there, sure my father standing there waiting for me and then we got off and began to southern manhattan then and we went and did a whole lot of down to the subway and then we went on so train came and then we went in there they opened we go in there my father and i yes. and started off again we then we’re going to go to over brooklyn and then underneath the water, deep underneath the water. “well”, says my father. “we are in the ocean now”. how can how can the thing go in the ocean? place we didn’t get wet or anything about go all over new york with the subway coming. paul:	how did you feel when you saw your father? when you when you recognized your father? muller:	it wasn’t it wasn’t so long before i seeing was it 24? he probably had been here maybe a year or so?  paul:		so you had seen him just not so long ago. muller:	yes, no so long ago. paul:	at ellis island did you have to go any kind of medical examination? muller:	yes, there was. [inaudible 00:58:12] in oslo too they had to look anything there. so when we came here they did the same thing. and as far i remember saw anything in my hair they didn’t tell me that they saw anything in my hair paul:		and did they ask. muller:	you know what i can remember? i thought there was. there was two men and a girl going to america. somehow they had they had gotten to one another and sure enough they got caught. first i know they had to get married before they could come to america. paul:		they caught them at ellis island. muller:	they caught them in ellis island. paul:	we’re going to pause for a second and i’m going to put another tape in the machine and then we’ll begin your life in new york. okay we are now beginning tape two with muller muller who came from norway in 1924 when he was 16 years old. and again i will say i am in greenfield centre in new york that we are in mr. muller’s house you’re going to hear chiming clocks there are several of them and there are family members that you may hear in the background. there’s also a wood stove near us which will probably crackle on the recording.  your family has asked me to ask you about the fish in norway. there was a good story that we kind of lost over. so can you tell me about the fishing in norway? muller:	my first fishing was the brook that was run through our village and out into the ocean. and i used to-- six years old maybe? and like the other boys and we made a line like that here that and they put it away underneath some bushes or something one here and one there walking so that was the beginning of my fishing. but after that, then then of course then i used to go and a couple of times.  my father didn’t like to go fishing at all. but i was crazy about it. anyway so then of course by and by i went myself way out in the ocean and of course. we didn’t have no boat them days. we didn’t have boat so i came home after about 10 years in in america then i could buy my own boat and so forth then i sailed and i went way out. paul:		so who’s boat was it who’s did you did you use? muller:	that was my boat that i boat when i came home.  paul:		that was the boat when you came—  muller:	otherwise i remember one guy saying to me, he had a boat. so if [inaudible 01:01:21], was the beginning of rotary in norway. so you do that for me, you can take my boat anytime you want to. but the-- so i did but i remember one time he wanted to go fishing his boat wasn’t there because i was out in the ocean but anyway i was  allowed to use his boat and i thought that was super. we were too poor to have a boat before i got too old and i came back from america  paul:		how many fish did you catch? muller:	codfish that’s what we liked the best. codfish. paul:		and how was the codfish prepared? muller:	cooked, then my mother cooked it, not too much but enough. and then we had cooked fish and a little bit of america margarine for sauce and then some potatoes. paul:	how did you catch the cod from the boat, what method did you use to catch the cod? muller:	lines. long lines that could go down to the bottom and we have everything down there. and then line like this yes in there and then we went to the bottom because that’s where the fish is near the bottom. so we pulled not so much until maybe the hook with something else. so anyway that’s where we could sometimes we had some shiny, quite big hooks with like this that was-- paul:		curved. muller:	yes curved and then we could sit like that a little bit and it looked like a shiny fish the rest of the hook where the hook was in this anyway so -- paul:		so that would fool the cod into thinking that was a baby fish? muller:	sure, he goes first like that and comes and they caught with a big mouth and then they grab it and then of course catch fish like that beautiful, beautiful, and beautiful. paul:		how do you clean a cord when you catch it? muller:	you just take it home. some of do it right there on the boat or the ocean cut open and that was in the river that cooked with the fish liver but anyway never forget we couldn’t have cooked with the fish and a little bit of but anyway in not and we had never we couldn’t have cooked fish and a little bit of not real butter.  paul:		the margarine. muller:	i’ve never in my life had ever i tasted the real margarine real butter never before we i came to america. paul:	but we should try and get you back to america. we’ve digressed a little bit. let me just recap. you come into new york you went through the process at ellis island, you met your father at ellis island and to brooklyn. how did you spend your first night in america? muller:	i came home in the afternoon say, somewhere in the afternoon. well, i suppose we went so some place to eat see and then. and there was the next day but saying i don’t know my father said we had to go to clothes seller. because had old country clothes, funny clothes. paul:	let me ask you about that. what clothes were you wearing when you met your father on ellis island?  muller:	were they clothes. paul:	 	describe your clothes? muller:	maybe fortunate to have a jacket down here and then and then and then a sweater maybe and a shirt and then of course we got two [inaudible 01:05:47] on the deck. earling quite around then we went down and we felt good we were in good shape and so forth. paul:		so your father took you to buy new clothes? muller:	the next day. paul:		what did he buy for you? muller:	i was surprised because why i got clothes. “no, you got to be like everybody else or they will look at you”. and i could sit here and there was this street here and the boys used to play ball on the street. i could sit here and i wish i wish i could go out like that i didn’t what they were saying even ask them. wouldn’t know what to say? paul:		where did your father live in brooklyn? muller:	555555th street and also 555755th street we lived  paul:	the first place your father took you your first night in america, can you tell me what kind of a structure it was.  muller:	he only had something they call a hole home. a little bit of a home. there was just one enough for a bed maybe like that but you know something we both slept on that bed the first night and then after that i guess the lady in the house had a bigger bed for us.  paul:		so he was living in a boarding house? muller:	of course i slept like a log i don’t see how my father could sleep. paul:	you gestured that the bed was roughly three and a half feet wide or so. smaller? yes barely three feet wide.  muller:	i was tired i suppose of the trip and i slept like a log but i could understand my father because the next day i’m sure that he spoke to the lady and got a bigger room.  paul:	got a bigger room. explain to me a little bit about what the relationship was like with your father when you first came here. muller:	fine it was okay. but i tell you something. and elizabeth but anyway so, so the time went on and on and everybody taken all the men taken all their families, not all but most had taken their family over to america. they borrowed money or made money or whatever but then, i never forget it, i never forget it. my father comes with his hand like that.  well what’s the matter? i got to have your money couldn’t take my family to america. and my younger brother tells me the story well he was the only kid he was only one year month one year old when i left the whole country. so he was thought he was going to get my i sent $4000 so i said no. “i'm not going to pay for—“then my younger brother said to me, forget about america i don’t have the got the money but i wasn’t going to give the money because most likely i would have been supporting. even though i didn’t work in a regular carpenter at that time, i had work.   i wouldn’t have been able to save anything. but of course i guess my mother had made arrangements according to my younger brother that they were going to go to america.  when came from america no, you can’t take them i don’t have the money. and then they never went to america mu mother never liked in america and she was here and she lived downtown brooklyn and in them days it was terribly hot and house close to one another and she didn’t like it and there was funny people there and so on and so forth. so if she was here a few years then she went back home she was glad to be back home. she wouldn’t like to come back to america would have been a waste of money. paul:		what year did she first come over? muller:	that must have been, let’s see. my father went to america and then she came maybe a year a year and a half after-- paul:		so it’s before you were born? muller:	long before. paul:	long before and she just didn’t like it and she went back. she didn't want to go to montana because of the indian she was happier in norway and--. paul:	tell me a little bit of the neighborhood that you lived in in brooklyn. what kinds of people lived in the neighborhood? muller:	when i came to america? paul:		yes. muller:	nice, the street was nice and there was a guy who came up with a thing and he swept along the sidewalks and kept had machinery doing it by itself like that. and then then of course we had gas lights out there. and the guys who used to come had a long stick and stopped there and he turned on the lights in the morning, then he came back before dark and he turned it on again. that’s how it was then.  paul:		did you have gas lights in your apartment?  muller:	i think i think there was but i don’t know gas lights but must have been wasn’t too long after electricity, not too long. paul:	but you remember the gas lights on the street light the street lamps being installed the gas. muller:	yes this man that was his job go up and down the street like that. paul:	what are some of the other things about the neighborhood that stick in your mind do you remember like a store? muller:	do you know what. i was used to work hard, working hard. [inaudible 01:12:16]  up and down barefooted in the sandy roads so what was i--? paul:	we were talking about the things that you saw in the neighborhood like things that stick out in your mind that you remember. maybe a store that you used to go to or a restaurant that you used to go to that were right near where you lived. muller:	yes, i remember my father saying, “maybe today we’re going down to the place on the corner down 55th street, they sell men's clothes”. so then he bought be nice brown set of clothes poor guy he didn’t have any money but i was a kid.  paul:		tell me about how you learned english. muller:	yes, within a year, i could understand anything people were telling me on the job specifically because there was more norwegians on the job we talked our own language but anyway, i could understand everything. paul:		was this the first job that you got in the shoe store? muller:	yes helping. i had to clean the floor and so forth and take care of things. paul:	do you remember what your first word in english was that you understood? muller:	maybe yes, maybe yes and no maybe something like that. paul:	did you did you ever remember making a mistake trying to say one word and saying something else that sticks out in your mind? muller:	i can’t remember, how make mistakes i can’t. and then i got to work with the painter that used to paint [inaudible 01:14:24] he i remember he drunk soda like another person another guy same name and me guy has kids for some reason because i came from my family but anyway, he told us about-- he had such a nice daughter but that’s it maybe she came to visit her father.  maybe once in the shop there he was fixing-- doing the painting and so forth but anyway was a very nice guy and his parents as far as i remember they were german they came from germany and he liked those guys they were good people from the old country. george was born in america with norwegian parents. so he could he could talk norwegian just as good as my wife my wife was my wife was norwegian parents.  that's all they talked in the house. she could read and write and talk just as good as me. what i said to my daughter that i wish that elizabeth her mother had talked norwegian to you so that you could learn her language just like i did just like there was nothing to it. english came by itself and by and by i make all kinds of mistakes even today when i write english, but i’m not particular anymore. paul:		did your father speak english? muller:	he could talk to people.  paul:	 	of course he had been here so much longer muller:	within a year, i could get along okay. paul:		tell me how you became a carpenter? that whole process. muller:	so the next day i guess it was i don’t think it was the same day, “dad i got to have a job.” “what's the matter, dude you just came take it easy will you, no i don’t want to take it easy, and i want a job”. sure enough he takes me down to hammerton on 14 street because he knew [inaudible 01:16:57] even from our village in the old country. he brother had a shop there and he had by that time started to make shoes for some big company well he didn't care much for me i was 16 years old then never had any experience this and that but somehow said, okay.  so the next day, i went to work and got along fine he couldn’t speak norwegian he was from german people and then then george nicolson yes he could speak norwegian just as good as me and had never been in norway. but they were norwegian parents so what we had a good real time lunch hour half hour talk about things like that i could understand all they were talking about. very interesting nine years. then mum and i got married know this girls parents and she could speak norwegian just as good as me.  paul:		what was her name? muller:	esther. paul:	and what was her maiden name? let me fix your microphone you keep pulling it down. you can say her name elizabeth. muller:	that was esther. hey mum? elizabeth?  paul:		you can say. elizabeth:	 trulsen paul:	and when you first met esther what was it about esther that you liked? muller:	well let’s see. let’s see now. she--we went to same church and her parents came there with the two girls esther and the young girl two years younger and they were good looking and so forth there was in years. paul:	what was your first date with esther? where did you go for the very first time? muller:	i think there was different boy that walked esther home from church because but [inaudible 01:19:41] was not serious [inaudible 01:19:46] like it is today so there wasn’t so now even they write to me from norway you cannot go out after dark. this is what my sister wrote to me. paul:		but you used to walk with esther. muller:	i used to walk home all the time. she had they had a nice one family home on 80 state and between 10th and 11th  avenue very nice so one day i don’t know week or two george i would like to take you in the house and meet my mother and father. i felt it was funny but i did go ahead and beautiful find whole house like this beautiful. norwegian people are very particular so most of them. paul:	her parents were born in norway but she was born in the united states. muller:	yes.  paul:	did you speak english with esther or did you speak norwegian with her? muller:	well at that time-- by that time i think that i had done fairly good but i think that mum would rather speak norwegian but she could speak, read and write just as good as me.  paul:		what year did you get married? muller:	33 paul:		1933. muller:	and one week later we went to norway and we stayed in norway one year-- no two years. paul:		did you see your mother when you went 1933? muller:	oh yes. paul:	tell me what it was like, as that the first time you had been back to norway? paul:	tell me what. tell me what it felt like to see your mother after that time. muller:	oh my was super. when mum had come to america to visit us kids and i’ll never forget what my mother told me that she said, can you here liz? elizabeth:	yes. muller:	my mum also said to liz that the doctor in norway said about her, about my mother and [foreign 01:22:17] they think probably that my mum need oil for her stomach there’s no stomach soft as what do they call it. bellies paul:		like liquid, juice.  muller:	there’s no there’s no mother that’s belly there’s no in  paul:		your stomach  muller:	stomach. i’ll never forget that. and then i wouldn’t be surprised i have taken something like that because i have taken something that i take a little bit with food and it keeps my stomach nice paul:		did you ever consider moving back to norway to live? muller:	well, i tell you one thing. i said who was it i said that to-- was it yesterday today. yesterday i think it was. but now i can remember who i said it to but i said oh yes i was sitting beside somebody in [inaudible 01:23:50] i hadn’t had elizabeth, i could just well have gone right home i could have gone right home.  paul:		can you can you name the children that you had for me please?

elizabeth:	you sure do. muller:	yes. i stay healthy. paul:	i should say for the sake of the tape, that mr. muller is referring to elizabeth which is fine, which is okay, just for the transcriber’s sake so they’ll know to put elizabeth instead of voice of mic.  tell me about, i want you talk a little bit before we end and we do have to end soon a little bit about your profession as a carpenter in your later years? how that happened and what kinds of things you made?  muller:	i got a job in in [inaudible 01:25:49] was edmund [inaudible 01:25:55] his brother was the foreman. paul:		and this was in brooklyn?  muller:	this was in brooklyn yes. and then me they didn’t know if i had [inaudible 01:26:06] to done the trade but i was so interested in being in learning the carpenter trade that was my everything and sure enough i started, i got a job and of course i could stay a little late sometimes and make something for myself. and of course edmund have say there is he must he must have said there’s a guy that going to go far and i did.  one with $11 a week and not a dollar not a dollar, pretty soon within 4 years or so i was right up there, full pay. and then how old was i then?

we are looking at some norwegian books that mr. muller is showing me. yes, this is a norwegian bible. muller:	i like that best.  the best english i use my own. paul:	but you yourself do you consider yourself norwegian or american?
