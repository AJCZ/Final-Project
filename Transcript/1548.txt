SENNA: Oh yeah, you have to keep some. LEVINE: Do you remember what things you wanted to hold on to from Portugal? SENNA: I tell you, I didn't because my mother and my father say, "Stay with your friends and with each other, and never forget each other." That's why I like to remember that. I never forget my family and especially my brothers and sisters. We're very close with each other. LEVINE: And did you stay religious? Did you keep up the religion? SENNA: Oh yeah, we were religious. I still religious. Oh yeah. I light my candle all the time. I go to church. My kids are all the same way, too. My children are all religious. LEVINE: Now what do you light the candles for? SENNA: For everybody. LEVINE: In church, you mean. SENNA: Yeah, in church. I light my house candles, too. Because they used to do that in the old country and I want to keep it up. LEVINE: Is that in memory of people who have died? Is that... SENNA: Yeah, they die and the living, too. LEVINE: Oh, and the living, too. And how about English? Was it difficult for you to learn English? How did you learn it? SENNA: Oh yeah. I didn't go to school, I tell you because I didn't have the time to go to school. When you're raising kids you have so many places to go back and forth, you just talk! Then my kids go to school, taught me English. (she laughs) LEVINE: Did your kids teach you English? SENNA: Oh yeah, I talk with the kids and my kids don't talk Portugese much, you know. LEVINE: They don't? SENNA: No, they should. (?) The young ones, it doesn't matter. LEVINE: Did you speak Portugese with your husband at home? SENNA: Yeah. We speak Portugese with the kids, but they pay no attention. Very, very little. LEVINE: How did you feel, were you happy being here in America or did you want to go back? SENNA: No. I didn't want to go back. I have a mother. Then after my mother died, then I stay. Is my country. I never forget because I was born in that country. Is my country. But I knew more American because I lived more years in this country than in my country. Then I have all my kids, my grandchildren. That's my country. LEVINE: And did you want your children to become American or did you want them to hold on to the fact that they had a Portugese heritage? SENNA: Oh yeah. The kids never forget about the experience of Portugese but they never want to go back in old country, either. LEVINE: Well, is there anything else that you can think of that you might want to say about, you know, being born in Portugal and coming here, and what your life's been like? SENNA: No, no, my life has been pretty good, I guess. I have a husband and then I have my kids, that's all-- my family. That's my life. LEVINE: Well, sounds like you've had a very good and rich life. SENNA: Yeah. That's it. You're right. Yeah. You don't need to be rich sometime to be happy. LEVINE: No. No, I don't mean rich in terms of money. SENNA: I know, but sometimes, a lot of people say, oh to be rich, but sometimes we be rich and we're not happy either. Is no good either. LEVINE: That's right. Well, you're riches are in your children, I think. SENNA: I know, I know. My life is my kids and my grandchildren and my family. LEVINE: Uh-huh, uh-huh. SENNA: I like people. I like everybody. I have a lot of friends, young kids and all kids. All kinds. LEVINE: Really? SENNA: Yeah. My grandchildren's, all of his friends all call me "Ma." All call, some call me "Grandma." I say I have a lot of them. LEVINE: And are you enjoying your old age? SENNA: My age, yeah, yeah, alright. LEVINE: You're not ill and you feel okay. SENNA: No. Thanks to God. I do pretty well with my age. I'm now eighty-three. LEVINE: Okay, maybe we can stop here and I want to thank you. It was very interesting talking to you. SENNA: Thank you very much. Do you want a cup of tea? LEVINE: Yeah, I would like one. Okay, this is Janet Levine signing off for the National Park Service and it's June 25, 1992 and I've been here with Benvinda Senna.
