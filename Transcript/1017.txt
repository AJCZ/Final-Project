[inaudible 00:01:33]. elisa:	your name was changed to louis lorch? louis:	from what i was told, my name was changed to louis lorch when we arrived from germany in the united states by our uncle who sponsored us.   elisa:	lorch, your name when you came through? lorch:	my name was heinz, h-e-i-n-z. that was also changed immediately after landing in the states.  elisa:	i’d like to start out by talking about where you came from, the town that you came from. lorch, why don’t you start? if there’s anything you can remember about what the town looked like when you were growing up, what size?  lorch:	well, it was small. the town was dieburg, d-i-e-b-u-r-g. it was about 20 miles out of frankfurt. it was near towns like darmstadt. i remember living in a house, a three-story house with a very, very large backyard and we also had an outhouse. we didn’t have a bathroom in the house, so we had to walk across the yard to get to the bathroom.  	my father owned or had, with his brother a livestock business dealing in cattle where he bought cattle and brought them back home again and then took them to the slaughterhouse. i still remember going to the slaughterhouse with him. he let me even lead cows through the streets into the slaughterhouse and watched them get slaughtered and skinned and all. do you want me to go through the whole process or what? elisa:	what major industry was that town? if there was one... lorch:	that i don’t know. there were a lot of butchers in town, a lot of people dealing in livestock that i know. there were... elisa:	your father would raise the cattle? lorch:	no, no, no, he would not. he would go to market like a place like i mentioned, darmstadt and would have had large buildings i remember with stalls to the side. we could walk around where the farmers would bring in their cattle and he would bargain and select cows that he would want to buy.  he couldn’t drive because he only had one arm so he used to rent or at least a truck with a driver. he used to buy seven, eight, ten cows, put them into the truck and bring them back home again. his brother or stepbrother had a house...      elisa:	what is his name? lorch:	hugo lorch. they were partners in business. he had a barn in the back of his house where they used to store the cattle for three, four days, whatever it was, milk them every day and then taken them to a slaughterhouse to be slaughtered. then they sold, that’s how they...   elisa:	so he was kind the middleman? lorch:	he was more less the middleman, yeah, in the livestock business, yeah.  elisa:	what can you tell about your father? what did he look like? can you give a description of your father for the tape and what his name was as well? lorch:	well, his name was max lorch. there were actually three max lorchs in town, max lorch 1, max lorch 2 and max lorch 3. he was max lorch 3, that’s how they distinguished among themselves. he was average. he lost his right arm right above the elbow in the first world war. i think it was 1919 when that happened.    elisa:	do you anything about that story, how he lost his arm? lorch:	to my knowledge, he lost it in france. how he lost it, he never really spoke about it. i know we very seldom saw the arm, saw the stub. you’d see it a few times. he never wore ... he had an arm, an artificial arm, which he very rarely wore.   elisa:	how tall was he? lorch:	maybe 5’8’’, he was not a tall man but he was average. he was not heavy in any way. he was never fat, he was always nice and lean, and a very hardworking man, a very religious man. the story that i got from people was that when he was wounded, he prayed to god saying that if god would spare his life, he would devout his life to the religion, to god, which he did. he was, i said, a very religious man, he never worked on a saturday, never worked on the holidays, prayed every day but he never ... he was religious within himself. he never forced his religion on anyone else. that was his philosophy.    elisa:	can you describe for me your mother? can you tell me what she looked like? if there’s any story you can remember about throughout your childhood here or before that you remember, just being a small child with your mother.  louis:	my mom ... it was so long ago and i’d lived such a short time with her. she passed away when i was 22. she was a good-looking woman. she was a...   elisa:	how tall was she?  louis:	5’5”, was a brunette and she had a very distinctive wart on her cheek that i remember her by so much. she was great cook and a great housekeeper. she liked having fun, she liked playing cards, she liked playing mahjong, she liked [inaudible 00:08:10] always wanted to be on the go.  unfortunately, she had a very tough life and she had very little time for us i would think during our smaller childhood when we came to the united states, my uncle who sponsored us owned a factory in town in hudson new york. as he was bringing ... we were the first ones he brought over.  he rented a large house in hudson. it was a four bedroom upstairs downstairs home. i would imagine it had to be 2,000 square feet total [inaudible 00:08:55] with an attic and a cellar.  	whoever came over from the old country, from germany or wherever they came from, france, they would stop at our place and stay with us until they found their own apartment. since he was the sponsor, he gave them jobs in the factory until they found their own niche.  	my mom had to cook for him. i can remember i think i was 12 years old before we sat down ... 12, 13 years old before we sat down at a table just the four kids and mom and dad. there was always boarders, we always had to eat in the kitchen and the boarders ate in the dining room.        elisa:	what did she make? louis:	cakes. oh, she was a great baker and she was a good cook. i mean normal stuff, it was not fancy cooking. we kept a kosher home.   elisa:	can you tell me a typical meal? just describe a typical meal.  louis:	meat and potatoes.  lorch:	soup, meat, potatoes.  louis:	soup, meat and potatoes. no bread and no drinks on the table except for [inaudible 00:10:01] to make the prayer over the bread. that’s the only time we had bread at the table and no drinks on the table. i will remember until this day, right.  lorch:	that was my father’s philosophy; you eat what your mother cooked and nothing else. you don’t fill up on any kind of a liquid or... louis:	she was a good cook. we didn’t starve in the house but she worked very hard. i can remember the coal stoves and the wood burning stoves and the coal furnaces and then finally we went to oil stoves. this is before we had iceboxes before we had refrigerators.     elisa:	what was her name?  louis:	[inaudible 00:10:39] she passed away on 19 ... new year’s eve of 1953.  elisa:	okay. lorch, why don’t you tell me the names of your sisters? we have the brothers here.   lorch:	okay, i have one sister who lives in east northport, long island. her name was ruth, her name was not changed. we had a sister in columbus ohio. her name is margo or margaret. originally, it was margot, m-a-r-g-o-t. that was her ... i don’t know if she still goes by that name or not. i guess she still does. we all call her maggie. that’s it, just two girls and two boys.       elisa:	do you remember your grandparents?  lorch:	vaguely, yes.  elisa:	what do you remember about them? what sticks in your mind? lorch:	my mother’s mother ... actually, everybody lived close by in this small town. every time we came, she always had candy for us. her husband, whose name was morris. he was in the hide business. i guess then that’s how everybody was connected with cattle some way.  he had the hide business. i remember he had a storage house back of his building, a big barn where he laid out all the hides to dry out i guess. i don’t remember too much. he reminds me of a thin kentucky colonel with a beard. he was a very distinguished looking man. i don’t remember too much about him. i remember how he looks but that’s about it. my father had a stepmother and i can’t say too much nice things about her, that’s the problem.        elisa:	well, you can say ... what was she like? tell me what she was like. it doesn’t always have to be...  lorch:	naturally she favored her two children. my father had a stepsister and a stepbrother.  elisa:	what were their names? lorch:	one was named gene and one was named hugo. that was who he was partners with. she didn’t like my mother too much as mother in laws go i guess. they was in each other’s hair. as i said, she ... i don’t remember her as being a nice grandmother.  elisa:	what was her name?  louis:	mina, not mina? lorch:	no, not minnie. i...
