Let's see. You were telling about the post office, about the telegraphy, the dot-dash. Tell us about what that was like. SCHMID: Dots and dashes, you know, dots and dashes. And it's outmoded now. They don't have it any more. LEVINE: But you learned that when you went to work in the post office? SCHMID: Yes, yes. I worked doing that, yes. LEVINE: And was that, did that, was that exciting?

LEVINE: Do you remember anything she told you before you came here? SCHMID: Well, she told me it was a nice country and she thought I'd like it very much, and that's all. But I think I've given you all that I have to give, I think so. I'm just getting over a cold, you know, yes. LEVINE: Okay. Then before we close is there anything that you remember particularly about Ellis Island? Do you remember the Great Hall? Do you remember when you came there before you met your sister? Do you remember being examined? SCHMID: No, I don't. No. LEVINE: And then, just briefly, what did you do for work when you came here then? SCHMID: Well, I went to work with my sister.

SCHMID: I did. ( A nurse enters the room. ) ( break in tape ) LEVINE: With Elizabeth Schmid, and we're going to close off now. Is there anything further you'd want to say, Elizabeth, about coming to this country or being in this country before we close?
