PHILLIPS: Okay. It is the 24th of March, 1988 [sic]. This is Andrew Phillips. This is Mary Vokaty, and I don't know whether that's in fact your name from Czechoslovakia. MARY VOKATY: Vokaty, yes. PHILLIPS: V-O-K-A-T-Y. MILDRED VOKATY: That's her married name. PHILLIPS: Right. Okay. And it's interview number 381 [DP-007]. It's coming on 2:30 here, and Mrs. Vokaty is in fact from Czechoslovakia. Perhaps we could start, Mrs. Vokaty, could you tell me what year you were born in? MARY VOKATY: 19 . . . MILDRED VOKATY: No, 1892. MARY VOKATY: 18, uh . . . PHILLIPS: 1892. MARY VOKATY: '92. PHILLIPS: Right. Could you tell me what year you immigrated to the United States? MARY VOKATY: 19, 1903, wasn't it? 1903. PHILLIPS: If you want to interject that's fine. Feel that it's . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Oh, all right, all right. MARY VOKATY: 1903. PHILLIPS: Right. Because really what others . . . MARY VOKATY: At Christmas time we were in New York. PHILLIPS: You were on Ellis Island? MARY VOKATY: Ellis Island. JOSEPH VOKATY: You were on Ellis Island . . . MARY VOKATY: Yeah. PHILLIPS: For Christmas. Right? In 1903. Okay. MARY VOKATY: We were there eight years, eight days, because my brother had a, his finger was broken when he was . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: It was amputated when he was . . . MARY VOKATY: Yes. And, uh, he didn't have this part, so for that they kept us. PHILLIPS: You were kept in quarantine. JOSEPH VOKATY: Yeah. PHILLIPS: What I'd like to do is perhaps have you go back to before you came to Ellis Island and have you tell me where you were born in Czechoslovakia. MARY VOKATY: Oh, sure. That I know. In, um, you want to know the village, or what? MILDRED VOKATY: Yes. MARY VOKATY: The village is Vrunavitza in the, Rokycany. The town Rokycany. And Plzen is the whole like . . . MILDRED VOKATY: The county seat? MARY VOKATY: The whole thing, yeah. JOSEPH VOKATY: It was close to Plzen. MARY VOKATY: Yeah. JOSEPH VOKATY: It's like a suburb of Plzen. MARY VOKATY: Yeah. PHILLIPS: Okay. Can you tell me what your parents did? What kind of work did they do? MARY VOKATY: Well, I'll tell you. My father was a miner and he was wounded in Europe and he, uh . . . MILDRED VOKATY: There was a key. MARY VOKATY: He had a broken hip and an ankle so he was on pension. And in between, while he was on pension, so he used to do all kinds of odd, he never was idle. And he cleaned the barn for men, and. MILDRED VOKATY: He made wooden shoes. MARY VOKATY: Oh, he made wooden shoes. You know, just the bottom and put leather over and it was a lot for his friends, not much money. He never got much money out of it. JOSEPH VOKATY: The shoes were sandal style. MARY VOKATY: Uh-huh. PHILLIPS: Tell me, what did he do for a living? How did he earn a living? Was he a farmer, or did he . . . MARY VOKATY: He was a miner. PHILLIPS: He was a miner. MARY VOKATY: He was a miner. MILDRED VOKATY: Until there was a cave-in. PHILLIPS: Right. I see. Okay. He was injured. MARY VOKATY: Until he was injured. MILDRED VOKATY: And there were a lot more men who were injured a lot less than he, but he asked that they all be taken out first. MARY VOKATY: He thought everybody was . . . MILDRED VOKATY: And he was the last one taken out. And my mother said that at one time the doctor came around and he sent prescrip, ah, my grandmother for a prescription. And before she got back home the doctor intercepted her and said, "Don't give that to him, that's poison." Because he had cancer very badly and so, but he outlived the cancer until he was here for several years. PHILLIPS: I see. Can I just, just give me a sense of what it was like for you, what was life like for you and your family back in Czechoslovakia? MARY VOKATY: What was what? MILDRED VOKATY: What was life like for you? You went to school, and you went to eat. MARY VOKATY: Oh, you know, in our village there isn't much that you can do. Go to school, that's about . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: When you used to go meet your father every day for lunch. MARY VOKATY: Oh, my, my father, when he was a miner, so I was about four or five years old, I used to meet him. JOSEPH VOKATY: She'd bring him lunch. MARY VOKATY: And he brought, he used to bring a little bit of bread, and he called it new bread, but he brought it from home. And the way he ate it in a pocket out of those little coals in it and he used to say that's new bread and I thought it was the best thing in the world, crunching with the coal in it. PHILLIPS: Coal in it. And what, how many people were in your family? How many children? MARY VOKATY: Oh, there is, uh, there is . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Three boys and two girls. MARY VOKATY: My sister and three brothers. PHILLIPS: Right. And what sort of house did you live in? ( background noise ) MARY VOKATY: It was, we still had the thatched roof and the walls were, uh . . . MILDRED VOKATY: About two feet wide. MARY VOKATY: Real wide. PHILLIPS: What were they made from? MARY VOKATY: Huh? PHILLIPS: What were they made from? MARY VOKATY: Oh, I think those were stones. I don't know. Stones, I think. Solid. PHILLIPS: Was it very cold in your house in the wintertime? What were the conditions like? Was it cold? MARY VOKATY: Oh, it was warm. It was warm. See, the house, the walls, everything, it kept in. And with the . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: And her clothes . . . MARY VOKATY: . . . and with the . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: How her skirts were. MARY VOKATY: In with the, in the stove, so that was all that it was heated with. MILDRED VOKATY: But, Mother, the back of the house was built against a hill, wasn't it? MARY VOKATY: Oh, yeah, our house was built right against the hill. And in the hill folks made like a cave and they kept butter and milk and all that stuff in it. PHILLIPS: I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your school life? What it was like going to school? For instance, how far was the school from your house? MARY VOKATY: Across the street. All I did was cross the street. MILDRED VOKATY: You had one teacher, didn't you? You had one teacher? MARY VOKATY: We had three rooms, the principal was, he taught two rooms and the second was taught by two- years, and the fourth was taught by four-years. PHILLIPS: Was it a very large school? It doesn't sound like it was very large. How many, how many students were at the school? MARY VOKATY: Oh, it was, I don't know, but it was quite a bit. PHILLIPS: At what, when did you learn, or when was it that your parents decided that they wanted to leave the village and travel to the United States. How did that occur? MARY VOKATY: Well, I don't know. MILDRED VOKATY: Well, some of it was because you're brothers were supposed to go into service. MARY VOKATY: You know, up there, all them fellows, so the fellows had to leave ahead of us to come here and they waited in, where did they wait? In New York or Ellis Island? MILDRED VOKATY: No, in Bremen, Germany. MARY VOKATY: Yeah, in Bremen, that's how he came. And, uh . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: The army was the Austria/Hungary service and that was prior to the World War, of course. MARY VOKATY: And then when we came here, so we met here in New York. MILDRED VOKATY: No, no, no, no. In Germany. You all came together on the ship. PHILLIPS: Let me just go back. Let me just take you back to the time before you left Czechoslovakia. Can you remember your parents talking about leaving and coming to the United States. Can you remember that? MARY VOKATY: Oh, well, sure. See, my folks thought if the, the boys wanted to come here anyway and they thought why be separated. So my father decided to come here, but of course my mother never liked it. She cried. She didn't like it. But as long as, to be, to get together, so she decided it was all right to come. PHILLIPS: So your brothers, in fact, were going to be inducted into the army. They were going to be drafted. MARY VOKATY: They would be. They would be. PHILLIPS: And your parents didn't want that to happen. MARY VOKATY: Yeah. PHILLIPS: And the boys didn't want that to happen either. Were many people in your village inducted into the army? That was common? Everyone went, or just some people? MARY VOKATY: Yes. Some didn't. PHILLIPS: Some did not? MARY VOKATY: Yeah. Like some didn't have the nerve to do what my father did, to move. JOSEPH VOKATY: No. He means if they did not leave the country they all had to serve, they had to . . . MARY VOKATY: Oh, yes. JOSEPH VOKATY: There was compulsory military training for all the young men. PHILLIPS: And so, and your father didn't want his boys to go off and fight. MARY VOKATY: Uh-huh. PHILLIPS: Well, there was no war going on. MARY VOKATY: Well, I'll tell you. My oldest brother would've, wouldn't have had to go because my father was an invalid, see. But ( whispering of others, off microphone ) I don't know how to tell. PHILLIPS: Just feel, you can say it any way you want to say it. Don't feel it has to be too formal, but I'm trying to get some understanding, trying to understand what it was like for you back in Czechoslovakia and for your family, because at some point they decided to leave, and I'm trying to understand why they did. I think part of the reason was because they didn't want their sons to be inducted, and so their sons in fact left, and the sons came first, I gather. MILDRED VOKATY: No, no, the sun . . . MARY VOKATY: They had to escape. MILDRED VOKATY: And they went to Germany. JOSEPH VOKATY: They'd left prior to the family movement. The family had to dispose of their belongings. And so the sons went to Germany and they waited for the family. And then after the family got to Germany where the ship was, then they all went on the ship together. But prior to that, going, they had relatives here in the United States, and they had friends here in the United States, and that was another incentive for them to leave. PHILLIPS: Sure, sure. MILDRED VOKATY: There was no war, and they were against the Austrian/Hungarian country. They were dominated by them. MARY VOKATY: They didn't ask to leave the country. JOSEPH VOKATY: They had no love for the German/Austrian government. MARY VOKATY: No men had to, could leave the country. PHILLIPS: They weren't supposed to leave. So how did they leave? MARY VOKATY: How? PHILLIPS: How did they leave? JOSEPH VOKATY: They fled. PHILLIPS: They fled. MARY VOKATY: They fled, yeah, they. PHILLIPS: Can you remember when they fled, what that was like? MARY VOKATY: Oh, it was terrible. It was awful and to think, of course, I wasn't quite twelve. And to me, it wasn't much. And my brother was two years older than I. So the two of us, we took it, just, and we had fun out of it, in fact. So on the boat it was, it got kind of stormy, so we lived in the lower deck and all my father could afford, you know, the money that we had from the house and the whole family, so it took so money, so we could only go with the lower deck. And when it got so stormy and everybody had to go under and just, my brother and I, we had fun. We were chasing around. PHILLIPS: That's on the deck outside. MILDRED VOKATY: Upper deck. MARY VOKATY: But they thought we could have been swept, so they made us go in. Then I remember . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: You mentioned that the ship hit an iceberg coming over. MARY VOKATY: Oh, yes. It was. JOSEPH VOKATY: And the ship was, uh, dead in the sea for one whole day while in need of repairs. MARY VOKATY: But we didn't know it. JOSEPH VOKATY: Until after you got here. MARY VOKATY: That was kept quiet. We knew we were standing, but, just, at most of the time you didn't know if she was going or if she was standing, you know. When it's so big. PHILLIPS: The ship was so big and you were down below most of the time. Can you remember when your brothers left Czechoslovakia to go to Germany? Do you remember that time? MARY VOKATY: Oh, yeah. PHILLIPS: What happened? MARY VOKATY: Well . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Did they leave during the day, or in night? MARY VOKATY: Huh? MILDRED VOKATY: Did they leave during the day, or at night time, or how did they leave? MARY VOKATY: Oh, they, they left on, see, there was a man that takes, Asian, that takes care of all these. And he arranges all the places where they go and what they do. This man does all that. PHILLIPS: I see. And so, tell me what happened when you got to Ellis Island, when you arrived in the United States? MARY VOKATY: All, we, everybody hollered, you know, "There's the Statue of Liberty," and that was something very exciting and maybe grownups realized a little different way. But we, as I was young yet, I, it was beautiful. Everything was exciting. PHILLIPS: And there were many other people from Czechoslovakia and Germany and . . . MARY VOKATY: Oh, yes. There was a bunch of, see, we came under a family and the boys came under young single men. MILDRED VOKATY: You mean, her brothers. MARY VOKATY: My brothers. They came under singles. And they were across, on the upper deck across, and they went over, over the thing, and stayed with us then. On the sly. JOSEPH VOKATY: They separated the young men, the women and the families. MARY VOKATY: Yes. JOSEPH VOKATY: They were all segregated on board ship. MARY VOKATY: And then the way my brothers went over the rail, or whatever it was, and they stayed with us already then. PHILLIPS: And when you were on Ellis Island how were you treated? MARY VOKATY: You know, to tell you the fact, I don't know. I even don't know how we slept. I think, I remember, I, with a little pillow, and we slept on the floor. I think. JOSEPH VOKATY: You came with your featherbeds from Europe, didn't you? MARY VOKATY: Yes. PHILLIPS: The down feathers from your geese. MARY VOKATY: Yes, there was, main thing was my mother was bringing it for my aunt. She wanted it. So she was bringing it for my aunt. So, uh, I remember I took that one pillow and I put it on the floor and I slept on the floor. That I remember. Or how we ate. That I can't remember either. JOSEPH VOKATY: Your mother baked some breads. MARY VOKATY: Oh, my mother, when we were coming, somebody advised her to bake a rye bread. So my mother made seven loaves of big bread, and we were eating that bread. PHILLIPS: So you had, you had plenty of your own food with you. You didn't have to rely on the Ellis Island kitchen. MARY VOKATY: Because there were some things that people couldn't eat, you know. If they saw the food, they couldn't eat. But when we had this bread, so, it was pretty good. But, so, we ate those seven loaves of bread by the time we came. PHILLIPS: What did your parents do when they first arrived, now, in America? They left Ellis Island. What did they do? They went to find their relatives, I suppose. MARY VOKATY: Well, we stayed with my uncle for, I think, I don't know, six or eight days. I think about eight days. JOSEPH VOKATY: That was here in Chicago. MARY VOKATY: That was in Chicago on, near Kedzie and 22nd, up there that way. And . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: There was a settlement where a lot of Czechs moved in there. MARY VOKATY: At that time. JOSEPH VOKATY: It was a very ethnic neighborhood. MARY VOKATY: People got in their neighborhood and they never knew how to speak English, because it was their neighborhood and they spoke Czech. Some of them. And, of course, I was, how was it that I, I learned very fast. I had a wonderful schoolteacher, a wonderful schoolteacher. JOSEPH VOKATY: You had to go back to first grade, didn't you, Mother? MARY VOKATY: This woman took me and she gave all the children in the room something to do, and she took me and she, by the window, and she said, "Mary, this is window, this is table." And she gave me so much time that I learned real fast. PHILLIPS: And so soon you were able to speak English? MARY VOKATY: Huh? PHILLIPS: Soon you were able to speak English? MARY VOKATY: Well, of course, it was broken English. And then I had a girlfriend and she, they liked to dance, and on a Friday they had dancing. So, for that reason they went to night school so they could dance that Friday, you know, have fun. And . . . MILDRED VOKATY: She helped you. She corrected you, didn't she? MARY VOKATY: Oh, yes. She would correct me. And girls, too, would correct me. They'd ask me if I don't would be hurt if they'd correct me. So whenever I said anything wrong or, so they told me how to do it. And that's why I learned very fast. PHILLIPS: So what happened after you, you went through school. MARY VOKATY: Oh, that was the hardest thing to do. I was twelve years, tall as I am now almost, and first grade, between the little tots. And oh, that was awful. JOSEPH VOKATY: They sent you back to first grade. MARY VOKATY: They, in the first grade. And, of course, they couldn't put me up any. So . . . MILDRED VOKATY: How long were you in first grade? How long were you in school? MARY VOKATY: Oh, uh, within three years, I made fifth grade, but I went to night school at the same time, so I wasn't only getting it this way, I was getting it from the night school. I was very anxious, I don't know why, but I was so anxious just to talk. PHILLIPS: And did your parents learn English quickly too, or did . . . MARY VOKATY: Oh, my mother never learned. And my father only a little bit, and my father used to do all kinds of, see, he was an invalid, so he used to do all kinds of odd, little odd jobs he, and he worked in, in park, outside in the park for a while and all kinds, anything. MILDRED VOKATY: You said in a stable for a while. He worked in a stable for a while, helping with the horses. MARY VOKATY: Oh, my father was very ambitious and very good and he was my advisor. My mother couldn't understand me, but she was more with my sister, but my father knew my ideas and he thought, he said that, of course, one time he told me I was his favorite child, but he did wonders for me. PHILLIPS: Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like for you when you left school and started work? Did you start work? Let me ask you that question. ( whispering can be heard in background ) MARY VOKATY: Oh, I quit school and I went to work and at that, just in that time it came a law, you have to be fourteen years before you can go to work. And I wasn't fourteen, so I had to go back to school until I was fourteen years. That was the worst thing in my life. PHILLIPS: Why was it so bad? MARY VOKATY: Because, a bunch of little kids, and somehow between them I didn't belong there. JOSEPH VOKATY: Did they make fun of you? MARY VOKATY: Oh, of course. They made fun of all the foreigners. When they came here they called us greenhorns. And, but somehow, maybe the grownups, I don't now how they took it, but I didn't. MILDRED VOKATY: You didn't care? Your first job was as, in a tailor shop, wasn't it? MARY VOKATY: Oh. My first job was tailor shop, men's tailoring. And then that's when it came that you had to be fourteen, so I had to go back until I was fourteen, and then I went to ladies tailoring and mens tailoring. JOSEPH VOKATY: What did you do there, Mother? MARY VOKATY: Huh? JOSEPH VOKATY: What did you do there? MARY VOKATY: First I pull stitches, ( she laughs ) and then I did little small things, and then keep on adding until you're more apt to do things. PHILLIPS: And how did you, how did your parents, during all of this, how were they settling in to the country? MARY VOKATY: Well, my mother was home all the time. She didn't know a word of English. And my father was very active. He was very active. MILDRED VOKATY: Ooh, Tell him about the cockroaches in your apartment? MARY VOKATY: Huh? MILDRED VOKATY: The cockroaches. MARY VOKATY: Oh. You know, when we moved in the neighborhood, so, it was, we were on the second or third floor, I don't know which. And the floor were separated. You know, they were made out of raw wood. And then there were cracks in between and my father didn't like it because each time you sweep you either sweep the dirt out. So my father took sticks, he made little sticks and he put it between those cracks and nailed them down. And the landlord thought he was a shoemaker. And when my father got it all fixed up, so he called him, he said, "Come and see what I did." So he showed him how he fixed the cracks. JOSEPH VOKATY: What about the cockroaches? MILDRED VOKATY: Yeah, you had tin walls, you know, the tin along the walls, and there were seams there, and there were cockroaches there. MARY VOKATY: Oh, you know, there was wood, like wooden, in between. And, of course, the way they were in pieces, so there were cracks and, not cockroaches. MILDRED VOKATY: That's what you . . . JOSEPH VOKATY: Bedbugs. MARY VOKATY: Bedbugs. Bedbugs were the bad ones. And my mother took from shoe polish can and she put kerosene in it and put it under the leg . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Of the bed. MARY VOKATY: And one would crawl in and they'd drown in the thing. So that's how they got rid of bedbugs. PHILLIPS: So, did it work? MARY VOKATY: Oh, it did. It did. PHILLIPS: Okay. So what happened after you, in fact, you worked in the tailoring shop, in the tailor's shop, what happened then? MARY VOKATY: Oh, there wasn't . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Well, you joined a gymnastics, a Sokol gym. MARY VOKATY: Oh, yeah. Then when I joined a gymnastic . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Organization. MARY VOKATY: But I was young yet, so I was just like work, acting. But when you get to be seventeen years, then you can be a member. So when I was seventeen years I got to be a member. JOSEPH VOKATY: Okay. That was called the Sokol's, right? MARY VOKATY: Huh? MILDRED VOKATY: They wanted you to be a doctor, uh, a teacher, didn't they? MARY VOKATY: Oh, yeah. They wanted me to be a gym teacher but, ( she blows her nose ) but I don't think why I didn't take it, because that would have been . . . END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO MARY VOKATY: . . . donate my time to the gym which I didn't, I donate my time to the whole family, you know. PHILLIPS: Did you, did your parents miss Czechoslovakia? Did their home? MARY VOKATY: Well, my mother did. But not, after a while she liked it here. After a while she got to like it. And she knew it was better here than up there, so she was quite satisfied. But my father, of course, he never liked it there. PHILLIPS: He liked life in America. MARY VOKATY: My father was very active. You know, he used to say, oh, he could say a few words English and he'd show my brothers how to be a good citizen. He said, "If only if I could talk." PHILLIPS: Well, is there anything else you think that would be interesting for us to know about that you would like to share with us? ( break in tape ) MARY VOKATY: . . . cracked, so they wired it up. So that one piece of wire, the cow swallowed and she couldn't eat, so they had to kill her. PHILLIPS: Kill the cow. MARY VOKATY: And they found out, they didn't know why, so, by killing her they found that little piece of wire in her stomach, which was a big loss. PHILLIPS: Yes, I bet it was. Because a cow was very valuable. JOSEPH VOKATY: The plot of land where you, you had to walk from the town to where you had your land that you had a garden, your vegetables in your field? That's right? ( Mary sighs loudly with emotion ) Did you, where did you get your wood, and did you go into the woods to get wood? MARY VOKATY: Oh, wood is easy to get there, anyplace. JOSEPH VOKATY: And you used to go and cut grass and bring it back home to feed the geese, is that right? MARY VOKATY: Uh-huh. JOSEPH VOKATY: The geese and the poultry were kept at home. However, you had to go out to the fields to get all of this, to the edge of town. MARY VOKATY: Mother had a bunch of little ones, so she took that grass and cut it up into tiny piece and feed it to them. PHILLIPS: Okay, I think that's about . . . MILDRED VOKATY: Is that it? PHILLIPS: I think so. I think it's as much as we can do. That just about wraps up this interview with Mary Vokaty, number 391 [DP-007], about three o'clock, and we'll call it the end of that tape, that interview.
