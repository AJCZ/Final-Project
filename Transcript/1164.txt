At that time my father was a little bit all right, you know, when I was young. And in the morning he tell me do this, do the other. Nobody want to work. My sister was next to me, you know what I mean. And one time my sister, instead of sleeping, say,"We got to do this." I told her, "Pappa vene a mi mazzatte." (Papa comes and we'll get hit) And my sister don't want to get up in the morning. I take match, I take the blinds off and I put match underneath her feet. My sister jumps from the bed. When my father come back, she told my father in the night. When he come back, my father, pretty near kill me. He give me so much, so much the police got to come along to bring me to the doctor. He hit me so much. The police come along and bring me to the doctor. I was all right in ten days. If I no was, no was all right in ten days, lock them up my father. SCISSURA: Oh, my God.

And he told all the class when you see me on the street, on the night, anytime you see in the street, tell, "Good morning, Boss. Good morning." (Carlo laughs) Good morning. Good morning. And I see the teacher one time, I never say, "Good morning, " you know what I mean. SCISSURA: So you were a little devil, then. MORELLI: I , no I forget, the next day when I go on the school, he call me. "Come her. You see me last night?" "Yeah, teacher." I want to find an excuse. "Come here." He put me on top of this boy. All over the, all over the school, you know. He had me on the ass. So much hurry up I pee on this boy because this boy he do before, then me. When I go home I tell my father, father the teacher pow!
