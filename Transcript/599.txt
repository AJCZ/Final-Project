SEAGRESS: Good afternoon this is Paul Seagress for the National Parks Service. Today is Thursday December 8th, 1994. I’m in Manhattan with George Goda. Mr. Goda came from Hungary in 1948; he was twenty-five years old at that time and ended up detained at Ellis Island. Mr. Goda can we begin by you giving me your birthdate please?

GODA: Yes Paul, I was born on April 6th, 1923. 

SEAGRESS: And where in Hungary were you born? 

GODA: In Budapest in a small hospital in Budapest. 

SEAGRESS: And when you were born was your name George Goda?

GODA: No my original name was Goldsdein. 

SEAGRESS: Can you spell that please? 

GODA: G-O-L-D-S-D-E-I-N…yeah something like that.

SEAGRESS: Goldsdein. And first name was George? 

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: Okay. Are there any circumstances or stories around your birth that were relayed to you later on? Stories your mother may have told about when she was carrying you or her actual delivery of you? 

GODA: No, not that I know anything special. I was…my mother was quite young and she got married, and I was the only grandson in the family at that time. 

SEAGRESS: Were your parents from Hungary? 

GODA: Yes they were both from Hungary.

SEAGRESS: What was your father’s name?

GODA: Erno. E-R-N-O.

SEAGRESS: And what can you tell me about his family background? 

GODA: He came from a grape-growing part of the country in Hungary called Gyongyos. 

SEAGRESS: Can you spell that please? 

GODA: G-Y-O-N-G-Y-O-S but with accent on the O, two accents on both O’s, and I really know very little about his family but he had a fairly extensive family—they all lived outside of Budapest—and he became a quite successful businessman, banker when he was young…before he even married my mother and lived in other towns outside of Budapest. 

SEAGRESS: Were there any stories that he ever relayed to you about his childhood? 

GODA: No. 

SEAGRESS: No. Tell me what his personality was like? 

GODA: He was a very tough, strong businessman, very successful in Hungary, had lots of friends, and when he came to the United States and I’ll get back to this later, he really lost himself because he couldn’t learn English and he wanted to go back but of course the Communist regime prevented it. So I really…I really don’t know much about him except that he was a very good businessman and a very industrious person. 

SEAGRESS: Do you have your own memories of your father when you were growing up—maybe something that you shared with your father as a child? 

GODA: Very little, frankly very little because he was very busy and you know making a living especially during the bad times. I would say the…just about when I was born and afterwards that was the depression in Hungary, a little later than here, and he had a hard time making a living. So we worked very hard including my mother, who also worked. 

SEAGRESS: What was your mother’s name? 

GODA: My mother’s name—maiden name was Olga Laub. L-A-U-B.

SEAGRESS: L-A-U-B. 

GODA: Right. 

SEAGRESS: And let me ask you the same sorts of questions about her. What do you know about your mother’s background? 

GODA: I know a lot more. First of all my mother had a father who had many brothers and they all were quite situated people, including a relative not immediate relative, but not too close of relative, if you heard of Laszlo Philip…is a very famous painter of the British crown mainly. He was also Laszlo as well. Also my grandfather was a…must have been a very talented person. I loved him but he died in 1933 so I was quite young, about ten years old. But he was a wonderful person and somebody who always wanted the first in techniques; he was a technical man and he had the first radio, he had the best radio, whatever was available, everything which was technical he had. 

SEAGRESS: He was very progressive. 

GODA: Very progressive. He was hunting and his family I don’t know exactly but from what I heard that his father came from Erdely if you know what it is—that’s now part of Romania that used to be Hungary. That’s Transylvania. 

SEAGRESS: What was the name?

GODA: Transylvania.

SEAGRESS: Yes but what was…?

GODA: Erdely.

SEAGRESS: Erdely. 

GODA: Erdely in Hungary. 

SEAGRESS: E-R-D-E…?

GODA: E-R-D-E-L-Y. He came…his father came from there and supposedly married a very wealthy noble person’s daughter. Actually not married but eloped with her, and I don’t know what happened later on but anyway that’s the story from the family. Anyway, so this grandfather of mine was a very good entrepreneur. He established a motor manufacturing company after he was working for one in Hungary…working for one of the largest ones, as I matter of fact I have one of his workbooks. So he made this company; it wasn’t very successful but it was very difficult for him but he was still manufacturing. 

SEAGRESS: And what were the manufacturing again? 

GODA: Electric motors. 

SEAGRESS: Electric motors. 

GODA: I can show you a sample here [laughs]. I got one. 

SEAGRESS: Well what are your own childhood recollections of your grandfather? You said you were very close to him. 

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: What…are their stories about you and your grandfather that come up in your mind? 

GODA: Well only that he was smoking a cigar constantly and I was hiding the cigar because the doctor said that it’s not good for him, you know things like this and I loved him. He was my absolutely favorite and vice versa.

SEAGRESS: Was your mother close to your father? 

GODA: I’m sure. Yes, yes absolutely. Absolutely. Now there were two sons and two daughters. The two…one of the daughters was my mother and the other one was much younger, only ten years older than I—that was the youngest one and two man and both became…and they joined at the manufacturing…mechanical…electrical engineers. But that happened later of course. They went to Czechoslovakia for the university.

SEAGRESS: Getting back to your mother. 

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: What was her personality like? 

GODA: Well she was very small—a little over or under five foot. Everybody loved her that’s all that I can think of; everybody loved her; she had a very fantastic personality. 

SEAGRESS: What were some of the things that your mother liked to do for herself? What were some of her hobbies or something along those lines?

GODA: She worked with my father. My father had a…later on had a textile printing company and she was learning the part of the production and the design. [Phone rings at 0:09:58] Oh I’m sorry. 

SEAGRESS: We’re going to pause just for a moment…Okay we’ve just paused with George Goda and then we’re now going to continue. 

GODA: Yes

SEAGRESS: We were talking about your mother 

GODA: My mother. 

SEAGRES: ….and working with your father. 

GODA: Yes she worked in the plant and she was mainly doing the design with some other help and some of the manufacturing. They had been printing scarves and tablecloth and material for furniture, and of course that’s changed all the time. But they were making all right. 

SEAGRESS: Now did you have brothers and sisters? 

GODA: I had no brothers and sisters. I’m the only. 

SEAGRESS: You were an only child. Can you describe for me the house or apartment that you grew up in?

GODA: Okay. The very beginning, which I don’t remember, we were living in an apartment somewhere near the parliament and…

SEAGRESS: And this is in Budapest? 

GODA: In Budapest, yeah. I don’t remember the apartment, however, I remember that we moved into the house where the factory was. There was a factory which was in the back of the building and in the front of the apartment, and my grandparents…my grandmothers [Unintelligible: 0:11:35] they took an apartment and my parents took an apartment and that was a…I don’t know three or four room apartment, nothing special, right next to my grandparents. 

SEAGRESS: And can you describe for me how the house was lit? How the apartment was lit? 

GODA: That I really don’t remember but it must have been lights in the center. 

SEAGRESS: Electric? 

GODA: Oh of course, of course. It was fairly modern. I have pictures of it. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me what it was your like. You said your grandfather was across the hall and you didn’t talk at all about your grandmother? 

GODA: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me a little about your grandmother. 

GODA: Okay. 

SEAGRESS: Your mother’s mother. 

GODA: My grandmother was a very active woman, excellent housewife, and she had family dinners on many, many occasions—every occasion there was. But I remember that I was a very poor eater and I don’t want to eat her fantastic cooking and desserts so I would yes and I went out of the kitchen and made myself a couple of scrambled eggs because that’s all I liked. We were very large family by then. 

SEAGRESS: Large meaning…

GODA: Large meaning…

SEAGRESS: Extended family or…? 

GODA: Well they all lived in the same building—the whole family—and we were actually by the time the war came, there were thirteen people in the family—in the immediate family. I know there were thirteen because we all survived the Holocaust, which is very unusual. 

SEAGRESS: Mm-hmm. Can you just…you said…can you just list the thirteen people so I get an idea of exactly…

GODA: Yeah sure. So my mother and father…my grandfather died in ’33 so I cannot really consider him because of course much earlier…my grandmother, two of my uncles, one of my aunts, and then in 1944 there were a couple more [grandchilds]—I mean my cousins—I don’t know how many you counted so far but…

SEAGRESS: Just trying to get an idea of what’s actually…

GODA: Yeah that’s how much. That’s how much. 

SEAGRESS: Can you give me a description of what it was like to be in you know tight quarters with so many people? 

GODA: Well we haven’t seen each other too much except maybe my grandmother because they were on different floors. 

SEAGRESS: I see so they were in the same building. 

GODA: Same building and different floors. So it was not really what I would consider close quarters you know. 

SEAGRESS: I just want to say for the sake of the tape that it may be picking up kitchen noises. 

GODA: Mm-hmm oh. 

SEAGRESS: Is it picking up? Yeah okay. 

GODA: We have to close the door then. 

SEAGRESS: Okay we’re now returning again. Can you give me just some sort of idea of your childhood years? Obviously your life changed dramatically with the coming of World War II.

GODA: Mm-hmm. 

SEAGRESS: Can you give me an idea of what life was like prior to the war?

GODA: Okay. Well I was a very poor student. Unfortunately they put me into the elementary school a year earlier than I was supposed to. That…as a result I was always behind and firstly they put me into a private, very, very, private, very expensive, very exclusive, private elementary school which I attended for three years and they picked us up by taxi everyday. You know it was probably okay but I don’t know if it was a smart idea for my sake because I got spoiled and I remember that I loved every kind of sports all the time. The routine was that after lunch you went to play soccer or whatever you know, and I was a poor eater and I had to stay at the table until I finished the food and I didn’t eat it, and they came back from the playing and I was still sitting at the table not eating. Anyway, for the last year of my elementary…it was the fourth year…I went to public school. They put me into public school otherwise I was only interested in sports, nothing else. I didn’t study. I didn’t learn anything. I hated it. I had constantly tutors including German and whatever you want constantly I had tutors and people who were teaching me and I was resisting and it was just awful. 

SEAGRESS: Were your parents educated people?

GODA: Well my father was not really; my mother was.

SEAGRESS: How important was it to them that you get a well-rounded education? 

GODA: Oh absolutely. Absolutely, I think it was very important. 

SEAGRESS: So this must have been frustrating for... 

GODA: It was very frustrating for them and for me, and they didn’t know what to do with me because I was not learning and I was not willing to do any studying.

SEAGRESS: That’s interesting. One thing I want to pick up on—you mentioned of course that you were a poor eater and that you wouldn’t eat a lot. I’m curious, what wouldn’t you eat? What things specifically did you not like? 

GODA: Good food. Good food, which my grandmother cooked—excellent food.  I just wasn’t interested and my mother…I’ll tell you an interesting story that my mother constantly said: ‘Gyuri’—that was my name in Hungary, my name, Gyuri.  

SEAGRESS: That’s J-U-R-I?

GODA: G-Y-U-R-I.

SEAGRESS: G-Y-U-R-I.

GODA: …R-I…She said ‘Gyuri eat. Gyuri eat. Gyuri eat’ and that went on all the time. And when I got married later on here in the States and I settled down somehow, that all of a sudden one day my mother said ‘Gyuri don’t eat. Gyuri don’t eat.’ [laughs] I start from the beginning there. Anyway that’s really a side story. But then I went to a rear school, which means after the first four years. Rear school, which means I was single being an engineer so I don’t want to study Latin because every other schools had Latin education and I wanted to get away from it. So I went to a rear school

SEAGRESS: Can you say that word again?

GODA: Rear. R-E-A-R Rear. Rear.

SEAGRESS: Oh I see. 

GODA: Rear. So I went there and I was a very poor student—very poor student—so much so that after the third year the mathematics professor said ‘I better leave. I better go to another school.’ So I went to another school and then he followed me to the other school [laughs]. Anyway, I’m going a little step ahead…in nineteen thirty…probably ’37 or so I had pleurisy and I was sick for quite a while; they didn’t know how to treat it at that time, and they were very much afraid…you know they were very conservative…very conservative doctor.

SEAGRESS: And what were the symptoms of pleurisy and what…how were you affected by this?

GODA: I really don’t remember. I think I had a little fever and there was some liquid in my lung, or not in the lung, between the lung and the [Unintelligible: 0:21:41] and I have to tell you this because it will come back for the immigration. And I was a Boy Scout from when I was thirteen, I became a Boy Scout and I loved to hike and go to Boy Scout camps and I was doing very well. It was wonderful for me. I went skiing and whatever…even today I am in contact with all the people who were at the Boy Scout. We have a [publication] for twice or three times a year, and that’s very unusual, really. We are keeping tab of over a hundred people from the same group.  

SEAGRESS: Well and it would make sense that you liked the Boy Scouts because it was very athletic.

GODA: Oh yes. It was very athletic. It was a wonderful thing to be and I went down for the first time with other people and somebody was playing very well and I was playing very well so we immediately hit it off and so it was a wonderful thing for me. And then in nineteen…when I was thirty years old…which was…1923…33…36…36 I became a full Boy Scout.  As a matter fact then I was playing a very good chess for example, and I played all I can do. I was at the World Champion at that time. Of course I was beaten [laughs] but that’s beside the point.

SEAGRESS: Now was this… 

GODA: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: You started telling us this because you were bringing up the pleurisy. Is this how old you were when it first made its appearance? 

GODA: Yes. What happened is I went…one of the Boy Scouts on the camps on the Danube and I had a cold and I went in a canoe, and the boys were in the water and they turned me over. And me having a cold and the water was cold, it was I think [Unintelligible: 0:24:09] or so; it wasn’t very warm so I got another cold, which became pleurisy. Then later on that’s why I got to Ellis Island. 

SEAGRESS: Ended up at Ellis Island. Tell me about your family’s religious background and what kind of religious life they maintained and so on? 

GODA: Well I was born Jewish but none of my family had any religious inclination whatsoever except my grandmother who was lighting a candle every Friday—that was the only religious thing I have encountered. Now I went to religious education but I went so far in despising it that I didn’t even buy a book. I didn’t go to the classes; I didn’t go to wherever I had to go to the wherever. I completely despised it. Why? I don’t know. But I don’t know anything about it and none of my family did, except for my grandmother. 

SEAGRESS: With the Jewish religion being so unimportant…

GODA: Yes.

SEAGRESS: …to your parents. Did they maintain the name Goldsdein …

GODA: No, no. Actually what happened is that I was probably in the first grade in the gymnasium or second grade, my uncle who was at that time here in the United States for many years by then and he took the name of Goda. And he converted my parents and me to Goda.

SEAGRESS: So that was done in Hungary then? You were both…

GODA: [Interrupts] Oh yes that must have been done in probably ’38 or even earlier ’36 probably. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me about your own recollections of the first inklings of war and what was going on in Budapest in the thirties—politically and socially? 

GODA: Well you know there were many laws, which came out against the Jews. Many people lost their jobs forcefully, which I only heard and I learned now what happened basically because I wasn’t aware of that much because it did not affect my family at all. Because we had our own business…

SEAGRESS: [Interrupts] The plant kept going.

GODA: The plant kept going and in time my youngest aunt married a famous engineer who took over the organization of the company and reorganized it top to bottom, and became a very efficiently run organization and grew tremendously just before the war. So we had probably a hundred people working at that time and he was the primary mover because he was such a good organizer. So actually three uncles of mine were running it. 

SEAGRESS: Did the extended the family—the uncles and aunts—did they also have this sort of remove from the Jewish religion too?

GODA: Oh yes, yes. 

SEAGRESS: So basically the whole family?

GODA: Yes, yes. 

SEAGRESS: When did you become conscious that something important was going to happen? 

GODA: Well when I was you know Boy Scouts meeting, you know we were a small group let’s say six or eight people—there was one guy who was Communist even so that time it was not sort of expected and he and we had a lot of arguments, a lot of discussions about it. I think that was the only time that I was…the first time I was exposed to this and I get the feeling of what it means when I heard Hitler speak, and I also went a couple of times to Austria to vacation. And one time when I went to [Karnten], I was staying with a family who were absolutely Nazis. Everywhere they had crowds was out and they were openly Nazis and that was just before the Auschwitz if you know…and of course I was aware. They didn’t know that I’m Jewish or not. I didn’t know whether they knew it or not. But I really hadn’t been affected by it until the very end luckily. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me a little bit about what Hungary went through during the war and what your…the experience of your family at that time…

GODA: Mm-hmm.

SEAGRESS: …in the early forties. How the war affected the operation?

GODA: Well first of all my uncle, one of my uncles, was called into not military but work-labor and they took him to somewhere in Russia and also I was going for not military but I don’t know….work-labor, work-labor and that was in nineteen forty…1943 and my family had very good connections and somehow they managed to get my uncle and me out from the work-camp, imagine. I came as a special guard back to Budapest. Actually I have a lot more to tell before this happened…

SEAGRESS: Oh well please do. 

GODA: Okay. 

SEAGRESS: I’m just trying to sort of guide us along. 

GODA: Yeah, yeah, yeah I know. I jumped a little too far. Anyway, as I said I was not affected at all by all of this. We had a very good social life and we have a house up in the very fashionable area in Budapest and a summer arrangement and we had million guests and really quite a normal life until probably 1943 summer or so and actually the first [phone interrupts at 0:32:22].

SEAGRESS: We’re going to pause again…okay we are now resuming again and you were saying life was pretty good actually. 

GODA: Pretty good we had parties and whatever you want. As a matter of fact in 1944 April…April 19 when the Germans occupied Hungary, we went for a hiking in underground. How do you call that? 

SEAGRESS: Caves?

GODA: Caves. Caves—the lamps and a group of people and we spent all day of a Sunday there and we came out, it was very nice. We came out and I rushed home and changed because I was invited to a concert—to a private concert for a friend of ours—and I wasn’t noticing what happened. I just went there and I ring the bell and she came out: ‘oh I thought that was the Germans.’ So then I learned what happened. Anyway, April 19th was the really day…dividing line when we had to be living a little differently—not much but still a little differently because the Germans were in and as a matter of fact we had several…sort of a hotel and [Unintelligible: 34:00] occupied it so his S.S. group took over. So we couldn’t go there anymore. Anyway, then I received my invitation to join the work group, and that was out in the upper part of Hungary, northern part of Hungary and I went in and we spent six weeks there. and I enjoyed it because it was a very nice country and the military commander was very nice and the only thing we had to do is every week, once we had to go to the main center, and then we had to decide which group you want to join. So you want to join the textile workers or do you want to join the island workers or whatever you know, and that went on for six weeks and we were…I really enjoyed it because I was a Boy Scout and I took it as a…not as a punishment but as …it depends on how you take it psychologically. 

SEAGRESS: So these camps were they…were they supervised by the Germans? 

GODA: No, no Germans. 

SEAGRESS: By the Hungarians. 

GODA: No Germans. 

SEAGRESS: Hungarians.

GODA: Hungarians and that happened to be probably a very decent guy who was running it. In fact one day there was again a distribution and my idea was—and I had a very, very good sense to survive—that that I join the smallest group, not the largest group, the smallest group, and that was the engineers. I wasn’t an engineer but I joined the engineers and maybe there were twenty people…twenty people joined in this and the other one were hundreds and hundreds of people. And they put us into a train, locked up, and we went to another town, the whole everybody except one group stayed there. It was… the name of the town was Yolsva Y-O-L-S-V-A, and we went to another town which was called Yasberen where there was a very famous group of Hungarian books and they put us up in a huge…all the groups and they said that this group goes there and this group goes there and you know they went to wherever he sent them. And only this little group where I was stayed. And he started individually, “what is your education?” and that went on and I said something, not good enough, and never asking two or three people who said not good enough. So he said ‘you go back to Yolsva where you came from.’ Obviously there were a few more people than he was expecting. We were happy. So we went back to Yolsva where we joined and a special group who was really being of the guard. They were absolutely taken with the guard and trying to stay there. So that was considered a special group of workers. Anyway from there we went to another town called Michicots, its a larger town in Hungary where we actually didn’t do anything but later on [Recording skips at 0:38:24] woodworking plant where they cut up the wood—they put it into…they load it into trains—and I worked there. I don’t know for how many weeks but I worked there and I enjoyed. I considered it as a…as fun. 

SEAGRESS: Where were you housed in these camps? What kind of accommodations? 

GODA: I know we were in the attic and were sleeping on hay or something like this. No problem. I don’t remember any problem. The food was okay. As a matter of fact even they sent me some food from Budapest, yeah. And that was the place where they took me off and brought me back to Budapest. Now interestingly I you know I had some friends there. I think four or five, I send them all pictures here, and we decided at that time if the Russians came, we are going to go in their direction. None of them came back. The ones who went back with the Germans or with the Hungarians or whatever more or less survived. But they wanted to…tried to go over to the Russian side. None of them. I would have gone. Anyway they took me out and back to Budapest. They put me into a…no the company by that time my smaller manufacturing company became important for the Germans. So it became important for the war effort. So we had a guy who was sitting there all day long. As a matter of fact he was sitting in our bedroom and I sneaked into the bedroom during the night. I took out from his desk this military certificates that you are working for—whatever—and I put in…there by that time, I think there were about eighty Jewish people. We took everybody whoever we could. I mean my uncle, and I think there were close to eighty people who were there because they wanted to save them because that was a certain amount of protection. So I gave everybody a false certificate with a stamp, which I stole from this guy’s desk and …we save the picture. They gave me a picture but I told them that use only in [Unintelligible: 0:42:05] and unfortunately there was a very good friend of mine and unfortunately he went to a movie and they got him, and he was not…he didn’t survive. They shot him. Anyway we saved a lot of people. So I perfectly stayed at home. For a while I was moving every morning from…there was a synagogue somewhere, which temporarily gave us shelter and then…but then I moved in back into our house and their were also a lot of girls…a lot of my girlfriends who joined the company. Yes, very important people including my father. Anyway then [Unintelligible: 0:43:10] and the Nazis…the Hungarian Nazis took over if you know this date. That changed everything. First of all, which is an interesting fact that came out later after the war you know there was a declaration by Horty, who was the head of the government at that time.

SEAGRESS: Horty?

GODA: Nicholas Horty. He was the head…

SEAGRESS: Horty? How do you spell that please? 

GODA: H-O-R-T-Y. He was the president or whatever you want to call it and he needed a declaration that he doesn’t want to serve the Germans anymore and blah, blah, blah, but he had no military powers to back it up. So the Germans and the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis, took it over and that night—October 15th—were very close to the headquarters of the Nazi party, the Hungarian Nazi party, one block away practically, a famous place. And we decided because of the declaration we thought that this guy was going to make a declaration without having some power behind him that if they come, they are going to resist. So we equip ourselves with metal pieces and [water] holes and whatever. Luckily they didn’t come. They didn’t come because there was a woman—a Nazi woman—who decided that she heard that there is a lot of Jews around here in one of these buildings but she didn’t know exactly which building. And she came around and she saw that it is a war factory. Is she coming? If she comes in, not one of us will stay alive. No one of us—they would have killed us, everybody. So luckily they didn’t and on the other hand they were frustrated and they started going into the buildings near and next to us and across the street and started shooting people. They went into apartments and unfortunately some friends were shot. So then after the war, there were some trials and that came out. Anyway that changed everything because very shortly afterwards they decided that [phone rings at 0:46:12].

SEAGRESS: Want to pause?...Okay we’re continuing now. Mr. Goda you were saying how things…

GODA: …changed.

SEAGRESS: …really changed at this point. 

GODA: Yes. Then very shortly afterwards, I don’t know the date exactly but probably within a month they decided to call in all the military personnel who were Jewish and got an earlier advanced notice from the state department in Hungary that said watch out, don’t go. So my family stayed away. I was hiding under the desk when they came to collect us and so somehow all the rest of my family did manage not to go except one of my uncles, and they wanted to put them on the train to go out. 

SEAGRESS: These are the Hungarian Nazis who were…?

GODA: Yes, yes. I mean that was all the German operation you know to put them on the train and go take them to Austria or Poland or Auschwitz or whatever. Anyway one of my uncles went I don’t know why and how, and then one put him off from the train. You know who I guess. But otherwise we stayed and we started hiding. We built a …we had a very tall room on the second floor which was extending into the attic and at one time that was cut down to normal size and there was a space about this high above the room and there was a …we need an entrance from the attic, where you can crawl in…there were a couple of bricks, and we put rocks in, we put…that was previously we did, and lights, food, so people could stay there. And I stayed there for a couple of days but my uncle and aunt…[recording skips at 0:48:46]. The Nazis broke in and they tried to get him and they couldn’t; he was so well hidden that they couldn’t find him. I stayed only a couple of days so that was after I left but that was a temporary shelter until we could find something else, so that started the process of surviving somehow and going from one place to another. My parents were quite successful getting various different possibilities. For example, my mother rented a room actually from a Nazi, and my father was his [legitimate] lover [recording skips 0:50:03] and his son, and at Christmas in 1944 we went there and we celebrated the Christmas there, and I stayed there and my father stayed there with my mother in a small, narrow room. That was the day when the Russians started bombarding Budapest and something hit the wall where our room was and it came in and it spread all over—there were three beds—and it pulled this shrapnel pieces and none of us got even a scratch. I said it was an absolute miracle. Anyway we had to move from there of course and then it was difficult but my parents always found something. 

SEAGRESS: How would you find food for instance at this period? 

GODA: Well I don’t remember. I know that we had a very well stocked kitchen and storage in the factory, which later on came into play but I don’t know where we got food from and there was no problem. Somehow there was no problem at least for us. I don’t know. I know for example, my wife was a young girl at that time—she had problems getting food. I have no idea.

SEAGRESS: So would you say that your life pretty much continued this way until the war ended? 

GODA: Well we were liberated by the Russians in January’45 and within a few days we went back to our house where we found tons of food, which that was very scarce. That was when the ghetto was liberated and my grandmother was calling everybody in and giving food too. And I had some friends who came and so then…no… life started to pick up again, normal. Even so on the other side of Budapest it was still the war going on. From then on basically that was it. From then on it was only a matter of food really because there was very scarce so we moved down to a smaller town in Hungary where there was plenty of food, and we rented something and we stayed there for I don’t know for a month or two. As a matter of fact I went down to [Unintelligible: 0:53:03] which was already a long time liberated and even the university started going and I went to the university and enrolled—that was before the war actually ended…the final ending and then before so…and then we came back to Budapest. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me about the political climate in Budapest after, directly after the war and what was going on. 

GODA: Yeah well in 1944…45. When I went down to [Unintelligible: 0:53:51] that’s where the university was already open, there was a meeting—a Communist meeting—outside and I said that the guys are coming to take over the government until our country is built up, and that you know remained in my mind, and exactly that’s what they did. 

SEAGRESS: And how did they go about doing that? 

GODA: In ’45 there was a coalition government, which was not communist at all and everybody had confidence in it. As a matter of fact so much so that my family put all their money into building a new factory, and I built a new factory in 1948. When it was finished, Communists took it over by that time. Anyway I have been keeping very close touch and contact with the whole situation because I went out with a girl whose father was a member of the parliament for many, many years. And I have a big influence and I remember the reason why I’m here that there was a dinner meeting with a lot of politicians plus an American newspaper and after dinner, we had of course a discussion. And the newspaperman said and that was in 1947, and I’ll never forget it and he said, ‘there will be Communism here. Just look at the orthodox Jews. They are leaving. They know.’ And I remember this and in 1948 December in Christmas, I’m sorry ’47 Christmas, by that time the Communists took over the important post like the police and the inter-military affairs and you know some of the…they know how to do this. And they came out with the ruling that the old passports, the green passports, which were standard for many, many years, were not going to be valid after January 11, 1945. I said ’48. 

SEAGRESS: ’48

GODA: ’48 and you know I said myself I don’t like it. Maybe I will go and get a new passport so I decided…by that time I have to tell you my parents were out here. 

SEAGRESS: Oh your parents had come to this country? 

GODA: Had come to this country in 1947 as visitors to my uncle. 

SEAGRESS: And your uncle was in New York? 

GODA: Not in New York. In Washington, D.C. 

SEAGRESS: In Washington. 

GODA: But he was here for by then thirty years, and he came in ’46 to Hungary visiting us and then my parents went in ’47 to visit him. So they were out here and I was there, and I was still going to the university by that time. I mean in Budapest. By the way I was studying there [laughs].

SEAGRESS: Going to school better. 

GODA: So I decided I don’t like this, you know, and I made every effort from Christmas to January 11 that I get my passport extended to Switzerland and Austria and I had to get permit through Russian permit, and all sort of permits, and things to be able travel.  

SEAGRESS: We’re going to pause right now so that Peter can put in another tape. 

GODA: Sure. 

SEAGRESS: Okay we’re now beginning tape two with George Goda who came from Hungary in 1948 when he was twenty-five. Today is Thursday December 8th, 1994. I’m Paul Seagress and Peter [Hahn] is running the recording equipment. Mr. Goda when we ended tape one you were saying about the Communist takeover was making you nervous and you knew that you didn’t want to be there anymore. 

GODA: Right. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me a little bit more about the sorts of things that made you uneasy about the Communists being in Hungary? Why were they such a threat to people? [Phone rings at 0:59:06]. We’re going to pause for just a second.

SEAGRESS: Okay here we go again. You were just going to tell us about some of the reasons why the Communist takeover was threatening to people. 

GODA: Well to me it was basically intuition. Secondly, I knew somehow I felt by reading some books, understanding what Communism was all about, what’s going to happen—the loss of freedom and loss of the individual. So I somehow felt it. I don’t know from where and how. Because you know I had no experience before or I had no exposure to it before but its mainly I think intuition. Like I had a fantastic intuition during the German area to avoid things and to…I have been directing practically my family what to do. I had…I know what to do without having a fear of anything ever. I never felt that I’m going to get killed or anything. I had no such thing in my mind. I knew that I’m going to survive and I know by intuition that I have to…what I have to do.  

SEAGRESS: What kinds of things did you see happening during this transitional period? 

GODA: Oh the Communist regime. Well I saw that slowly they took over the government. I don’t know if you heard of the Salami technique. It was called Salami technique that slice by slice they took over the main important part of the government and all the functions. Not at once but slice by slice and there was an election where they were cheating. They got twenty percent of the vote, and everyday they were cheating, there was a special absentee ballot and they went from one town to another and they were voting several times with the ballot. So somehow I felt that’s not for me and I don’t want to be…I was always afraid of being closed in to do what the others do. I want to be always on my own and that was my idea always through the German area. As I said before to join the smallest group and try to be an individual and not try to be a group. Not to go with a group. So I cannot tell you exactly why. 

SEAGRESS: How long had your parents been in America? When did they come over? You said at ’47 right? 

GODA: They came in ’47 really to visit but really they came with a little just a suitcase, nothing else. So they had to fly because of the weather or I don’t know why they had to fly from Hungary so they couldn’t take anything with them. And my father wanted to go back he didn’t know how to speak English, and when I told him that ‘father why don’t you learn a few words,’ he says ‘ahhh everybody knows Hungarian in New York’ you know so that was his attitude, and he wanted to come back; he was very successful there and of course… anyway they came in ’47. They wanted to come back…to go back and I had a full, corrugated box of correspondence from their friends because they didn’t know what to do—especially my father—he wanted to go back and my mother doesn’t want to go back, and they both…their tickets back…going back and it went on for months and for months and for months until their friends were…I don’t know how you say this in English…they had to move out from Hungary to a small, little town. That was one of the Communist decisions that the middle class cannot stay in Budapest, they have to move out. So until this point he wanted to go back and then slowly, slowly, he was convinced not to go back and by the time I came [phone rings at 0:64:27].

SEAGRESS: We’re going to pause for a second.

SEAGRESS: Okay we were just talking about the fact that your father suddenly began to realize that he should stay where he was. 

GODA: Very difficult. It was awful difficult because he didn’t speak the language and he had very little money and you know to start a new career at his age…it wasn’t easy. 

SEAGRESS: Well let’s get you to America. 

GODA:  Yeah, okay. 

SEAGRESS: You extended your visa and you got it extended to Switzerland and…

GODA: Not a visa—I extended my passport.

SEAGRESS: Your passport. 

GODA: And on January 11th it was the last train…last train with the old passport and I came out and I went skiing for six weeks or four weeks or I don’t know. I went skiing. I love skiing. 

SEAGRESS: Where did you go skiing? 

GODA: In Switzerland. 

SEAGRESS: So when you left from Budapest to go to Switzerland your intention was to not go back to Budapest? 

GODA: I had…no. 

SEAGRESS: No?

GODA: No I just had the intuition to get out. I had no decision. I had no visa. I had no nothing. I knew that I wanted to go skiing so I went skiing and I skied for I think six weeks, and then I decided to get after all a student visa for U.S.. But in order to get this I had to be enrolled in a university here, which my parents did somehow in Miami, but I had to take an exam for English, which I didn’t know. So I went to Basel where the examination was given and I wanted to study there but the Swiss being very unfriendly people, they kicked me out in a couple of days from Basel—near the border and blah, blah, blah—anyway they wanted to send me back to Hungary and I wasn’t willing to. Finally I got an idea to go to the French part of Switzerland where they are much more lenient than the Germans. So I went to Lausanne and I stayed there for almost three months and in the meantime that’s where the interesting story starts. My uncle had a close friend here in Washington who was obviously awfully an influential guy, and I just found his obituary and he was a friend of Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and he was very close to Herbert Hoover, who was actually in the F.B.I. and he managed to get me here—a regular visa not a student visa—based on that in 1979 my parents applied for a visa for me to come to the World’s Fair, which was possible, I don’t know if its true or not but it’s possible because they were making some tablecloth for the Hungarian restaurant here at the World’s Fair. So it’s a very good possibility. Anyway it took a lot of doing and I have some interesting concerns at that time because in order to get a visa at that time for a Hungarian, it took seven years waiting if you know…for a visa number plus you have to convince the consul, wherever you were—I happened to be in Switzerland—so in Zurich to give me the visa, and he managed both. He got me a number from the State Department. He wrote a letter, which I might have here, to the consul in Switzerland, to give me the visa and in no time I got the visa. 

SEAGRESS: How did that feel when that finally happened for you?

GODA: Well. I don’t know [laughs]. I don’t know. But very shortly afterwards I went…I had to fly actually from Switzerland to England because I couldn’t get a visa through France if I couldn’t go…they didn’t give me one, and then I took a boat to New York. 

SEAGRESS: What was the name of the ship? Do you remember? 

GODA: Yes. S.S. France. 

SEAGRESS: And what port did it leave from? 

GODA: It left from England I guess. 

SEAGRESS: And what were you bringing with you to America? What did you pack to take to America?

GODA: Well I had my skis [laughs] probably and a small suitcase, nothing else. I don’t think I had anything else. As a matter of fact if I recall correctly yes it got lost. It got lost somehow. 

SEAGRESS: Your luggage got list? 

GODA: Luggage, yeah. Luggage got lost. 

SEAGRESS: Uh huh. Were you traveling alone or were you with anybody else, friends or? 

GODA: No, completely alone. Completely alone and I remember I recall an interesting story that in Europe I couldn’t stand being in the same room as fish. I hated it and when I came on the boat everybody was sick. I wasn’t and I was siting at a big table all alone and the waiter came and he brought a beautiful fish and he said ‘why don’t you try? Why don’t you try?’ so I said ‘look new country. I tried it.’ I didn’t like it but I tried it. Anyway that’s when immigration starts. I arrived in New York and...  

SEAGRESS: How long did it take to get across the Atlantic? 

GODA: Probably a week. It was a fast boat; it was a big boat. 

SEAGRESS:  What else do you remember about the ship? Can you describe for me where you slept on the ship?
 
GODA: Well I traveled third class but I managed to find my way to the first class. So I spent really my time in the first class and I remember meeting nice people, a nice girl. And I was…I had a good time. 

SEAGRESS: Were there entertainments? 

GODA: Oh yeah I’m sure there were entertainments. I don’t remember specifically but on the first class you had everything even at that time.  

SEAGRESS: But you weren’t sleeping on the first class? 

GODA: No I was sleeping on the third class but I didn’t get sick because I woke a lot and I stayed up in the air at the top so I managed not to get sick. 

SEAGRESS: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? 

GODA: Oh yes.

SEAGRESS: Did you know what that was?

GODA: Yes, yes. Absolutely, absolutely. 

SEAGRESS: Well tell me what happened once you got into New York?

GODA: Once I got into New York there was a very jovial, nice immigration officer and I was very happy to see him, and he asked me for my paper. So when I got my visa I had to get some X-rays because of my previous health history at the consulate in Zurich. And I showed it to him here it is and ‘oh no that’s no good you have to go there.’ So they took me aside, and this is a very short story by the way. I remember that there was a big room and when I had to go to the men’s room, somebody came with me—locked, open, closed, whatever—and then they put me in the hospital. And in the hospital they started to take my temperature. And they gave me this little thermometer in my mouth. I didn’t know what to do with it because in Europe you use a thermometer under your arm and this I almost chewed it. And they were mad at me that I didn’t know how to use it. Anyway I arrived probably on a Friday. I don’t know exactly but I think it was a Friday and I probably spent a day or two at the hospital and Monday morning my uncle came with probably a little cash and in ten minutes I was liberated. 

SEAGRESS: Did you know what Ellis Island was? When the immigration officer said you’re going to Ellis Island, I mean did you know what that was? 

GODA: Probably not. Probably not. 

SEAGRESS: Is there anything else that sticks out…

GODA: But I was very happy seeing it and the Statue of Liberty.

SEAGRESS: Was there anything else about the Ellis Island experience that sticks out in your mind? Some other people who were there or…?

GODA: Unfortunately nothing. Honestly I stayed a very short period of time and I remember these problems with the nurse who couldn’t believe that I couldn’t take my temperature and otherwise you know I was lucky to get out because people were staying there for a long time. 

SEAGRESS: The uncle who came to get you was this the uncle who had been in America for thirty years? 

GODA: Yeah, yeah. 

SEAGRESS: So you really don’t know this man at all? You’d never met him before? 

GODA: Oh yes he was in Hungary. He was in Hungary in 1946. 

SEAGRESS: I see. 

GODA: He spent the summer with us. 

SEAGRESS: Where did he take you? 

GODA: When I came from Ellis Island? 

SEAGRESS: Yes. Where did your uncle take you? 

GODA: Well we ride on the subway but I don’t remember where I think in the Bronx but I’m not sure where we stayed. But then he went to New Jersey and he brought a brand new car when I arrived. It was a beautiful car and we stayed there for a while and then we moved to Washington D.C.

SEAGRESS: Is that where your parents were in Washington?

GODA: No, no. They were together. They were together. 

SEAGRESS: Do you have any recollections of how you felt when you saw your parents? Because you’re a…you know young adult at this point, so? 

GODA: Nothing. Nothing I remember of …I mean I haven’t…it wasn’t such along period of time that I had seen them and I had constant correspondence with them. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me for instance in your first month in America…

GODA: Yeah.

SEAGRESS: …things that struck you as being unusual or things that you really liked? What made an impression on you when you first got here? 

GODA: Well I had a not so happy [passion] that I traveled up to the Bronx on the elevator subway and that wasn’t pretty. That wasn’t pretty at all you know you see the top of the houses and the things outside…the outside and all these things so it wasn’t a nice view at all. I really don’t remember…oh yes I walked on Broadway and was very impressive. The Times Square was awfully impressive because the lights are on during the day, and finally I met some people from the boat in Times Square. Otherwise I don’t remember specifically what impressed me. 

SEAGRESS: Well of course you had been to major cities before. 

GODA: Yes. Yes.

SEAGRESS: So it may not have been all that new. Talk to me about learning English and that whole process. 

GODA: Okay. Well that comes to another stage of the whole thing. I went to Washington D.C. and I went to an Americanization school there and there was a lady, an older lady, who obviously was friends with Eleanor Roosevelt and she was very fond of her because every day she read an article because she was in Paris in that time when the NATO not NATO, the U.N. interrogation or something like this, UNESCO I don’t know, and there was an article in the Washington Post every single day about which she wrote and we had it. But I didn’t learn much there because you know you hear the other accents and its all just fun. 

SEAGRESS: Was it specifically for adults or were there children in it? 

GODA: I think it was for adults. I really don’t remember. But that brings up the next phase of this whole thing, which is even more interesting. I went out with this girl whose father was a Congressman, and I decided I was very lonely here to marry her. The law at that time, the immigration law, was that you had to marry the person outside of the country in order to apply for a visa then. So we decided that she’s going to come to Paris and I’m going to go to Paris, and we are going to get married and then apply for a visa. But I was drafted. I got 4A on the service and I so I just pulled out a letter. I went for an exam and in the meantime there was a guy writing articles in one of the Washington magazines and I worked with him because he was an expert in scientific service things and I wrote to him something, which I don’t remember what but he answered me…and here is the letter of what he answered, which I haven’t seen in a good number of years but here it is the associated press. You read it because you probably read it better than I do.  

SEAGRESS: Well why don’t you read it out loud. 

GODA: Okay. 

SEAGRESS: Mr. Goda is reading the response letter that he received then. 

GODA: So I asked him to look into my letter so I can go over to Paris and marry this girl. And then he wrote me back: Dear Mr. Goda. That is November 1st probably 1948, no ’47, no ’48. Well you certainly do have a problem but it appears you can now relax and go to Paris to marry your girl. I have it unofficially that you did not pass your physical. Of course even if you had passed it you still had a chance but God knows how much of [Unintelligible: 0:82:12] now you do me a favor will you when you get Paris and call the American embassy and ask to speak to Ms. Julie Barnes of the European Corporation Administration and when you get her on the phone tell her that Major [Nile] has an urgent message for her and that she is to write me immediately. Ms. Barnes is an old friend of mine and I will appreciate it more than you know if will do this favor. Now Thomas Nile good luck to you.’ That was a very important thing because I had a contact at the American Embassy but that comes also later. So I wanted to marry her and that was the only way to do it—to go to Paris. So I decided after this letter that I can go…and go to a passenger freighter to go over but luckily there was a strike and the whole east coast was closed except Baltimore and they called me in a hurry that I can go on American first class [laughs] if I want…an affair or whatever it was. Anyway I had a fantastic trip over to [Holland] and…but before this since I went to the Americanization school and we read [Roosevelt’s] article and in Mrs. Roosevelt said that the French children have no soap to clean themselves so the class decided that we are going to send the French children soap. So they decided this and they decided also to write a letter and everybody in the whole class signed it and I was the one who took it to Mrs. Roosevelt so I said okay I’m going to take it. So I went and arrived to Paris to get married. No we didn’t get married. I went to Mrs. Roosevelt’s office and there was a Mrs. Thompson there—who was a secretary—and I got an idea from this guy who had us…he was a friend of Roosevelt that he gave me the idea, ‘why don’t you ask Mrs. Roosevelt to be your witness. You have nobody in Paris. She would be a wonderful witness for you.’ So that’s what I did, and then when the wedding day came I got a telegraph from her ‘sorry I’m busy but blah, blah, blah, but I wish you the very best and if you need anything.’ I think I have the typewritten…anyway, we got married and I sat down and with my poor English I wrote a long letter that I want to go back because I want to continue my studies and in January the classes start and I sent it to her. I wrote it and sent it to her. Nothing happened and then I got a letter and I think its here. Immediately come to the Consulate and then by that time I had contacted this woman so I contacted her already, and so I went into the Consul’s office and I had very good eyes at that time and I saw my letter on his desk and it was true that was my letter and it was probably a few lines on the side from Mrs. Roosevelt and then in a couple of weeks I got my…got the visa for my wife. I got down there with a three year waiting period for an American citizen to bring up his wife, and I got it in two weeks or so.

SEAGRESS: What was your wife’s name?

GODA: Katherine Gyorki—that was her maiden name. 

SEAGRESS: Can you spell it? 

GODA: G-Y-O-R-K-I. So I married her in November and in Christmas we were skiing in the Alps and in January it came out, and we started our life. 

SEAGRESS: Did you go back to Washington? 

GODA: No, no, by that time my parents rented an apartment for us and we stayed with them for a short period of time and I started working. My wife started working and we had the apartment in Cyprus Hills at that time. 

SEAGRESS: Cyprus Hills? 

GODA: Cyprus Hills. 

SEAGRESS: Is that in Queens? 

GODA: That is on the border of Brooklyn and Queens. Actually it’s Brooklyn. At that time it was a good area. Today I don’t think it is. 

SEAGRESS: Tell me about getting a first job in America and how you went about doing that and any difficulties you had once you got there? 

GODA: That’s a good question. Well my first experience was when I was in Washington well because I stayed in Washington for several months in the summer of 1948 and I went to advertisement and honestly I don’t know how much it paid probably only a dollar an hour or something like this. And I got the job and I said to the person who hired me that before I’m going back to school. He [kicked] me out like that. 

SEAGRESS: What kind of job was that that you saw the advertisement for? 

GODA: Well I learned during the war tool and die making. 

SEAGRESS:  Oh uh huh. Tool and die making?

GODA: Tool and die making in Hungary you know during the ’38-39 period I learned for three years in our old factory and I learned it. So I don’t know what this job was I don’t remember but that’s what I was shooting for so I learned. And then when I got to New York I know that I was walking on the streets and I saw a sign that there’s a machine shop or something like this and I went in and asked and it happened to me that I was walking on Queens Boulevard and I went in and that wasn’t my first job. That was probably a second job, and I talked to the Hungarian guy, and he said ‘okay I’m going to hire you, how much did you get?’ I said ‘a dollar seventy-five an hour’ and he said ‘a dollar and seventy-five okay.’ So I learned a really important lesson here you know. He misunderstood or I said it wrong or I don’t know but anyway I got the job and it was very difficult. I got one after the other and got a little more here and there and then finally I got a scholarship from which was actually a C.I.A. run operation, again through connections, and they paid my tuition for graduate school. And I went to NYU and I got a Master’s degree in industrial management, which then changed everything of course. Because when I got my degree I could get an engineering job, which in the beginning it wasn’t easy but in 195…I said ’55 or ’56 I got a very good job and from then on I got better and better positions. 

SEAGRESS: Was there something about being in America that you didn’t like? Or something that was very difficult for you to adapt to?

GODA: Not really. 

SEAGRESS: You mentioned you had been lonely. 

GODA: Well I was very lonely at the beginning when I was in Washington. I tell you for several reasons. First of all 1948 was one of the warmest, hottest summer and at that time there was no air conditioners anywhere except for the Library of Congress, which wasn’t air conditioner but an ice-cool thing so I spent most of my time in the Library of Congress doing nothing. And we were sleeping on the edge of the Potomac because of this tremendous humidity and heat that goes in the government offices for a long period of time because every time it was over a hundred degree humidity they closed. It was a miserable, miserable summer. And beside and I went down to…I arrived. I’m going a little back…pedaling back…I arrived to Washington and I had to go to the Mall because I actually I was enrolled in the University of Florida, Miami, I don’t know. And I took a train down and I arrived in this heat of summer, in the spring rather, and I didn’t speak their language and I was there for a day or two and I said I had enough and I came back. The heat was the one that had changed it…

SEAGRESS: So that made a big impression just how hot…?

GODA: Yeah that was the… really the best part of everything. Otherwise I have no problems or no dislikes or special likes. 

SEAGRESS: You mentioned your father of course wanted to go back to Hungary initially.

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: But your mother didn’t. Why did she like it in America so much? 

GODA: She was much more progressive than my father and secondly I was here. And probably she saw the things coming more than my father. And my father was over there and wasn’t here. So they finally bought a Laundromat and they were running a Laundromat to make a living, which was a very tough business at that time. 

SEAGRESS: Right and of course as you say they had came from a good business. 

GODA: Yes, yes. 

SEAGRESS: Did you ever return to Hungary? 

GODA: Oh many times. 

SEAGRESS: When was the first time you returned to Budapest? 

GODA: I think it was my first in I think ’54 or ’55 no ’56 and we had a daughter. Then I remarried in 1960 and I married a Hungarian girl who came during the revolution and her mother was living in Hungary and as soon as possible we went to visit her, which was in I would say probably in ’68 or so, something like this, and from then on either we brought her out or we went every single year. 

SEAGRESS: What did it feel like the first time you went back to Budapest? What did it feel like? 

GODA: Terrible. Terrible. First of all we took our passports on the train and we were shaking like this that we were afraid that I’m not going to get it back and that was a full Communist regime at that time. But we had a real visa and everything was legal. Very scary, very scary. So scary that in the hotel we were not talking. We were afraid everything was bugged. It was quite unpleasant for example I went…I wanted to rent a car and soon enough they brought me a brand new car, and about three or four people came with it and I had to drive to see. They wanted to see that I can drive and finally they left and it turned out I had the car and the license plate on the car was the Hungarian Secret Service license. But anyway I had the car and I used it but they were so scared. You know they weren’t used to renting. Anyway the first time it was very scary but then you don’t know.

SEAGRESS: What was the name of your second wife? 

GODA: Veronica and her maiden name was Lamendorfs.

SEAGRESS: How do you spell that? 

GODA: L-A-M-E-N-D-O-R-F-S.

SEAGRESS: And you’d mentioned you had a daughter by your first marriage. 

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: What was her name? 

GODA: Susan. 

SEAGRESS: And did you have any children with your second wife? 

GODA: No only one for the first marriage. 

SEAGRESS: I see. Was your wife—you said her mother was still living in Hungary? 

GODA: Yes.

SEAGRESS: Was she living in Budapest or outside? 

GODA: Yes. Budapest. 

SEAGRESS: Did you ever bring your wife’s mother to live in America? 

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: Yes? 

GODA: Yes. 

SEAGRESS: What year did you finally bring her over to live? 

GODA: No just for several months. 

SEAGRESS: Oh but she never actually came her to live? 

GODA: No, not for good. Not for good. She was staying with us here. I’m here for thirty-four years in this apartment. 

SEAGRESS: In this apartment, wow. Well let me ask a couple final questions. 

GODA: Sure. 

SEAGRESS: One is at this point in your life as you look back, what are you the most proud of in your life? 

GODA: …Well I married my second wife and the relationship is personally for years. Unfortunately she died a year ago and she was very young and very beautiful. So I think that was…let’s see…one of my…secondly I was doing…I was making out very well financially and I had a manufacturing plant and I was doing extremely well and my wife became a stock broker and she was doing very well. 

SEAGRESS: So you had a good life together? 

GODA: Yeah, yeah. 

SEAGRESS: What personality traits in you are inherently Hungarian? 

GODA: Oh I’m tough I think. You know I have developed the cancer eleven years ago, and I’m fighting it since then. It’s…it didn’t bother me too much but its something I have to constantly concern with because I manage to survive the average. The average is about seven years and so far I’m eleven and a half and in the meantime you know my wife got cancer and she died. So life was very tough for me but I have been blessed with a few years, especially I developed another rare disease three years ago, which was terrible. So that’s right now that’s my problem to try to survive and try not to get an infection and things like this, and now that I’m alone its more difficult. 
 
SEAGRESS: But that Hungarian toughness holds you…

GODA: I think that toughness pulls me through—toughness pulls me through it. I have lots of friends that are very helpful and my daughter is fantastic. And I have a grandson, four and a half—a beautiful little boy. Picture is over there.  

SEAGRESS: And what’s his name? 

GODA: Ben. Benjamin. And they live down in Maryland so I don’t see them very often but occasionally. 

SEAGRESS: Before we end I was wondering if you could speak some Hungarian for us. 

GODA: About what? 

SEAGRESS: Well I realize it kind of puts one on the spot. Is there a poem or something that you could recite in Hungarian or…? I just want to get a few…you know a minute or so of you speaking Hungarian on tape. We should have recorded the telephone that you had on tape [laughs].

GODA: Mm-hmm. [Proceeds to speak Hungarian from 0:102:33 – 0:103:08]

SEAGRESS: Thank you. 

GODA: You’re welcome. Thank you. 

SEAGRESS: No what…what were you saying? 

GODA: Oh I was trying to recite a poem which I like which is about peace and peace and peace about a well known Hungarian poet who wrote this before a war, but unfortunately I don’t remember exactly the text because I haven’t read it for many, many years [laughs].

SEAGRESS: Who was the author? 

GODA: Mihaly Babits.

SEAGRESS: B-O-B…?

GODA: B-A-B-I-T-S. Yes Babits. He’s a well-known poet so. 

SEAGRESS: Well Mr. Goda I want to thank you very much. 

GODA: Paul, you’re very welcome. 

SEAGRESS: To talk to you like this for quite a while. 

GODA: Yeah. 

SEAGRESS: This is Paul Seagress signing off with George Goda on Thursday December 8th 1994 here in Manhattan. Again thank you. 

GODA: You’re very welcome.
