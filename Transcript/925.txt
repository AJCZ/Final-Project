krupa:	well it was house with 2 rooms, whole between and then under one roof. then there is like the storage room then there was the horses, then there was the cows and like on the end there was a garage where you chopped the wood and things like that see. but all under one roof. paul:	what was the house made out of? krupa:	homemade breaks out of mud and what did you call it when you trash the wheat all that ends. paul:	most stuff… krupa:	crush it up that was supposed to be the big support for the brick. paul:	what kind of roof did the house have on the top? krupa:	that time everybody had a straw. paul:	can you tell me a little bit about you made a straw roof? krupa:	yes i could tell you. you have to beat the wheat off it with like strong thing just the wheat and this got to be separate straight. then when it’s straight when you need for the roofing you make it like a bunch to the top you tie it tight. even then you take it half of it and twist that it’s really tight. when you have how much you’re imagining you needed you have the 2 by 4 on the roof and each one you take a piece of it and you tie it. you don’t need the nails, you use from what you have on that what would you call it bunches of what. paul:	bunches of stalk is what it is. krupa:	you know how it, yeah and you keep on going. you started from the bottom with the bottom down and then the rest of it with the top weak. you know that it lays over it hangs down and that’s the way you do it. paul:	how often would that have to be replaced? krupa:	well to its less good, but when fire come house next to house the town went puff. so not allowed no more. then they start to make homemade shingles, well that’s just as bad but it was supposed to be better. paul:	tell me how you heated the house?   krupa:	wood, you’re on wood if you have. paul:	with what, what did you burn the wood in? krupa:	you put in the stove, like coal stove you would call it here see. as far as baking bread they had brick oven. the oven was used to make homemade bread, so that was chimney for both. you connected from the coal stove and they would have that brick oven made like but in the house. paul:	how often would they make bread? krupa:	let’s say depends how big family is see, they usually make about 8 round bread big ones. see that it last but you eat so much bread there, so one is just for one day or it would have been. paul:	what kind of bread is this? krupa:	well this is rice and with the barley mixed together see. paul:	so the course bread they’re having… krupa:	yes see you have rice and then you have the wheat what you call here and then you have the barley. barley they have lot, they use that like for like you would say here for [inaudible 00:08:00] but bigger like small barley see. you could leave it for big, so all different things you make are of that. then when they have enough they sell it to the town to beer factory, see that i remember. then for the money right in the town they used to buy sugar. it was like a bullet like a missile that you chop it off. it wasn’t like now granulated that was it at the world war one see. paul:	tell me some other foods that you ate on a regular basis when you were a child? krupa:	well soup every day. paul:	how did they make soup? krupa:	they make soup whether it’s a bean soup and whether it’s lentil soup, pea soup and potato goes in everything. my grandmother used to say, “if you have potato and you have sold you’re not hungry.” you make everything. paul:	did you eat a lot of meat? krupa:	no listen you don’t go buy because you don’t have that much money. i remember my grandmother sent me with an eighth to buy vinegar. she didn’t have even for the vinegar enough to change to give me to go to buy the vinegar. so as far as meat your own pigs you raise, geese, chickens. paul:	did you slaughter your animals? krupa:	yes. paul:	tell me how you slaughtered the animals. krupa:	well the pigs well they were cut with the knife.  paul:	how would they do it? krupa:	knife you know they have stab it life. paul:	did your family do it or did your family don’t want to do it? krupa:	yes and through the war when there was no men from 18 to 55 even the women did. so my mother even killed a pig, how she done i don’t know but she done it. geese chicken doesn’t matter. if you were 15 years old you were supposed to know everything, go and do it the water is boiling and they chase you through the yard to catch the chicken kill it and there it goes. paul:	is there a piece of furniture that you remember very vividly from your house in czechoslovakia? krupa:	not really it looks more like almost homemade, they had dresser like fancy dresser for the girls when she gets married she gets right dresser. so many pillows and one big wheel feathers that’s why you have the geese. not so much for the meat because after you roasted the geese there is no much left fat. so you use the fat. when i was in europe after they were married and i had to go and we went to ceneterium in europe. you know what they gave you afternoon, slice of rice bread with a cold geese fat it was supposed to be healthy for you. paul:	what other uses did the fat have in the household, how else did you use the fat? you ate did you use it for any other? krupa:	sure yeah pork fat and if you have your own butter if you have cows. so they had butter but not to use it like fresh butter, they melt it see that it keeps in the dark room. there was no fridge in there, there was no ice but it kept. pork was always smoked good that it last. paul:	something that the family also did was smoke their own pork. krupa:	smoked yeah they made everything, there was everything every part of it. paul:	let me ask you what your father’s name was?

krupa:	not really i can’t remember anything. he was on the field and during the war like i say he was the foist one i think he was 42 that time, and he was captured in russia and he couldn’t get home. the war was over maybe about 2 years we thought he has forgotten and gone for good. then finally he said he couldn’t go home because there was so many turn over revolution. he said he was like on the farm working. when there was a red guard going through [inaudible 00:13:29] their owner the woman she come out with the red flag. when it light guard going she did the same thing. so he and other ones like escape it wasn’t like he was sent or allowed anything. he said he was more under the train hanging and when the train stopped behind the straw stalk he was hiding and he run after it. that’s how he got home. paul:	he literally escaped out of russian. krupa:	yes on the kind of trouble it was, it wasn’t like settled yet for something. paul:	tell me about what your father’s personality was like. krupa:	very quiet, i can never he wasn’t a drunkard just hard working farmer. paul:	what was, was there something that your father enjoyed doing for his own entertainment?

so that’s a big thing i know that it was. paul:	can you describe for me how a body was treated after somebody died, what did they do to the body? krupa:	they didn’t do nothing because he was so swollen that they had to put like pales under their casket in the extra room like we had 2 rooms. so he was pretty bad swollen. paul:	the body was then laid down in the house. krupa:	in the house now they haven’t done the cemetery they call it like for the dead like undertaker. paul:	like a wake. krupa:	yeah but it’s not undertaker it’s just a chapel and they made the body should lay in there. not like it used to be home. it was home all the time never any other way. paul:	then what happened after the body was in the house? krupa:	well then it’s like a procession going wherever you are the walking with the casket and praying and singing and that’s it.  paul:	were there any superstitions that you remember concerning the dead and how the dead were to be treated? krupa:	no not and that i don’t know nothing. paul:	do you remember any superstitions or anything like that from the old country? krupa:	no. paul:	things people… krupa:	nothing happen to me, so i don’t have anything to tell. paul:	tell me what your mother’s name was?

krupa:	no she didn’t, she no. well nothing to tell there is a midwife, you know what i mean and only thing i remember in the same room like i say only 2 rooms. they have a bed in the corner and special sheet is hanging like in the hospital when they cartons. because the kids everybody is in the same room. so that was the separation for the mother for the day or 2.     paul:	then one concession privacy. krupa:	yes that’s the whole and kids don’t listen they’re not to see it that’s the way it was. paul:	tell me a little bit about your mother’s background and where she came from? krupa:	well background i really don’t know much. i know she had to do everything herself, her mother must have died how early or how just before she was married i can tell you that. paul:	what was your mother’s personality like? krupa:	it was like strict she had to be. she had to be as a man take care of their job as a man. she have to take care of the whole whatever it was life whether it’s horses or chicken or that. you have to no pasture at all, everything is farm that is something growing there. there is no land that the cow could be outside, the cow had to be fed that you cut the straw and then clover or something in it. that was have to be cut every day and feed them they can be loose because there is no place to let them it would be doing some damage. that’s why i had the cows on the chain, see. because next trip is somebody else and here we have the wheat cut its bare that the cows could be here, maybe the clover is starting to growing of wheat. this guy has a corn here and beans growing bushes, of course the cow is looking on that bushes. i was the one i get blamed and i my mother would be called to town how much damage i made not the cow and you would get it. paul:	how did your mother punish you? krupa:	well hollow like hell and she would tell me that what she’s going to do to me or something and that hurts, i was imagining what they would do to me. paul:	tell me about did your mother do the laundry? krupa:	yes. paul:	how did people wash clothes back then? krupa:	yes i could tell you how they washed the clothes. when they have homemade linen, homemade it’s growing like wheat. you have to pull it out and whatever seeds that is going to be separate. then you soak it in the mud that it gets all rotten like see. then you wash it in the brook that it’s leaking there because it’s in the mud on the edge of it see. then you dry it and you have wooden holes like and this is scraped out and you put your thing cross and you chop it that you have space that you could break it into it. then you have, do you know like they have the hair dresser where they’re selling hair that comb that hit with the nails in it that you come through it. i see that in the store see and… paul:	this is like a scrub for combing more too. krupa:	yes you get all the woody part out shake it out, see you shake it out. when it’s so fine shake it out you 2 have different the nice tray that you have that’s for the linen and the bunches what it’s lumpy that’s to make like the feedbacks let’s say you know what i mean. paul:	for a rougher… krupa:	rougher stuff see. paul:	rougher stuff. krupa:	yeah and you spin it so you spin so much and they have such a thing to put it like the skin you call it here wool. you count how many threads and they make so many those skins and people comes who makes the linen see.  but before the thing is sent when you bake bread you have wooden things like you feed the birds let’s say. you put these skins in here and you take ashes, wood ashes that’s the breach i used to wash my hair in. you put the ashes on it and after they baked the bread that like steam it after they put it’s still hard enough, warm enough for that and that is breaching. then they brush it these skins under in the river that run through the town and you dye it. then the men come sit through the town he’s the one who makes the linen. how much he the measurement whatever that’s how many yards you get. they know how many yards you’re supposed to make out of that and you have the linen. you have for table clothes the men you used years ago they used to make a shirt even out of it and in broad it’s fancy.  so in sheets everything and when they wash it lot of big wash they put it in the like big kettle. they put that ashes on the clothes. not the ashes but they strain they put it in bag hot wool in it and over that. that’s the breach and you would be surprised how nice it comes out just everything homemade. like i said the roof was done never any nails and when the poles in the barn like it’s holding standing up. they drill holes and make nails that time but after the war everything is changing. now they’re almost fancier than we are here. paul:	tell me about what you wore for clothing when you lived in czechoslovakia.  krupa:	well clothing… paul:	what did it look like? krupa:	…everything is like the skirts and the big aprons and browses almost like you have a jacket ladies jacket now that was like it. paul:	what color were these clothes? krupa:	they were always like kind of darker color and fancy clothes everything in broader rate a lot of in broader. paul:	when would you wear fancier clothes? krupa:	sunday and special holidays, every sunday has a name one is bigger than the other not just a sunday. so you have to know that.  paul:	what religion were you? krupa:	catholic. paul:	describe for me how you celebrated christmas in czechoslovakia? krupa:	well in czechoslovakia well like before christmas we used to go to church 6 o’clock in the morning and that’s dark. of course when it comes to christmas eve that day you keep on baking and everything and special meal for that. paul:	what is the special meal that was…? krupa:	well the special meal is like the soup they call it like sourdough soup but if you don’t like it they make it a little different. but mushroom it’s got to be mushrooms in it and they call it like bunds. you baked the things your own homemade you put [inaudible 00:25:25] in it, you know that jerry. you put brown topping seed that’s the topping with butter and honey with boiling water. you know that bread makes the thing juicer like and we have those waffles like from the church. so you eat the waffles first, somebody comes with a christmas tree like and say they’re wishing. they used to send like young gets from the oldest. the oldest one was rest lastly, so that whether you wanted to or not they want to see how and they want to hear you. you say [inaudible 00:26:09]. fran:	praise be jesus christ. krupa:	yeah and wishing them everything good health and this and that, until it comes to the amen. but you’ve got to say everything that comes with it so that then you sit down and they make their own drink. like you would say you have whisky you don’t drink whisky. but you brought the sugar real good and you poured the whisky in it, you cooked it together. they put stick of cinnamon in it that it has flavor. it’s not so sharp after you do it, so they call it that’s the jesus drink see. so everybody gets a little drink and you get a cup of walnuts and you get apple. not everyday apples they have their own archest but not enough apples to go around all year that how much you want see. paul:	is there, was there special songs that you sang at christmas time? krupa:	oh! yeah. paul:	is there a song that you remember in czechoslovakia? krupa:	yes. paul:	can you sing a little bit of it for us on tape? krupa:	[singing]. see each day, each day go and go like [singing]. he was wrapped up in the however you say the diapers. [singing] she’s lacking him and [singing]. so that’s the song that every kid know it because that never goes off at christmas it’s always the same style, see. then you go through midnight mares see, and that’s it.        paul:	so christmas is a long drawn out kind of event. krupa:	oh! 3 days that’s terrible to make that feed for the cows for 3 days [inaudible 00:28:15]. paul:	i wanted to ask you, you mentioned earlier about your grandmother that you had. krupa:	yeah. paul:	was this your mother’s mother or father’s?

 krupa:	there was another girl.  paul:	was she from your town?  krupa:	going from the same town yeah. we were holding together even on the boat we were together.  paul:	so, you got the train where did the train go to?  krupa:	 [inaudible 00:40:53] that they comb their hairs and look for their bags or wherever they got and from there to prague, and the prague was quite a long time because we were waiting to there.  paul:	how long where you in prague?  krupa:	i can’t remember, it must have been few days if not week. then all that time so, in [holov 00:41:15] we were long.   paul:	so you from prague to [lohov 00:41:20] did you go?  krupa:	to there, havra i think yeah.  paul:	you said that you had some examination of your heroin first place, what else did they examine if any?  krupa:	maybe i had some physical i know we had it in prague.  paul:	where did you stay when you were in prague?  krupa:	that’s already for this people. it’s a station but this are the agents because you don’t know why i’m i here? where i’m i going? you don’t ask nobody, he comes and he calls your name so they have it.  paul:	they have a big facility that’s reserves for people who are immigrating.  krupa:	before you buy the ticket for the steamer, they have section with a name but which one do you go. so, i guess whoever sent the deposit they already called their name. they send them note to this home that they should come.  when you come there, i suppose they find the train how do i know where to go. see they already know how many people are coming so he is gathering his people that he has raised and you just follow him.  wherever he takes you, you stay there whether it’s days or just overnight. then finally like you would say for that reason, we are going to the consular they say. everybody who is supposed to get it or they are about giving to this people whether they were just from czechoslovakia you just follow it till you get to the desk, where your name is called again. then he took you back there but i have no idea.  paul:	so, you are totally in the hands of this team shit agent?  krupa:	no matter where i went nobody was there that i know who is waiting for me, see you don’t.  paul:	so, you go from prague to france to [luhab 00:43:14] how long where you there in france?  krupa:	like i say they even borrow the clothes for church what i had. so, i must have been there one sunday for sure because i think one sunday we went the way we were, we want to go to church god forbid to forget it.  paul:	do you remember anything about the trip from prague over to france?  krupa:	no, you just sit, i guess you sit in the train quiet till they tell you get off, how do i know where to get off?  paul:	then did you get on the ship in the harbor?  krupa:	yeah.  paul:	what was the name of the ship?  krupa:	it was a french.  paul:	tell me what you thought when you saw the ship.  krupa:	see, the thing was like this from home i don’t know how come that this agency they got the name. the sent 300 grand deposit and when we got to the agency that already you could see him but i don’t know who he is. but there were two people visiting from this country and they were coming back and they say to us, “what line you going and who is the name of the agency?” we say, we said the name oh my god! how can they be there together? are you going in the bathtub you know good for nothing ship. so, all the girl ride away we talk to them we say, well we have deposit the, to lose the money what would my mother say we say, don’t even know that find that you are here, don’t pay any attention to him.  then we ask him well, how can we go another? so, they say they are going with this other friend in five and a half day. so, they must smell something so that’s how we went there and we never mentioned that we there to that guy that they sent deposit. so, then i wrote my mother from lansford what happened, no he sent that back the 300 grand.  paul:	i’m just curious, do you remember what ship you were supposed to go on?  krupa:	no, only the agency [janet choz 00:45:32] like with the c with the thing on janet choz.  paul:	it’s quite a memory too.  krupa:	yeah.  paul:	the name of the agent.   krupa:	yeah, but how he lugged whether the old men or young men or whether he had somebody already there.  paul:	weren’t you glad you listen to those people?  krupa:	oh boy!  paul:	tell me about the el france what, can you just tell me on the big ship for me?  krupa:	that was a big steamer.  paul:	was that the first ship that you had ever seen?  krupa:	that’s i never see even a keep putting boat on edge of the thing.  paul:	tell me what you thought about when you saw the ship and realized that you went on to this thing.  krupa:	i was imagining it’s got to be big, get it in a more they used to call it the ocean in europe. so, that was fine we were going up and down the steps.  paul:	where did you sleep on the ship, describe.  krupa:	we were four in the cabin.  paul:	can you describe the cabin for me?  krupa:	dark, i think we had sink between the bed i don’t remember the toilet or anything like that. that i don’t remember, i know the sink was there and for girls. when it was time to eat, you go up wherever the dining room was, you come down and you stay there. after you were allowed to go on the top or either i go with somebody or they take us that you have to go up a little bit, that i don’t remember.  paul:	do you remember anything that sticks out in your mind that happened while you were on the ship? some of that that might have occurred.  krupa:	they were calling their names and one of the agent here said, all these are the ones that all come with the wire down over, over, over. everybody was like let him say porugsky over cashed up, everybody was like that.  so, he was making fun of their names and everybody was like that and for what? why he was calling the people on the top and they were just sitting around i don’t know. whether they could do some games or something i have no idea.  paul:	was it a smooth voyage or a rough voyage.  krupa:	it was, they were saying that it goes like 28 things up and down, it was couple days but not much.  paul:	did you get sea sick?  krupa:	maybe a little bit but i was going, i was pretty good. i wasn’t really doctoring or lying in bed but you feel like you were sick. so, you go to grey you know that they don’t ask you that you go according to your money i suppose that’s it. i didn’t have any doctor that i would be seen sick that’s all.  paul:	did they offer any kind of entertainment for you while you were on the ship?  krupa:	no, i don’t remember anything only i know that we went up on the air.  paul:	do you remember any other passengers entertaining themselves in any way?  krupa:	no, i’m sitting around and you go to the table. i don’t remember whether you had your same place to sit over they are available you come sit down like everybody together. i know it was a long table that we were sitting eating.  paul:	how long where you on the ship itself? i know that you left your town on august 24th.  krupa:	well, five and a half days.  paul:	five and a half days you were on the ship?  krupa:	i guess this team was going to sail today so if it’s already there, they gather us together and the papers you finish, put a stop and examination otherwise you won’t get there, that’s got to be done before that see.  paul:	do you remember seeing the statue of liberty when you came into new york harbor?  krupa:	i guess i did, i don’t remember because statue of liberty you could see from the big thing. you hear your surprise, you only watch front of yourself or the people rather than leave you there or something you are scared. after i was inside, we were inside we therefore left to be careful with them. these are the, we can’t let them go they have nobody to go to yet till they picked them up.  paul:	you are talking about ellis island?  krupa:	yes.  paul:	so, the ship comes into new york harbor and then what happened once the ship docked?  krupa:	when the ship docks, the ferry is there. the porters were getting their suitcases who wants help. whether you wanted help i didn’t know what you are saying i guess, he was talking to me and gave me the number for the suitcase and get it done. i was holding on to the feathers can you imagine, no comb, no towel, no toothpaste no change what did i sleep in as i was? i don’t remember that.  paul:	so, the ferry took you over to ellis island?  krupa:	yeah.  paul:	then what happened when you got to ellis island?  krupa:	walk with the people.  paul:	what did it look like?  krupa:	it looks like a big station or big hole or whatever you would think. something big, to me everything was big because i never wasn’t even to see anything bigger than my house.  paul:	were there lots of people there or?  krupa:	yeah, and they were coming even the colored people, that was i say my god! they look so big and i look so small because i wasn’t big.  paul:	had you ever seen a black person before?  krupa:	no, yes i see the chimney sweeper.  paul:	he was black overly accidentally.  krupa:	yeah, he had a thing that for ears he’s wearing the same thing and that thing ringing that he scrub the thing and he stands in front of the oven, big oven that you bake and that it’s a space like this see. the say you could put your stuff on it here you are cooking summer time and here you have the thing when they kill the pig that you put the copper big thing.  the cowboys used to cook on the outside, that big things are going cooking when we doing the butchering. he stand on it that here you have the boot down the knee, he stands here and he put his big broom made out of the branches you would say. he stands there and he wiggle it up and all that stuff falling down.  then there is big girls like teenagers he say hello, he mocks them and little kids are afraid of it. when he goes they always run and he’s got a sleeping on back on it and his food is all black. we say wait, the chimney man is coming i’m going to give it to him if you don’t behave yourself. well that’s terrible black men like that.  paul:	right well let’s back to ellis island now. so what happened back on ellis island? krupa:	isn’t that enough? paul:	no we’ve got to get to what exactly, yeah you still on ellis island. what happened exactly at ellis island, do you remember what did they do you mentioned your eyes? krupa:	well finally when that cousin got i guess know this, so her husband that i had never seen before because she got married in this country see. so i hear the name and that was like shock to me that touch me good. so after they were finish with him they call me to sit down and talk, why did leave the country i say, “people finish with this kind of work and my mother say that i guess they don’t need me or something.” well that’s it. he had the rest of it already done but i was supposed to put down it was there, so not much at all.  paul:	so how long were you at ellis island? krupa:	well i think we came friday and being a saturday and sunday not doing any work that’s why i was there. whether it came thursday i can be sure only it seems awfully long. paul:	but you stayed overnight there. krupa:	a couple of nights that’s for sure.   paul:	do you remember where you slept at ellis island? krupa:	well i know those bank beds like bed next to bed up there at all the time. not one room or 3 room, the whole thing let’s say from here to there less more. paul:	did they feed you while you were at ellis island? krupa:	oh! yes. paul:	how was that experience like? krupa:	well i don’t even know what we had for breakfast but the whoever it was she had a stick and she went on to bed. you would go next to her and fence with a stick rub and turn it that’s only there. you should know that come on that she was calling you, she didn’t call see. you follow her and you go dining room i guess it wasn’t far it was there. so everybody eat together. paul:	did you see anything at ellis island that you had never seen before in europe? krupa:	no only there inside because i don’t think i was inside. only you were inside evening we were sitting they were playing like some kind of maybe records or whatever it was. they gave us a cup of milk before the bed time like right there in that hall to everybody see and you went to bed. paul:	were there nationalities that you had never been exposed to before? krupa:	sure from all different countries i suppose they were there people. you don’t know nobody only that girl i know but she went because she was older and she was to new york city so we separate. once you hit between the door all the steamer and the doctor finish you go back on the ferry if you have people there waiting for you, see. if they’re not waiting by the ferry by the steamer like the ferry comes from new york city let’s say. these people who went to new york city so they would go back on the ferry whoever was waiting for them. if you’re old enough you have after you show them somebody poke you take this.  my husband when he was coming he went to 14th street and he couldn’t go because he wasn’t already out from the army.  paul:	how did you feel when they separated you from this young lady who was your travelling companion? how did you feel about having to stay there? krupa:	i didn’t know when she disappeared, like i say you go one after another between the door you’re no pushing you’re going to the doctor i say they don’t let 3 or 4 between the door. one after another. once you pass i didn’t know where she disappeared if she went in front of me and if she went behind me. when i was alone i got to go when they push me, see that’s the way it was. paul:	do you remember if you felt frightened about being there by yourself or you really weren’t frightened? krupa:	i was frightened only that i had to stay there and i’m in this country already. i didn’t know why, all i was thinking that they’re going to send me back. nobody explained it to me why or you’re going to go home soon they’re going to pick you up. nobody talk to you, see. you just sitting there you don’t know what’s going to happen to you see.       paul:	so your cousin’s husband… krupa:	pick me up. paul:	…came to get you. krupa:	yeah. paul:	do you remember what your impressions were of this man? krupa:	nothing not much. i don’t think i say hallo or glad to see you. i did nothing, he just see a kid front of him and follow him back to the ferry and to this people in new york city. i remember they all went up and the street was so dark. so the house is so close there. so that was his people i didn’t question him nothing, you just keep quiet.    paul:	did he speak your language? krupa:	yeah sure. paul:	did he try to be friendly with you? krupa:	he wasn’t a much talker. just what we had to and i stand next to him you can imagine high shoes and the house dress the people gave me wanted to leave me my sunday clothes what i came from.  so they wanted change me they want to be good to be more like the rest of it. i can imagine they had the flu down. next morning the cousin kid 4 years old he was playing football with it and i felt so bad. i said, “i have to bring the clothes back to the people.” oh! don’t worry about it, they gave you something that they don’t need it anymore.   paul:	tell me how you spent your first night?
