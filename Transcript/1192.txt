NASH: This is November 30, 1973. I am visiting Mr. Louis Israel Nash who lives in Manhattan and came to the United States from Lemburg, Austria in the year 1900. Mr. Nash is going to be 92 on his next birthday and Mr. Nash is going to tell us the story of how he immigrated to the United States. Mr. Nash, tell us something about Limburg. L. NASH: Well, Lemburg was a city under the control of Austria. Every time there was a war of any kind, Lemburg had the most of it. Why, I don't know, but that is the history of it. It is a nice big city with a fairly normal population, not without any water connections. The only water we had was lakes. It was pools made, there were no lakes. I was graduated, finished public school and went to work. M. NASH: How big was your family? L. NASH: My family is my parents and three children. I was the oldest. My mother had lost five children before me. When I was 19 years of age, I had a job where I earned the most money of any boy my age. This was the only one of its kind in the entire city. I had contact with the most elite people in the city. M. NASH: What did you do? L. NASH: I was hired to take care of sales, retail sales, but I also had to do the clerical work which the owner, who was a widow about forty five or fifty years old, who had a partner, who lived with her partner, and she insisted that work should do done in her home. Every time I went there and then I came back to the store, he found fault with me, criticizing me why I had to go there to do the work, why I couldn't do it in the store and she was fighting that it must be done. That made me very uncomfortable. As a result, since I knew that I couldn't get any other work there where I could earn even half as much as I earned there, I decided that I must go to a bigger city. At that time the best I thought of was Vienna or Berlin. My mother couldn't think of it because I was the oldest child. And finally two of my father's friends, tailors, were going to America. My father always spoke in favor of America because he said that people in America are so honest that even the jewelers leave their window display in that the stores had nothing else but glass doors to close and nothing happens while in pour city we have metal doors with two and three locks. These two men who were tailors who had sons here already doing very well agreed to take care of me and teach me the trade when I got here. That my mother was kind of favorable of. And to make sure that in case anything goes wrong between those two men and myself, I also had an address of a couple who had no children that lived next door to us and they liked me very much. When they were going to America which was about two years before, they told my mother that anytime I should go to America myself, to be sure to go to them. They will take care of me. I also got thirty dollars of American money in preparation in case anything goes wrong. When we got here on January 1, 1900, I think it was a Wednesday. M. NASH: Let's go back a little bit. I would like to know a little bit more about your preparation for going and what the trip was like. What was the name of the boat, do you remember? L. NASH: Well, there wasn't much to the trip because my tickets were ready to go to Berlin and from Berlin to get on the boat which was the Rotterdam. M. NASH: What class did you travel? L. NASH: Third class, naturally. And if you want to know how we lived through it... M. NASH: Yes. L. NASH: On that trip I was the only person in the entire boat, first class and third class, that was not sick. I ate up almost everybody's food that we brought with us. outside of that, I have no special recollection of the trip. M. NASH: Did you go to Ellis Island when you arrived? L. NASH: Yes, I am coming to that. When we got to Ellis Island, we were divided in accordance with the initials, with our names, initials. When my name was called, I was asked, "Who are you going to here?" I explained that I came with two men who were supposed to take care of me. They looked up the records and found that those two men were sent to Cleveland right after Ellis Island. So I had this address of that couple... M. NASH: In other words, those men had already left? L. NASH: Yes. They were sent right from there. There were tickets for them and they went to Cleveland. So I had the address of the couple and I also told them that I had 30 dollars in American money in cash. They called over a man, turned over my luggage to him and sent me to that couple. When we got there the woman nearly fainted and said my who was the best known baker in the city have their store in the next block. M. NASH: In Lemburg? L. NASH: No, here. I should go there. Before I left, my mother asked me to be sure not to depend or ever find in necessary to ask for any favors from my aunt, but here I was. I had no other alternative but going where this woman had sent us. Well, we got there, my aunt got all excited. She was angry why I didn't let her know that I was coming. She would have taken care of me. Took me quite a job to explain to her how I came and why this woman sent me over. I asked here, I didn't understand why this woman acted so strange when she when she always before they left for America, she asked my mother to be sure that I should come there and my aunt didn't know , couldn't explain, but she said people maybe people have boarders, she didn't have any room for you. Well, that was the best explanation I could get. My aunt sent out to buy a mattress which was put on the floor. That was the way she could accommodate me. When everything was set, after dinner I asked my aunt how I can get a job, what shall I do. She said if you buy a Jewish paper, they have ads of different works. The next day, I bought the Targablut and I saw an ad that said, "Paper box makers wanted. Learners will also get paid." I showed this to my aunt and she said, "Oh, that is only two blocks from here." her store was on Ludlow Street and this was on Orchard Street. I walked up the two blocks and my initials were the same as the initials here. I looked at the sign and I saw Orchard. Well, I didn't understand that this meant Orchard. I waited until a policeman came over and I asked him. He didn't understand what I asked. He took me over to a cigar stand on the corner who was Jewish. I showed him the ad and he said that is right next door in the basement. I went down there and showed them the ad. He said, "Alright, come to work on Sunday." I went home, told my aunt I got a job as a paper box maker and I will get paid from beginning. M. NASH: Was the reason that you worked on Sunday because he was Jewish and he didn't open on Saturday? L. NASH: Yes, he was closed on Saturday. On Saturday night I was impatient. I wanted to be sure that I wouldn't miss it on Sunday. I told my aunt I'm going up to look to see if the place was still there. Sure enough when I got there, it was light and I saw him working. I went down and what I saw him doing I asked if I could help him. He was satisfied. He showed me what to do and he was satisfied the way I did the work, but after an hour I got scared that my aunt wouldn't know what happened to me so I explained to him and I went back home. Sunday morning when I came there I already knew what to do. I worked the whole day. He was satisfied with what I was doing. I did the work just as it was necessary, but I also saw a man working at the other end doing some very high class work by comparison. During the day when I had a chance, at 6 o'clock when my work was through I went and i asked him what he was doing. He told me. I asked if I could help him. He was satisfied and even showed me how to help him, and I worked till 10 o'clock and from there on every day I worked till 6 o'clock on my job and after that I worked with him until he stopped, 10 sometimes 11 o'clock at night. At the end of the week came, tuesday, payday, I saw him paying everybody but me. I asked him how come. He said, "Well, you didn't bargain with me." I said, "Alright, thank you, I wouldn't come to work anymore." "Oh," he said, "No, I want you to come to work, I like what you were doing. I'll give you a dollar a week." I said, "No." And so I was stubborn until he reached three dollars. When he reached three dollars I got scared. I didn't think I ought to ask for more. I agreed. For that week he wouldn't pay me nothing. At the end of the second week I got three dollars from him and two dollars from the other man who was working piece work and i helped him. So already I had five dollars. But I realized that I think I should get more money. I told my man that unless I get more money I wouldn't come to work the next day. He agreed to pay me five dollars without question. At the end of the second week I got five dollars from him and I got five dollars from the piece worker for helping him. By that time I already knew how to do his work, that I could even take that job. That was three weeks. On the fourth week there was no more work. My boss said to me he doesn't want me to leave, but if I will stay for three dollars a week, I should stay and wait until he gets more work. Well, I didn't originally come here to be a paper box maker. I didn't know weather that could develop into a big business. I came here to be a tailor. My uncle's stepbrother who was working in skirt factory and I spoke to him at different times, I asked him if I couldn't go there and try to learn how to make skirts the way he did. He said he would talk to his boss. He did and told me to come there Saturday night. When I got there Saturday night the man said, "Alright, get a machine and work two weeks free and I'll teach you." I already had my experience with the paper box man. I said, "I don't work free. If you will agree that I will get a machine because that was the custom that every operator had to bring his own machine, I'll leave it to you at the end of the week how much I earned, but I must get paid from the beginning on." His wife was there. He didn't want to agree with it, but I seemed to have appeal to her. She liked the way I proposed to him and she begged him to let me have it. Sunday morning, he gave me two addresses where to hire machine, Sunday morning I went to those two places and neither one of them gave me a machine for three weeks. I went back to ask what could be done. When I got there I saw two machines standing idle. I said, "Well, can't I use one of those machines?" He said, "Yes, you could, but those are old-fashioned ones." "Well," I said, "I have no alternative. I'll try to work on an old-fashioned one." He showed me how to thread it, gave me a box of rags, I worked for about two hours sewing rags together, then I went over--he never came near me--I went over and said, "Look, here are all the rags you gave me and how I sewed them together. If there is any corrections, show it to me and if not, give me regular work, something to do. He found no fault so he gave me some work to do which I did. Then he did come almost every half-hour to see what I was doing and he was satisfied. At the end of the week-- after 6 o'clock everybody was leaving and he was staying there so I asked him what he was doing and he showed me. I said, "Can I help you?" And so for the whole week I worked until 6 o'clock on the work that he gave me. After 6 o'clock I helped him what he was doing. Saturday night I went there because I knew that he would be there and he gave me two dollars with strict instructions to be sure never to mention it to anybody, otherwise, I will spoil his whole business. And to prove that I am taking advantage of him, he said, "You see this man, which was my uncle's brother, brought his brother two weeks ago and I am still not going to pay him and now you are getting paid from the beginning. I promised after the second week, I already did make skirts like everybody else only I wasn't taught the finishing. I asked him to teach me how to finish. He promised to do it the next week. His wife was there again and she was happy to hear the results, and during the discussion between him, his wife, and myself, she suggested that I should go look for a place that does better work, higher priced work. This was the cheapest kind of skirts that were being made, cotton skirts. He didn't like the idea, but the way she appealed to him in my favor, he kind of thought it would be a good idea for my sake although he didn't like it. And he promised that he would teach me how to finish skirts and he would also talk to a neighbor in the same building who was doing better work to see if I can get a job there. I worked with him for the third week. During the time we talked to the fellow in the building and he kind of thought he could give me a job. I finished working for him the third week, he gave me five dollars, and for the fourth week I was supposed to go to the other place. By that time my machine that I had ordered was due so it was delivered to the other place. And when I got there he gave me some of his poor work to work on which he was satisfied, and I was very slow at it, but he was satisfied with what I was doing. There too, when it came in the evening, after 6 o'clock everybody left, I asked him what he was doing, would he mind if I helped him, he agreed, and I used to work there every night 10, 11 o'clock, helping him for free. But for what I did in the skirt work he helped me to improve so that at the end of the week i got twelve dollars. This was piece work. I was there exactly three weeks. On the second week when I worked in the paper box and I got ten dollars, I came to my aunt and I told her that since I know that I can earn money, it would be a good idea if I find a place to live in. She said that was a good idea and since she told me that the woman which I was supposed to go to originally might have boarders, I went there first and that is when I learned it was true. She admitted to me that since she came to America, her husband was sick and couldn't get a steady job and they lived mostly on the three boarders that she had and that took all the room that she had and she didn't want to admit to me at that time, but this time she admitted all this to me and told me she has no room, but I should go to another place. And I went to the other place that she recommended. My rent was three dollars a week including breakfast and laundry. In accordance with my earning, I was a rich man. I could even save money. And so it was between the paper box maker and the first job that I had with the skirt and the second job that I had as a skirt operator, I already saved up fifteen dollars and I knew that all I needed was six dollars to live on, so whatever I had left over I sent home. I was there three weeks and it looked like I was going to start making a lot of money and there was no more work, which shouldn't scare me although I had always sent away all the money, but I still had thirty dollars which I never touched. This was a reserve. That morning I lost the thirty dollars. I am sure even today that either one of the boarders or even the woman whom I lived with picked my pockets because I couldn't have lost it in the street the way I had it in my pants pocket and that day we had about ten inches of snow and I couldn't have, I never put my hands into the pants pockets my entire walk from where I lived to where my shop was, so I couldn't have lost it anywhere and still I didn't have it when I got there. Here I was, no work, no money. I knew already how to look for a job. I took the paper and it said, "A butcher boy wanted, can be a greenhorn, but must be a butcher from the old country." I decided I am going for that job although I never saw meat outside of to eat it. I never saw a butcher in my city, and the butcher in our city was supposed to have been graded to the lowest of citizens. But I have to get to work right away. Five o'clock in the morning I got up, got on the trolley car. This was on Second Avenue and 90th Street. When I got there the place was still closed. It was good and cold but I had to wait. A few minutes later a truck came over, took a part of an animal, the door was open, he opened the door, went in, put it on a hook, and then he went and got some other stuff, put it on the counter and said to me, "Are you waiting for the job?" I said, "Yes." Well, he said, "You can go inside and sit down. The boss lives in the back of the store. He will be out soon." And so I did. A few minutes later the boss came out and said, "You are looking for the job?" I said, "Yes." "Are you a butcher boy?" He took over the meat from the hook and he said, "Take it apart." I said, "Wait a minute. You may be doing it differently than I was doing it at home. Show me how you are doing it. Show me how you are doing it and I will copy. He did and I watched very carefully. When he got through taking the meat apart and came to the bone, he said, "Well, this you know how to do." Well, I was afraid already to say no. I took that bone and with the saw, he gave me a saw, and 90 percent of the sawing went on my left arm. I didn't know how to hold the saw in my hand and I never knew a bone, but I managed it. I cut myself apart a good deal. He laughed and I said, "I'm too nervous. I would like the job and I am trying to do the best but I'm too nervous." He took that as an excuse. After a week's time I was able to do everything the way he did, just as good as he did. He liked me, the wife liked me, there were two children there, and she had two brothers that were still in high school. I got acquainted with them and they started teaching me English. M. NASH: Where were they from? L. NASH: Russian. M. NASH: Russian Jewish? L. NASH: Well, you want to have a joke on that too? M. NASH: Alright. L. NASH: I'll give it to you. She had two brothers and I got acquainted with them and they started teaching me Russian. My first job was food, board, and ten dollars a month. On Friday nights we had the meal which was usual, chicken soup and noodles. The soup was too cloudy to me, and I asked her how she was doing it. She didn't know what I was asking. I said, "Well, there is so much flour in this soup?" She said, "Nothing, I made the noodles and I put them in." I said, "My mother didn't do it that way. My mother, when she made the noodles, she first cooked the noodles and threw that water away and then she used the noodles clean for the soup." For the moment she was not satisfied, but the next Friday she did what I told her and they were all happy that this meal looked much different, more appetizing. I got so used to those people and they liked me so much that I almost thought that I would become a butcher, although I knew if my mother would ever hear that I was a butcher she would die. I was there for three months, exceedingly happy. Everything was going my way and every month when I got ten dollars I mailed it home because everything I needed for personal use, like cigarettes or carfare for Saturdays to go down town, I made it in tips. At the end of the third month he came home one day all excited and started scolding my why I went to look for a job. I never did, I never dreamed it because I would either go back to the skirt operator or I was going to remain a butcher, and to remain a butcher I was so happy with them I wouldn't think of anything else. When he insisted I was looking for a job elsewhere, I got hurt, hurt so badly that I said, "Well, if that is what you insist on, you will never trust me anymore and I wouldn't be happy here anymore. I am going to look for a job." And the next day I looked for an ad, "Butcher boy wanted, must know how to drive a horse." I went for that job. This was on 125th Street. I worked for a kosher butcher, this was not a kosher butcher, but I told him, "I can't come until Saturday night. I must give my man a week's notice to get himself another boy." I liked the job too much to walk out on he unexpectedly. "Yes," he said, "but how do I know you will come?" I said, "I'll give you a deposit." I went home, got a pair of pants, brought it to him, gave it to him as a deposit that I was coming there Saturday. I told my man to get a boy. Whether he did or not I don't know, but it came Saturday, I packed up my stuff and I said, "I'm leaving." He didn't say anything, and I was for the moment surprised that he would he would just let me go without saying anything. When i got to the other place the man didn't recognize me. I said, "Wait a minute." I said, "You have my pants as security that I was coming here." And he sw the way I was insisting, he said, "Alright, come in the back." The two went in the back of the store and he explained to me, he said, "Your boss, when I asked him for a reference as you told me to, begged me not to take you, and he appealed to me. He wants you back, he doesn't want to lose you. The reason why that way is because he wanted to give you a raise and he didn't know how so he put it up to you to demand a raise and since you didn't demand a raise, he just didn't want to lose you and he begged me not to take you so I got myself another boy." "Well," I said, "that is very nice of you and it is very nice of him too, but I have a deposit here, I have a job here, you don't have to hire me, I'm going to get paid." "Oh,' he said, "if that is the case, and that is the recommendation you have, I'm going to get you a job." He went right to the telephone and he called up another man and he told him exactly the situation and he said, "If you need a boy, here is a good one." And he needed one to drive a horse. He said, "I've got you a job in a kosher butcher, so it will be more to your liking." And he went right out, took his truck and drove me up to 156th Street, I think it was. This man accepted me and he said, "We haven't got much work on Sunday, only deliveries, so we will clean up now and then in the morning I will go with you to make the various deliveries." Sunday morning came, the horse and wagon came in front of the store, we picked up the deliveries and he showed me exactly where to go, what to do and how to go about it. The next morning he said to me, "Well, go ahead." The stable was two blocks away from there. He said, "Go and hitch up the wagon and I'll give you deliveries for this morning." Well, I never knew how to drive a horse. I was never behind one, but I wouldn't admit to him. I went to the stable and sure enough, there was a Russian in charge. I gave him a dime and I said, "Here is for a can of beer. Hitch up the horse and wagon for me," which he did. I drove in the front of the store, he gave me the deliveries, I made the deliveries, came back, everything was satisfactory. The work in the shop I knew so well that there was no question brought up. M. NASH: Were you able to drive the horse? L. NASH: Never drove a horse in my life before. M. NASH: But at that time you learned? L. NASH: Well, from then on. The next day I didn't think I was going to give that man ten cents every day to hitch up the wagon, so I gave him ten cents and I said, "Let me see how to do it myself." He did and so for about another two days I would still give him ten cents to stand by to see that I do it right. Everything was satisfactory. I worked there three weeks, and the man admitted to me then that he was surprised, I was the only boy that could stay there long on account of the horse. He said everybody he had, and he told me his life's history, that he was a rich man, lost his business, and had to give everything up, but he didn't want to give up this horse which he still has. This horse was a trotter, not used to be driven with a wagon behind him, with a heavy truck behind him, but I did so well that he was overjoyed. I did so well because I didn't know how. Whenever I had to make a delivery I tied the horse up either to a lamp post or a water hydrant. The other boys never did. That is why they had trouble. Either the horse ran away with them or he kicked somebody, and with me everything was fine. So, I was happy again. I got a new job, the family was nice, although they lived upstairs and I lived downstairs. But everything was wonderful. The month ended, I got fifteen dollars, and I had nice tips over there, too. I sent that money home. This was in the middle of the week. On Saturday, he said to me, "You know what," on Saturday morning I got up, got myself dressed, intending to go down town to meet some of the people that I knew and also to see if I can't get back into the skirt operating. He comes down when I am all dressed ready to go, and says, "Go and hitch up the horse to a carriage. I have a carriage and I will take you along riding with the family." I said, "I'm sorry. I am all dressed, to go and hitch up your horse." He said, "You don't have to, you can do it like this." I said, "No, I value my clothes too much to dirty myself in hitching up a horse and I am not interested in your ride. He got all excited and he said, "If that is the case, you have no job." I said, "Alright." I went down town and immediately went to the woman where I had lived before and I told her I am coming back tonight to live if she has room for me. She gave me the key to come in because I told her I may come in very late. She gave me the key to come in and at night I went there to get my clothes, the women were sitting plucking chickens, which was the usual custom for Saturday night, that she and I would pluck the chickens for the week, and she started crying, begging me not to leave. I said, "No, I only get discharged once. I was discharged once and I am through." Of course, I was independent because wherever I was, I was liked. He wouldn't say a word. He got so mad that when I finally got all packed--no, she begged me so I said, "I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll do you a favor. I will help you pluck the chickens tonight, clean it up for you, but I am positively leaving, I am not going to stay." I did, the way the way I learned to do that work, I did it better than she did. Everybody was satisfied. When we were through, I went back, dressed myself again, packed up my valise, ready to go. He was so mad he wouldn't pay me, which he owned me for about four days, which made it worse. Probably if he had paid me, and he would have asked something, I would have remained because I had asked down town and they told me they didn't have ant work yet, so I figured I would stay another few weeks , but since he was so mad and he wouldn't say anything, I left. Sunday morning, I took the paper looking for a job. There were none. Monday, by that time I already knew how to read an English paper, I looked at the English paper, no job. M. NASH: What year was this all happening, still 1900? L. NASH: 1900, Monday I already looked in the English paper, no job. Tuesday there were two kinds of jobs, they didn't fit, didn't fit. One doctor wanted a boy, that I didn't know how to, and the other job i didn't understand. But I had no money. I said to my woman where I was boarding, I said, "You know my condition. You may have to trust me until I get a job." "Oh," she said, "No, that I can't afford to do, I can't afford to trust anybody. You have a rich aunt. Go to her, let her lend you money and you stay." I said, "Oh, no, I don't go for my aunt and I'm not going to stay here. I'll have to take care of myself." I went to grocers and butchers and asked them if there was a chance of making some deliveries where I could get a tip. One grocery man told me, Thursday and Friday he has enough extras that he may need an extra boy. The butcher, nobody had a need for anyone for deliveries. I asked a woman if she would permit me to leave my valise there. This she agreed to, and thinking that maybe I will wind up going to my aunt, but I didn't, I slept in the park. On rainy days i slept in the basement. There was a free bath house on Delancey and Essex Street. You could get up--for towels and soap you have to pay. So I got another shirt and underwear instead of a towel without soap. Once in a while I picked up a piece of soap there from somebody else. I washed--when I got through wiping myself, I washed the shirt and underwear and there was a kindly old man in charge of the bath house and he was satisfied when I explained to him my condition, to take care of my watch. I hung it on the roof and he saw to it that it shouldn't get lost. For three week, this was my life. On Thursday and Friday I would make a couple of pennies. There was no work anywhere, not in the skirt factories, the paper box man went out of business. There was nothing else that could be done. On Riverton Street between I think Orchard and Ludlow, Between Orchard and I don't remember exactly what street it is, but it is on Riverton Street, there is a school there and everybody, carpenters, plumbers, painters, used to go there in the morning and wait for somebody to come looking for help. I was there, too, every morning. Carpentry I couldn't take, painting I couldn't take, but I was there every morning seeing if somebody is looking for someone to help. One morning, a man comes over, he wants to take off, to clean the rubbish from new buildings. Nobody wanted the job. I said, "I'll take it." He asked me to show my hands. I showed him my hands and he looked at them and he said, "No, you wouldn't do." I said, "Wait a minute, how much do you pay?" He said, "A dollar and a half a day." I said, "Will I make ten cents?" He later admitted to me that he made me come because the way I put it to him, he saw I needed the ten cents and he was afraid to give it to me which he would gladly have given me to leave him alone. But he got scared and he told me to come. When I got there he explained, "You take a barrel, go up six flights of stairs, fill the barrel, bring it down, throw the rubbish on the street, and go up for the next barrel." There were no stairways. There were gangplanks in stead of stairways going up. I went up, filled the barrel, the foreman saw what I was doing and he started laughing and he was Russian, spoke nothing but Russian. I said, "What are you laughing about?" I could speak Russian. M. NASH: Where did you learn to speak Russian? L. NASH: I could speak Russian because in our city our main language was Polish, second language was Russian, and third language was German and I knew all the three languages well. I said, "What are you laughing about?" He said, "Go and pick it up." I couldn't even bend it. He said, "That is what I am laughing about. All you do is take two or three shovels at a time, not a barrel full." He helped me dump this barrel, put on about three shovels. In order not to spoil my clothes, I took off my shirt and my jacket and took a burlap bag, cut a hole, put it over my body, put the barrel on my back and down I went. As I was going down, I saw a hole on each floor in the wall. on the way up I looked in every hole. I didn't know what it was there for. It was open all the way down. I came up and I asked the foreman what it is. He didn't know. Lunch time the boss came and I asked him, "What are these hole down there." He said, "Oh, that's for the dumbwaiters." Well, I knew what a dumbwaiter was. I said, "When will the dumbwaiter come in?" "Oh," he said, "They don't come in until after the building is completely finished and cleaned and painted." I said, "Then why can't we use these holes to drop the garbage down?" I said, "If you throw this garbage through those holes you will be able to get men nd you will need one-tenth of the men than what you are needing now and you will do your job faster." He said, "That's very smart." He said, "It will go to the basement. Then you will have to carry it up." I said, "Can't we find a way of protecting that?" He said, "Let's see." The two of us went down and we came on the ground floor and I said, "Why can't we close it up here?" So instead of going to the basement it will fall down here. He said, "That's very smart." He said, "Don't carry anymore rubbish from the roof. Sit around and wait. I'm going to buy lumber and I'm going to get a carpenter, we are going to do the job just the way you said. Well, it wasn't exactly the way I said. It was better. Between him and the carpenter, they figured out a better way of doing it. It wasn't so easy, it was easy for me to say it, but when you have to make slant boards and you have to support them, it was quite a job, which I didn't know at the time, only developed when the carpenter came in. He went right out to look for the lumber and he came back about an hour later and said, "I can't get the lumber now." It will be delivered in the morning and I am going to get a carpenter to do it." In the morning, the lumber came, the carpenter came, the carpenter said he can't work alone, he needs another man. They had to go to get another man. Between him, myself and the carpenters, it took us until noontime to complete the job. At noontime the boss, the builder came. When he saw what we did, he raised a rumpus. He said, "You are going to spoil the building because it will damage the walls, it will damage down below." Well, it took some time between me and him to satisfy him to let us have the job. There had to be some changes made, which was done, and the first start of this was that we put one man on the sixth floor, we didn't need more than one man to throw garbage in the holes, two men would be one in each other's way, so I suggested that we put one man on the sixth floor and one man on the fifth floor and even one on the fourth floor so the garbage can come down fast and when it comes on the ground floor we would carry it out to the street. The first shovel of stuff that was thrown on the sixth floor, a brick hit the wall and fell out in the man on the fifth floor's eye. The man came running down with a swollen eye. I took him to the drugstore, I had sense enough to know that to go to the drugstore, the drugstore man said, "That's not my job, go to the doctor." He sent me to a doctor and the doctor fixed him up and the man made no complaint. He went back to work with an eye bandaged up. So that was alright. When the boss came in the evening I told him all about it, he took care of that. That night, he gave me three dollars and he said, "From now on, you stay down here and supervise the upstairs. You have nothing else to do but stay around here and watch it and I will give you twenty dollars a week." This was my first three dollars that I earned in four weeks. I decided now I am going to splurge. The entire three weeks I lived on a black radish for a penny a day for fear that my pennies that I was making Thursday and Friday would run out on me, so all I lived on was a black radish for three weeks for a penny. I said, "Now I am going to have a regular meal." I went to Delancey Street, had a seven course dinner for thirty-five cents. Then I said, "I'm going to sleep in a bed," because in the park, even though I was satisfied, the policeman wasn't and I had trouble getting woke up in the middle of the night going elsewhere. In the Bowery, I could get a bed for ten cents. I went to the Bowery. When I gave the man the ten cents he said, "Your straw hat is too nice. You better watch out, you are going to lose it." So I put the straw hat in my shirt, my jacket rolled up for a pillow, went upstairs, I got a canvass cot,laid down for the first time in three weeks, slept through the night, and in the morning I went to the bath house and got my bath, and went to my job. All that week, everything was fine, satisfactory. The man wanted me to stay with him, but during the week when I saw the way he looked and the builder who was the rich man looked filthy, dirty, I said, "I can't be a builder. My mother when she come here, she will die to see me in that kind of condition." I said, "I'm sorry, I'm not going to stay with you. I'll take the twenty dollars, I need it but I'm quitting." And sure enough, I went to the skirt factory and the man was very happy to see me. He said, "We got in work this week. In fact, I was going to look for you." So I was set, started working. But during the four weeks since I left my butcher shop, I didn't write home. My mother got scared and she decided that if I don't writs home there is something wrong and she wouldn't have it. My father must sell his business and come here, which my father agreed, and that business wasn't much to sell, but he sold out, ready to go. My mother said my father used to borrow money once a year from the bank. He had a good credit with them, and pay it off during the year, weekly. His credit was so good that he also guaranteed for my uncle, his brother. My mother wouldn't let him leave until he pays his debt and his brother's debt. He said, "She doesn't want to feel that in case his brother doesn't pay, that her family, she, did the bank out of it." So between paying my father's debts and paying his brother's debts, they didn't have enough money to come hear together. So my father and sister came here and my mother and brother were left home depending on my uncle to keep on paying the payments instead of the bank to her until we can send for her. When they got here I was already earning thirty dollars a week, my sister was handy enough to earn five, six dollars a week. My father didn't do so well, but he immediately asked, he wants mother here, if the family will be together we will manage with what we have. To please father, the woman I lived with was dealing with a customer peddler, buying stuff on installments. I said to the man, "I would like to get two steamship tickets for my mother." He said, "Steamship tickets we don't sell on installment." He said, "If I sell jewelry and you don't pay," he said, "I can take the jewelry back, but I can't take a steamship ticket back after she has gone." Well I said, "You are selling jewelry?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Then sell me the biggest watch and chain and I will take it to the pawnshop and I will get the money and pay you for the steamship tickets. He laughed. He said, "That is the craziest thing he ever heard of." He said he has sold jewelry to people who later found themselves in need of money. They went to the pawnshop, but never did anybody tell him that he wants to buy jewelry to pawn it. But the way I put it to him, he was kind of satisfied and he said, "I think you will pay." The next day he brought the watch and chain for a hundred and fifty dollars. I don't know exactly how to handle myself in the pawn shop. He said, "No, they wouldn't lend you any money, you are not of age. You have to get your father to go." My father wasn't too smart about that so we asked him to go with us. He did. There were two kinds of pawnshops, one that charged three percent a month and one charged one percent a month. I said I'll go to the one percent. And the one percent wouldn't give us more than fifty dollars. I took the fifty dollars, gave it to him, said, "Here, that is my first installment on the tickets. By the time we will arrange to get my mother to come, I will pay you the rest depending on my earnings and my sister's earnings," and we liver very economically, that I would be able to pay him off. Sure enough, my father got here I think in October. The watch and chain was to be paid three dollars a week. On the steamship ticket I think we owed another thirty dollars. I don't know exactly now, but I think it was thirty dollars. It took me just enough to be sure that we pay him off on the steamship ticket and we would send it home. Meanwhile my uncle stopped paying when he knew that the bank was paid off. He stopped paying. He didn't pay her anything. She was too proud to look for work at home. She did for a while, but then she went to her sister that lived about 150 miles away from Limburg, to live with her. We knew that, we sent her the tickets to where she is with her sister. We got enough money to send her to come her. She never told us that my uncle didn't pay, but we kind of suspected that if she left Limburg, that undoubtedly was because he wasn't paying. So we sent her money to come here. By that time I had established a good reputation with this customer peddler, that we were telling him that mother was coming. He gave us the tickets, we sent them home. When we told him that mother was coming, he himself bought a complete house outfit, furniture, utensils, even a garbage pail, completed, and he helped us find an apartment across the street from where we lived, on Norfolk Street, and he furnished the apartment complete,all on payments. My mother and brother came here in February. He was 11 years old. I wanted him to go to school, so in order to be able to go to school and earn some money for himself,we decided that he sell papers on the street. He went out one day, two days, he came home crying. he can't compete with the American boys. He can't speak, he can't sing, and he is not a fighter. He can't force his way like the others were running ahead one of the other in order to sell the paper. He couldn't do it so that was no good. But a friend of mine got him a job in a pipe factory, which just worked in for him to go to night school. So he worked in the pipe factory and went to the night school. Six months later, my boss who had a partner, and the partner decided he wants to leave, he wants to go back to home. M. NASH: What business was this? L.NASH: Skirt operating. He wants to get back home. So I propose to my partner I become his partner. He knew I could do all the work as good as he did, everything, so he had no objections to my becoming his partner, but his wife did. Her brother, who was an operator and was supposed to be a very--was a presser, and he was supposed to be a very high-class presser, was making big money, was willing to invest five thousand dollars for him to go into business. But my boss said no, he would rather take me without m money than his brother-in-law, who was so high-class, he said he wouldn't fit in and he wouldn't do the work the way he wants it. So in order to show good will, I had my gold watch and chain that I already paid off and taken out from the hock shop, back to the hock shop, fifty dollars, gave it to him as a partner. And I became a partner with him. I immediately decided we were doing contracting work for big manufacturers who were making suits and the skirts they gave up, that is what we were doing. I said, "Why not start making skirts and sell it ourselves? Make skirts and sell them," which he thought was a good idea. We went to Hester Street, we bought bundles of remnants. He was a good tailor, a good mechanic, he could make a garment out of little pieces, and we made skirts and I went out to sell them, but I couldn't sell much retail because I couldn't sell a man a half a dozen of one kind. It is one of a kind, but I did the best I could. We then decided that we better look for a store so we can sell them retail. retail, we can sell individual, single items. We found an empty store in the same building where I was carrying the rubbish down. The store had four rooms in the rear, so we had a store in the front big enough for our factory and he could live in the rear with his family. Our custom was that we started working Saturday night and we never quit until Friday. Friday I had to go home because my mother wanted the family together at home. Until Friday I never went home. But being that he lived in the back, so sometimes I went in and laid down and took a nap, he went back. Half the time, we never undressed. We slept bending down on the table. And that's how we lived and we were very happy and getting richer every day.It got so I said, "Well, we must start buying bigger pieces so I can make half a dozen of a kind to be able to sell it to storekeepers." When we started at that it looked like we were going to be able to go into business in a big way. So we decided to move west where manufacturers are who are dealing with retail trade. Here we couldn't expect to get a customer, and I could go out enough times to sell because I was still operating and I was still helping him. We decided to move west, which we did. Then he wife got all excited. I am ruining her life because we then also worked from Saturday night to Friday night and we didn't go home. So she started getting all excited, she went to complain to my mother and my mother said, "Look, it doesn't pay for you to break up a family. You like each other, you are very happy, everything is fine, but don't break up a family. Divide it, let him go, you go." He found that he had no alternative and he agreed that we divide up and he goes back to his family. This was three years later. Within these three years, he was drawing up enough money to buy cigarettes, so when we divided up all I got was seven hundred dollars, he got two machines and some other utensils. With seven hundred dollars, I didn't think I ought to start in business. I am no mechanic outside of being an operator and a good one, but I couldn't make a pattern. For that I would have to hire a designer. He agreed with me that it would be kind of risky with seven hundred dollars to go into business with an expense. He went to one of our countrymen who was just starting a business with twenty thousand dollars and he asked him to give me a ,job. When I was interviewed I asked for twenty dollars a week. They said, "No, for twenty dollars a week, we can get an experienced salesman, a man who has been in the business for years. Where do you come in asking for twenty dollars?" I got hurt and I said, "I'll tell you what I'll do. I only have seven hundred dollars and I'm not a mechanic. It is dangerous for me to go into business, but I am going in business now just because to spite you. In two years time, I will be as rich as you." And I said, "Not because I'll make as much money as you have not, but you will lose it." And so it was. My mother liked the idea, she wanted her son to be in business, and I started, my sister, my father, and myself, neither one of us mechanics, but I started in business. A year later I met one of these partners and I said, "Well, how are you doing?" He said, "I'm afraid you cursed us." He said, "I'm afraid I'm going to need you. We are losing money too fast." He sid, "Just as you told us, the salesman come in with fake orders. When we have the merchandise all ready to make delivery, they bring in a cancellation." He said, "we have to sell the good for half. We are in trouble all the time." I said, "That's exactly what I expected. I didn't wish you any hard luck, but from experience I had with meeting with different people, with different salesmen, when I was going out selling, and I knew how they handled the situations, I was afraid that this was what you were going to get into because from what I knew, from what my partners told me about you, the best you are were two good tailors and you don't know the least understanding of how to handle a business." And I said, "You could have used me very well." When we were buying remnants to make skirts, my partner found in one bundle a piece of goods that was 54 inches wide. He made a nice garment and it looked good. When I showed it to a retailer, he said they would buy a lot of it, but neither one of us knew where it came from, what kind of material it was. I decided I was going to find out so all week long I was busy, but on Saturdays I would go down town and follow every kind of a truck that was carrying piece goods, then get the name and address, go there, and nobody knew what it was until one day I found a truck coming from L.F. Domerick. I found that truck and went up looking through the different department and sure enough I found it in one of the department. I told them I wanted to buy a piece of good and I wanted to pay cash for it. He said, "We don't sell for cash. You have to go to the credit man and establish your credit and then we will sell it to you." When I went to the credit man and I explained who I was and what I was, and told him what I wanted to buy, he said, "What do you want to use that good for?" I said we found a way of making nice skirts with it. He said, "You fool you. This is used for undertakers. We cover coffins with that." A few months later I finally convinced him that I wanted goods and this was on a Saturday, he agreed to let me have a piece of goods, but told me definitely I must pay within ten days. He will trust me and I must pay within ten days. The piece of goods weighted almost as much as I did. I took it on my shoulder and brought it home, but I couldn't deliver it to my store because my partner was religious and so were my parents, and I left it with the grocery store for the evening and in the evening I brought it in the store. A couple of weeks later a woman came in to us on an evening and said, "My husband found a piece of imported goods. Can you make a good skirt. Let me see the goods." She unpacked the bundle and that was the same 54 inch goods that we found that was being used for coffins. So not realizing that if he agreed with her that was important goods, he could charge her a big price for making a skirt but being consciences he laughed. He said, "That's imported goods. Here, you see them, the skirts hanging up." She grabbed the piece of goods, rolled it up, and ran home, went out. About two or three weeks later she came back. She said, "What am I going to do with it? Make a skirt out of it anyway." He said, "I want five dollars." She said, "Five dollars I should give you for that rag?" I prospered slowly but steady and kept growing. I moved from Spring Street to Greene Street to a bigger loft,was doing well. I then moved to a bigger loft on 11th Street, doing well. I was on the 12th floor. I had two floors, the 11th and 12th floor. One day my credit was good, American Wollen Company was able to credit me with ten thousand dollars worth of goods which consisted of ten cases of jerseys. The goods came in one day, it was unpacked, put on the floor, and the next morning when we came, the goods were not there, nobody could figure out. I couldn't tell the police about it although I did call in the police and told them, but I begged them to please not publicize it because it because if my creditors would find out that I lost ten thousands dollars worth of goods, my credit would be cut and I would be out of business. They agreed. We did hunt quite a few places, but we never found the goods. Meanwhile I was pretty well stuck. I was short of ten thousand dollars although I had sixty days to pay it, but there was no chance of me getting in that different money so fast. I sent my father to my uncle who was a very nice man and he liked me very much too because his oldest son was my age and he couldn't make him do the things that he learned that I was doing, that I got into business and so on. My father told my uncle that I was doing very well, which was true, that I would need some help in order to turn over to pay my immediate bills. He gave him two thousand dollars cash. Just at that time, A.D. Juliard, who were big manufacturers of corduroy, came out with a new corduroy and asked sixty cents a yard. I, who had experience from Europe on piece goods, on yarns and weaving, said that these goods aren't worth any sixty cents a yard, and I said to my brother who was at that time already with me, "Go and find me somebody who manufacturers corduroy and I will try and see if I can duplicate those goods for less money." He was a good hunter and he found a manufacturer making corduroy for baby carriages and other use of that kind that used a lot of starch. When he brought me the samples, I said, "Well, that's not good for us, but if you make this without starch, this is what I need." I said, "Find out where the factory is." And the factory was in Massachusetts, Lynn, Massachusetts. I said, "I'm going to the factory and I'm going to show them how to make that without starch." I did, the man listened to me, he made up the first piece of goods without starch. It wasn't good enough so he made another piece of goods. It was just as good as Juliard's that was charging sixty cents a yard. My price was thirty cents. But, this was ten days credit on delivery. I gave him an order for ten cases of goods. When I told my brother about it, he fainted. He said, "Where are you going to get the money to pay for it?" I said, "I don't know, but I ordered it to pay in ten days." When the goods came, ten cases, a case of goods was about six foot by six foot square. Ten cases of that took half a block on 11th Street. When the man came and told them, "I have ten cases of good for you," he went down there and he sw it lined up on the street, he fainted. But while he was being picked up by people on the street, one fellow comes over and he says, "What have you got there?" He said, "What do you want, why are you bothering me now, I'm sick. How am I going to take care of that?" But one case was opened, so he saw it was corduroy, and he said, "Man alive, I'll buy the whole thing from you." I wasn't home then. I wasn't there at that time. Well, the goods were brought up. This man didn't let go. He went up with him, they opened up one piece of goods. He said, "I don't know. Wait for Louie to come home, he will tell you how much he wants." Now Juliard wanted sixty cents a yard less two percent, which meant fifty-eight cents. It cost me thirty. I asked him forty-five. He said, "I'll take it all." To cut a long story short, before the ten days were up I had all the money. This man bought almost all the goods. I meanwhile ordered another ten cases of goods and before about three months I made up the ten thousand dollars that was stolen from me on the piece goods there, and I was back in business, a successful merchant. M. NASH: Mr. Nash, could you tell me, your name was changed, wasn't it? L. NASH: Yes. My name was Noschkes. When I started in business people laughed at it. I never had a chance to tell anybody over the telephone without spelling it and even when I spelled it they laughed. They found it hard to copy. It got so that I made fun out of it when I gave my name to somebody. I would say, "My name is Nosch a kiss. That went over for a while, but in business I had a tough time explaining it. So I decided to change it, but while I was in business and I owed a lot of money, my lawyer used to say that it would be a hard thing to explain to notify the creditors. So I went along as it was. In 1920 when I was out of business I found that this was a chance for me to change the name and I changed it to Nash. M. NASH: Thank you very much, Mr. Nash.
