SIGRIST: Well, did somebody in your family come to America first? MILLER: OH, yeah. SIGRIST: Who came? MILLER: Well, first I had an aunt that, an uncle that came with his son, his daughter, his name was Rudah[ph], and he had a daughter that died here, he brought her. And then his wife followed him. So Irene's father went with them, and my father, also my father came here after they did, because they had, like, you know, acquaintance, they had somebody they knew here. And Irene's father came with Zint[ph], and so did Rudah[ph]. SIGRIST: What job did your father get when he came to America first? MILLER: Oh, he didn't have much of a job.

MILLER: Again, you know, that's so many years, I don't remember them. I had for her father and her mother, they also lived around there in the same towns, in the small town, Adorf[ph]. And, uh . . . SIGRIST: But you don't remember them. MILLER: No, no. They died before I was born. SIGRIST: Do you know, do you know what you thought about America before you got here? MILLER: Well, everybody raved, you know, in Europe. Oh, America, beautiful land, the best land really. And, uh, people that I knew had relatives here. They, uh, they said that it was very good, America's the best land. It was then the best land, too. You had to say God Bless America. SIGRIST: Do you remember what you packed when you left Lithuania? What did you take with you? MILLER: Well, I just took my clothes. I (?) and I didn't have much. And what else could I take? You know, I was young. SIGRIST: What about your mother? What did she pack? MILLER: She also had, she packed, you know, her clothes. When she came here, she got new clothes. SIGRIST: Did your mother bring any food with her? MILLER: No. The ship gave her enough food, good food. It was kosher, like parvae kosher foods, you know, it wasn't pure gravy. Like bacon and stuff like that, they never served that. SIGRIST: Do you remember where you got the ship? Where . . . MILLER: I just saw it (?) in, oh, at Marseilles. SIGRIST: Was it Vilna? MILLER: It wasn't a, it was a Russian, you know, Vilna, not Vilna. Vilna had an aunt living there. (?) SIGRIST: Well, maybe it will come to you as we go. Do you remember how you traveled from your town to wherever it was you got the ship? MILLER: We traveled, Europe had trains then, too. SIGRIST: You took a train. MILLER: A train, yeah. SIGRIST: Was that a long trip that you remember? MILLER: It was quite a while. I don't know why I can't remember the town, I went during the night. I remember that. You just, you just forget. I forget things now, too, a little bit. SIGRIST: Do you remember the ship for the first time? MILLER: Yeah. SIGRIST: What did that look like to you? MILLER: It was a really big ship, and they had, you know, they had, you had to rest, sit down on chairs, and stuff like that. I'm just trying to think, I knew (?). Like the ship, the name of the ship, the name of the ship I think was Bremen. Was there a Bremen? SIGRIST: Bremen? MILLER: Yeah. SIGRIST: Bremen, yes, there was, indeed. Sure. MILLER: Yeah, Bremen. On the Bremen. We came on the Bremen. SIGRIST: The Bremen was a big ship. MILLER: Yeah, very big, and very nice. SIGRIST: What else do you remember about being on the ship? What was the experience like for you? MILLER: Well, nothing that I could remember. Maybe how our meal was, you know? And sometimes they serve refreshments, like fruit and stuff, they'd go around and serve it to the people, the passengers. And then we'd have our meals. And we had lots of sleep. SIGRIST: Can you describe for me where you slept, what it looked like on the ship? MILLER: That's, uh, that's (?). And, I know I was resting good, that's all. I slept good there. SIGRIST: Do you remember what time of the year you were on the ship, what month that you left? MILLER: I don't know. When I came here, what does it say? In December? I thought I came, I don't know what month, but I know it was the tenth, the tenth then. SIGRIST: Because of Hanukah you remember that. MILLER: Hanukah yeah, yeah. And Hanukah's my birthday, so, in there. SIGRIST: Do you remember being seasick on the ship? MILLER: I was, horrible. Well, I used to go on my husband's year. SIGRIST: Much later. MILLER: Much later. And I, I, you know, I used to get sick. I don't remember where we went. SIGRIST: Do you know how long the ship was? MILLER: I don't know. No. SIGRIST: Did it, did it take a long time to get to America? MILLER: It took, I don't know, about a year I think. No? SIGRIST: No, when you were on the ship. MILLER: Yeah? SIGRIST: How long it took to get across the Atlantic Ocean? MILLER: It took about a year I think, no? SIGRIST: It would be less than that. MILLER: Less than that. SIGRIST: Yeah. MILLER: Maybe. SIGRIST: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty when you came into New York Harbor? MILLER: Yeah. And then, as I say, then we came to, what do you call it, to, I told you about that man walking around saying . . . SIGRIST: You had to go to Ellis Island. MILLER: Ellis Island, yeah. SIGRIST: Tell me about the man again. Tell me, what was the man saying? MILLER: I don't know his name. SIGRIST: No, but what was he saying to you? MILLER: Oh, he was saying, "Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down." You know, to all the people, sit down meaning where you should sit, you know? And I didn't know what that meant at that time. I didn't know what sit down means. And I sit down anyway. And then my father was there, and my aunt, I had an aunt that was there before, before us. In fact, that aunt, Irene's father came to America with her when she came. She came around maybe, maybe a year before us. SIGRIST: Do you remember anything else about Ellis Island? Do you remember being examined by a doctor? MILLER: Yeah. SIGRIST: What did they do? MILLER: They examined you like a doctor does, you know? He examined your eyes. Your eyes, especially. That was very important. You had to have good eyes to come in this country. If your eyes weren't good, like I had bad eyes for a while, the cone, the cone, they called it. So I went to, uh, where did I go? I went to some town near Conway, not in Conway. But we were there, both of us. I went to a doctor, he cured my eyes, that I was able to come. SIGRIST: Yeah. So the doctor cured you, so you were able to get through at Ellis Island. MILLER: At Ellis Island, yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember eating at Ellis Island? MILLER: I think so. I don't remember what we ate, but we had to eat, we were there a whole day. We came in during the night. Then the next morning they all came to take us home, wherever, an apartment or something. SIGRIST: Do you remember, do you remember where that apartment was that . . . MILLER: Rutger Street. SIGRIST: What was the street? MILLER: Rutger's, in New York, downtown. Do you know where that is? SIGRIST: CAn you describe the apartment, what it looked like? MILLER: I told you, it had a bedroom, it had, it had a kitchen, and it had a stove. They used to use wood for the stove, to make the stove. My mother, she's religious, so she, a woman used to come in on Saturday to start the stove. One time my brother, he was (?), Irene's father, he got dressed up like a woman, and he came in to make the stove. My mother looked at him, and looked at him. Ay, Machel[ph], Machel[ph]. She recognized him. That was, you know. He's a funny, I always found him very funny. And they got jobs, too, someplace, when they came here. They got jobs. A movie . . . SIGRIST: Now, did you stay with your aunt in her apartment for a while? When you first got here . . . MILLER: Yeah, we stayed, yeah. SIGRIST: You stayed with your aunt. MILLER: And then we moved to Roselle. SIGRIST: And did you move with your father to Roselle? MILLER: No, I, my mother was already, when I was with my father, my mother was here already, too, with me. I came with my mother. SIGRIST: Right, right. MILLER: My father came alone. He wasn't here but for maybe a year, or maybe longer without us, and then he made enough money and sent us money to come, you know, to pay for the ticket to come here. But, uh . . . SIGRIST: Did your mother work when she got to America? MILLER: Nah, uh-uh. SIGRIST: No? MILLER: Mother didn't work, no. SIGRIST: Now, did your father continue selling the potatoes? MILLER: Yes. When we came to Roselle, he had a butcher store. He here, he got into a butcher store, and he made a very nice living for us. Some of the worst, I don't know which ones didn't work with help of, you know. SIGRIST: Can you tell me how you learned English? MILLER: When I went to school. SIGRIST: What was it like to go to school in America? MILLER: It was nice, it was nice, but I had to learn the language. SIGRIST: Was that hard? MILLER: Well, it was hard when you know what it's all about. Yeah. SIGRIST: Can you, can you tell me a little bit about what it was like to go to school when you got to America? MILLER: You know something? I must tell you something. There's a man here, well, he's, uh, he was sick. Frank Halluck[ph]. He went to, he lived in Roselle also, and we both went to school together, to kindergarten. And now he's here, he lives here. A very nice man. SIGRIST: So when you got to America, so they put you into kindergarten. MILLER: Yeah. SIGRIST: But you were older than that. MILLER: No, well, I wasn't much older. He was ninety-four. SIGRIST: No, no. I mean, when you got to America, they put you into kindergarten? MILLER: Yeah. SEe, that's why I thought I was seven years old or eight years old. But the reason, the reason my grand, daughter-in-law, her husband passed away, and she, she says that by certain mails back there, that she thinks that I was ten years old. But I don't know exactly, you know? So, uh . . . SIGRIST: Did your mother like being in America? MILLER: Yeah, she liked it. SIGRIST: Was there something very difficult for her to adjust to there? MILLER: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: Why? MILLER: It was. Well, she was very, very religious, very religious. She, she fasted all, all, all, in the holidays that just you're supposed to fast, everything. There was several holidays over the Jewish, you know, year that they, they have to fast, like certain holidays like that, she did. She fasted them all, all she did. And she was very religious. She wanted the children to be like her, but the children weren't so religious, you know. SIGRIST: Do you think that people were more religious in Europe than they were here in America? MILLER: Well, it depends who they were. My mother was just as religious here, very religious. SIGRIST: When you lived in Europe, did you ever experience any antisemitism? When you lived in Lithuania, did you ever experience a pogrom, or your parents talking about experiencing a pogrom? MILLER: They used to come in, sure. That I remember. Uh, up on the stoves, I was on top of the stove, I was resting, and all the Russian people came rushing, you know? They came in, sometimes they would take things, you know? Like that they didn't like. But they come in, what are you going to do? They'd come. They're coming from a different city. And it was bad, it was bad. That was bad. SIGRIST: And this would happen from time to time, correct? MILLER: From time to time, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I remember all the time I was sleeping on the stove, on top of the stove, and some, some of them came in, some men. Not the women, but the men came in. A pogrom, a pogrom, you know, they called it. SIGRIST: Did you ever see anyone get killed or hurt during a pogrom? MILLER: Well, I wasn't near at that time, but they did. They got, a lot of them, they were families with the children, and then they, some of the girls were there, they ruined the girls, you know? They were very mean. SIGRIST: Well, we'll get you back to America. MILLER: Yeah. SIGRIST: When you were in America, what was, what was your favorite part about America? What did you like the most about being here? MILLER: Well, I, see, we lived in Roselle, I told you. Going to school is nice in there. SIGRIST: Were there lots of immigrants that lived in Roselle? MILLER: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: Were they mostly Jewish? MILLER: Yeah, Jewish people, but I knew, I knew, uh, some friends my father knew from Europe, I didn't know them, but he did. And, uh, when we came, they took us in. And then we got a house to live in. And it was nice. I liked it. SIGRIST: Did your parents learn how to speak English? MILLER: They spoke, my father. My mother didn't speak much English, but my father did. Broken English but he, you know, he spoke English a little bit. And he used to, as I say, he used to go to, he was a butcher. He used to go to Roselle. There was a train coming there, and he'd get meats, you know, sides of cows and cut it up and sell it, and then in Europe, too, he used to get eggs and sell them. I mean, you know, that was his business. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO SIGRIST: Did your parents ever want to go back? MILLER: No, never. SIGRIST: To Europe? MILLER: Never. They liked it. They liked this country. My mother did, too. And my father, they say he was a free man, you know, he liked to go here and liked to go there, and he enjoyed being in America. SIGRIST: Are there certain things that your parents taught you, certain values that your parents tried to instill in you when you were growing up, things to live by? MILLER: They didn't. If they did, I forgot. I forget some things here, sure, over the years. If I came here ten years, even ten years, it's already how many years? SIGRIST: It's a long time. MILLER: A long time. SIGRIST: A long time. MILLER: To remember. I'm glad I remember what I do, you know? Even now, uh, I remember, uh, as I told you, the telephone is wonderful. I would pick up the telephone, and I'd call a neighbor of mine that I had, not Jewish. I had a couple of Gentile people that lived near me here, and I lived in, uh, Edison, Edison, New Jersey. I lived in Edison, New Jersey. I had an apartment. You see, some of our home, we built it. SIGRIST: When did you get married? MILLER: When the war stopped, the first war. SIGRIST: The First World War? MILLER: Yeah, the First World War. Because the children were in the Second World War, but my husband was in the First. SIGRIST: What was your husband's name? MILLER: Abe, Abe Miller. Abraham Miller. SIGRIST: And was he born in Europe, too? MILLER: He was born in Rahway. SIGRIST: He was born in Rahway. MILLER: Yeah. SIGRIST: Was he older than you, or younger? MILLER: Ah, I think I, they tell me I was a little older. So, but he's a very nice man. You know, he was with a company during the war, and they have a metal business. They did so well. I only had a mink coat, a long mink coat, and a mink jacket and a mink stole. That's all I had. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Enough to keep you warm. MILLER: It kept me warm. SIGRIST: Do you still speak any Yiddish? MILLER: Yeah, I do, sure. SIGRIST: Could you say, maybe a prayer or something for us in Yiddish on tape? Is there something you remember? Could you just say a few lines of something? MILLER: I remember it. I used to say ( she speaks in Yiddish ). SIGRIST: And what does that mean? MILLER: ( Yiddish ) When you light candles. Are you Jewish? You're not even Jewish. SIGRIST: No. MILLER: No wonder! ( she laughs ) No wonder. No, that's, I used to, now I gave my candlesticks to my granddaughter, and she lights them. And here we have our shabbat, like tomorrow, yeah, in this, in the home. And, uh, they, they have a man that sings. The men, the men, the women, oh, they had a good time. And, uh, he says a prayer for wine, a prayer if you had (?), and then he says a prayer for the challah, and (?) the challah, and eats a piece of challah, and has, they drink wine, they have wine. Otherwise I have some soda, you know? I thought you were Jewish. SIGRIST: No. ( he laughs ) Mrs. Miller, I want to thank you very much. You've been, you've been wonderful. You answered all my questions. MILLER: Well, I don't know what I could do, you know? As I say, it's very hard, because I was married in, I think, 19, when was the war over? SIGRIST: 1918. MILLER: 1918. SIGRIST: The First World War ended. MILLER: We were married 1918, 1919, so it's a long time, too. SIGRIST: It's a long time. Anyway, this is . . .
