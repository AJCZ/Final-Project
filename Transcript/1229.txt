DIXON: Today is September 26, 1980. My name is Harvey Dixon and I'm speaking with Joseph Novel on Liberty Island. Mr Novel first is going to tell us about Ellis Island when he was there. He first came in 1931. Mr. Novel, how did you come to be on Ellis Island in 1931? NOVEL: I was locked up by the immigration authorities for deportation. DIXON: How did you get into the United States? NOVEL: I jumped ship in 1929 in Philadelphia. DIXON: And so the immigration people picked you up. Did they pick you up in New York City or Philadelphia? NOVEL: Brooklyn, near five Bush Garden. DIXON: How did they find out that you were in the country illegally? Do you know? NOVEL: Well, there was many aliens picked up. They were picked up left and right from Brooklyn piers and the waterfront all the time. They picked me up on 42nd Street--that's where they found me--two blocks away from the pier. DIXON: So they kind of swept the whole area, and they simply got you among them. NOVEL: One by one, they'd get them all. DIXON: Right. So what happened after they picked you up? NOVEL: I was in Ellis Island to be deported, to put on a ship to go back to Europe. I give them a story that I got money coming on 42nd Street, between 5th and 6th Avenue in Manhattan. It was not true, but I give them a story just to get out. When we got on 42nd Street, the guard had this chain like a dog's chain with a handle out on my face. I pulled him down the subway steps head first and we broke off. I went one way and he went the other way. DIXON: You got away? NOVEL: I got away. DIXON: So you didn't go to Ellis Island at all? NOVEL: No, I escaped from there. DIXON: Oh, I see. You escaped from Ellis Island. NOVEL: From the guard on 42nd Street. I was supposed to face my problems. DIXON: So in other words, you went to Ellis. How long were you on Ellis Island? NOVEL: It was long time, anyway. The only thing I remember was a big zeppelin circling all the village. It must have been 4th of July on 1931. About six hundred or seven hundred ships, all of them flying all over New York, and all different shapes. They weren't plain like today, all different types at that time. DIXON: Ah, so the dirigibles were still in service. NOVEL: Yes, yes. It must have been a 4th of July celebration or something like that for 1931. DIXON: Right. But you were on Ellis a long time. NOVEL: Long time, yes. DIXON: So then they took you to 42nd Street and you got away. NOVEL: I escaped in New York. I broke away from the guard, yes. DIXON: So what happened after you broke away? NOVEL: Well, I went back to work on the waterfront. The waterfront was, I would say, in 1930 was a slave camp. Hard work especially for the majority of the Italian. I'm not Italian, but I'm telling you because eighty per cent of the people that work on the waterfront was Italian and about sixty per cent aliens. When a man used to get hit in the leg and he was sent to the company case, or something like that, they just called up the immigration, the company, have them pull him back to Italy, and that's how they used to pay them off. It cost nothing. It happened to me in 1938. I got hit on the foot and I lost my toenail, which then was up by the Armory. They told me if I make a complaint for money, that they would ship me back so I would keep quite and keep working. DIXON: Right. It's kind of like the Mexicans nowadays. you were here illegally and they knew it. So they could get you to be quite. NOVEL: That's right. That's right. These years on the waterfront, thank God for a fellow by the name of Austin Franklin, the Jewish fellow I lived with. He saved me many times from deportation, not only myself but others. He was such a good I would picture him as a . He was such a good-hearted and he passed away. He always used to take care of all the Italians. Actually, for Italians at hat time, you wouldn't need policemen on the street; they was all honest people. And it broke their heart. It was hard for them. Some would commit suicide before going back to the Old country. They really love America. It's not like the immigrant that came here he don't know what's what. He knew what he wants. He loved it. He worked two jobs. And when he sees a policeman on the street, by bypassed and crossed the street because he was afraid that the cop might arrest him or something like that. DIXON: Right. The gentleman's name was Austin Franklin? NOVEL: Austin Franklin, yes. I lived with him for ten years and I didn't pay no rent. DIXON: That was nice. And what nationality are you? You're not Italian. NOVEL: I'm Yugoslavian. DIXON: Yugoslavian. NOVEL: I talk it, I guess. DIXON: How many times had you been to the United States before you jumped ship in 1931? NOVEL: Well, in 1929 I jumped the ship. Oh, yes. I navigated quite a bit, quite a few times, yes. DIXON: So you had been over here before. NOVEL: This last time that I jumped was a Slavic ship, but the captain's Slavic name like Nikolish. The first mate was Nikolish, and the commander was Nikolish. So when Italy took over, the ship commander, he changed him name. He called himself Nicolini. So I called one morning in Slavic, "Good morning, Mr. Nikolish." He said the first port we come to in Europe, he will come and throw me off the ship, he says to me. So I jumped ship in Philadelphia a couple days after. DIXON: So Italy took over Yugoslavia and changed the ships... NOVEL: This port was occupied like. DIXON: Okay, once you escaped, what happened? Did you just go back to doing what you did before? NOVEL: I worked as a longshoreman. And even during the war...when the war broke out with the Japanese and Pearl Harbor, I went to volunteer. I think it was 91st Street were everybody volunteered. They took my name and everything else. The guy wanted my birth certificate--he wanted to know where I come from. I told him I was born in Austria, "and fine. I lost my father in World War I fighting with the German." He says to me, "I can't take you." So the next guy to him, "You go and help those ." (Laughter) I put on my hat and I walked out. I was loading ammunition at Pier Five Bush, Brooklyn. This time I was no longer an alien. I was an enemy alien, now. (Laughter) So the fellow, the agent, come down at gunpoint. I says, "No use! Please don't come down because with copper nails because you have explosives. If you make a spark with metal or something, we're all going to wind up in Staten Island from here!" So he took me to Ellis Island, and there I was also questioned. they thought I was a spy or something. All through that procedure. Also got a beating because I answered nasty when I went through. Then I end up with the Italians and Germans on Ellis Island. DIXON: You went up with? NOVEL: The Italians and German people that was aliens, enemy aliens and POWs from the ships. It was all mixed up there. So I was against them. I was the only guy in the room against them. So they used to beat me up because I was alone. But when I used to catch him by himself--a guy by the name of Ezio Pinza. Have you heard of Ezio Pinza, the singer? DIXON: Right. NOVEL: His wife put him there. I went to work on him one day. I got him the toilet. (Laughter) DIXON: Enzio Pinza, why was he... NOVEL: He was also an alien. He was Italian. And his wife put him in there. DIXON: And he was supportive of the Italians in Europe, is that why? NOVEL: Yes, he was a fascist, whatever you call them for the party. This was going on for a long time here. And I remember when Normandy went down there in 1942, you could see it from the backside of the room. Not the room that you show the people now, but the one behind with the bars. I don't know if your familiar with Ellis Island-- the one with the bars. DIXON: So you could see the Normandie sailing by? NOVEL: You could see the ship. When it went over, you'd think it was Yankee Stadium with Babe Ruth hit ten home runs. Everybody clapped except me. You know, I was the only one that was sad. DIXON: So the Normandy was sinking? NOVEL: Yes. The Normandy tipped over. Remember the...? DIXON: No, I don't know. Tell us about it. NOVEL: It tipped over. There was a fire and it tipped over and it went down. They all clapped with happiness. They thought the Germans sabotaged. DIXON: Right. This was in Manhattan? NOVEL: This was in Manhattan. You could see it from Ellis Island very well. Then I got called to the there was no further immigration. The FBI was in charge. So they called me up and they told me I am a troublemaker because all this fighting. They going to send me to Springfield, Colorado. I don't want to go. So I told them, I says to him, "I'm no troublemaker. I'm on your side." I started walking around the room. He said, "Come back here soldier," to me. He says, "Put your hand up." I had to swear in, papers like that and sign everything to go in the U.S. Army. I said, " Yes, of course." So he gave me a paper to go to the draft board and from there I went up to Fort Belva, Virginia. In fort Belva, Virginia, I was pulling guard on many buildings in Washington. When your name come in a bowl. And also outside the gate of the White House twice. And I was not even an American citizen. DIXON: So when you got to Ellis Island the second time, they put you in the Army? NOVEL: No, I volunteered. DIXON: You volunteered. NOVEL: I volunteered in the Army, yes. DIXON: But you didn't want to go to Colorado, so that why... NOVEL: No, no. Well, I had fights with the Germans and they called me a troublemaker, you know? DIXON: So, okay, what happened after you enlisted? You went to the White House gates and were a guard. What was the other thing? NOVEL: All those buildings in Washington, D.C., the important buildings. From Fort Belva, there's only five or six miles. I used to pull guard. If you pull KP or wherever you go, and when they go to Washington, you got to go to Washington. DIXON: Right. You stayed the whole war there? NOVEL: No, no, no, no. Then I guess, I made the Normandy. I made Normandy. My platoon name was actually on the boat in Normandy. We took ammunition and brought them to the beach, twenty five tons more than any other platoon. I had all the kids from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Pollacks and Italians. I picked the hard workers from the mines. We throw ammunition down like it was butter. DIXON: Right. So you unloaded at Normandy? I noticed in the scrapbook you sent that you got a Bronze Star. NOVEL: Yes, yes. That's when I went to Belgium. We went to Antwerp. I was assigned a full battalion. I could have come home. I had a lot of points, but I wanted to see my relatives in Old Country. So I stood there. One day in a bar in Antwerp, I meet two friends of mine. I didn't want to go see the show. It was "The Plainsmen," and old American picture, Gary Copper. It was showing for the first time. "Let's go to the show." So I paid for the tickets. We went to the show and there wasn't a front seat. In the front row was two seats and there was three of us. One of the guys says to me, "Get out of here. That's my seat!" So the two of them sit over there and I went in the back to sit in the balcony. I wasn't there no five minutes, then a direct hit with a V2 rocket bomb. Hits the show. Was over nine hundred dead. Was only three remaining alive; myself and two little girls. I don't know. I cant explain this. Over nine hundred men to die over you!. The blood from the people, it looked like you swimming in it. You never think of pieces of body flying like chicken feed before they die. So these two little girls, there must have been an apartment on top because it was a big, old fashioned tub. Those two kids might be four or six, but they must have been taking bath in the top and somehow or another that top saved their lives. DIXON: Oh, a bathtub! NOVEL: Yes. (laughter) I don't know how. Anyways, the remaining dead, they must have went up in the air like a balloon and come down. And I passed them on the street. that's the only way you can get out was to. And then I had to climb myself down on a piece of hanging . But I cannot explain that nine hundred people had to die in one particular spot at once. DIXON: You were a very lucky fellow. NOVEL: Yes. I was all black and blue from head to toe from the concussion. DIXON: Right. And you also mentioned in your scrapbook that you one time went across into the East, the Communist countries. NOVEL: Yes, but I was in Germany in 1945. There was no furlough for Communist states. DIXON: There was no what? NOVEL: They were giving no furloughs, the American army to the Communist zone because of the trouble, especially... DIXON: This was when the war was over? NOVEL: The war was over in 1945. So I asked for a Compassion Furlough to Gorlitz, which was near Trieste. It would have been the 85th Division, U.S. Army main headquarters from Germany. So I go there and I met a farmer with his horse and wagon all fresh. I gave my stuff to take it across the border to my house in so and so place. So at night I passed through the hills where I was born. I passed the American Guard, the British Guard and the Communist guard. (Laughter) I was wishing actually, that the Communist guard would catch me. This way they would take me to the headquarter, which about a mile from my old house. The next morning was Sunday. So my mother said, "Let's go to church." I dresses up in an American uniform. Nobody know. All we crossed though was Communist guard. They all salute me, I salute back. And when I went to church I felt four bayonets on my back. "Come on inside the Headquarters." They anted to know what I was doing here. I said, "What am I doing here! What are you doing here? I was born here. Where are you from? One guy was from Milan, Italy. Another guy was form something Yugoslavia. They couldn't understand one another. One would kind of talk Italian. The other guy talked Slavish. He was the guy in charge. DIXON: These were occupying your country? NOVEL: These were the partisans or Communist, whatever you call them. So I told them, he says, "All right for a pack of cigarettes?" The other guy says, "All right for two packs of cigarettes. I stood there as long as I want." (Laughter) It was fine. DIXON: And you had no trouble getting back? NOVEL: No, no trouble getting back to the Americans. But by going through, they won't let you through. You know what I mean? Actually, an American captain told me, he saw me one day coming from the Yugoslavian territory. He says, "What are you doing there?" I says, "I was home. I was born there." He says, "If you give $1000 . DIXON: So you went back and forth a lot of times. NOVEL: For three years, which is like from New York to Staten Island. This border is between, Yes. Then you got the waterfront. DIXON: Right, the waterfront story. Tell us the waterfront story. NOVEL: Well, the waterfront story. I used the stuff in the engineer many times, primer cord. I told people and I told the guards before this happened that this stuff could blow us to . it looks like a rope, a telephone wire. Nobody think, you know. So there were storing it all over, which should be stored only on back so you could throw it overboard. DIXON: This is in reference to an explosion at a dock in Brooklyn. NOVEL: Yes, that's right. DIXON: Primer cord. NOVEL: Nobody believe. So finally in 1956, December 3, the pier went in fire. I live near there. From 25th Street to 41st Street was a couple of walking blocks. I went down to look for myself. The thing went off and blow up. Twenty-two die and some die after, but three thousand die. The explosion was so great that you see the firemen from the roof, they fly off like cardboard boxes, the pressure. But my family, when the shock was over, they was all right. This guy, the underwriter, says that it was lucky that he area that exploded was in the pier. The cement give, the pressure went up and down. It was the Third Avenue or Fourth Avenue where the bottom would be solid, for fifteen square blocks it would be all dead even if it hit you or not because it lost ninety percent of its power. DIXON: I see. That was because it was concrete? NOVEL: Because it was just a pier giving. The pressure went up and down on the water, you know? It was only ten percent of its power. If it was on a street, it would have given one-hundred percent of its power. Even if it don't hit you, it would have teared you apart. DIXON: And this was the Luckenbach Dock? NOVEL: Luckenbach Pier. DIXON: Luckenbach Pier. What was the year? 1956 did you say? NOVEL: 1956, December 3. DIXON: Okay, well, that's very interesting. You had a very busy life. (Laughter) When you were on Ellis Island, the second time and the enemy aliens were there, were there any well known enemy aliens there? Enzio Pinza was there, you mentioned. NOVEL: Enzio Pinza was one of them. I remember Enzio Pinza, I fought him twice. I knocked the hell out of him twice. (Laughter) DIXON: You didn't get along well, eh? NOVEL: No, because I don't agree with them I was the only one. DIXON: And they put you amongst all those people that you didn't agree with? NOVEL: That's right. Well, they took me out of Pier Five because I was loading ammunition. They thought maybe I'd try to blow up a ship or something. And the boss on Pier Five wanted to fight the Secret Service men. He says, "They're taking my best man away from me!" He didn't want that. DIXON: How were you treated on Ellis Island? NOVEL: Oh, lovely, Ellis Island. But Ellis Island, now, for example, this boat that you have there, the old ferry boat. DIXON: It sunk. NOVEL: This was just, what do you call them? It was a nest for water rats. DIXON: Right. It's a pity it sunk. NOVEL: Wouldn't it look nice if you get some of these countries like France or England or somebody. I'm sure they would donate to Ellis Island two old 1700, well, 1800 sailboats that people could visit. Would attract more people. You could see beauty where the immigrants used to come in. We had no water. I had to call it, it was like a s;ave ship, those things. It took you, and if he wasn't sick coming from Europe, he got sick on the ship before he arrived in the United States. It was like sardines. I think that would beautify the entry of Ellis Island, and I'm sure the countries would give you for nothing those ships. You know what I'm talking about? DIXON: They're working on plans for Ellis right now. NOVEL: But I think that would beautify the entrance to see those beautiful ships from 1700, 1800. I'm not talking the battleships, the bullships. You see how many we have here in '76? Two of them belong on Ellis Island. I'm sure England, France or Netherlands, they have many. DIXON: That's an interesting idea because that's the way people came over. Have some of the ships at Ellis. NOVEL: Yes. We don't want to see the battleships. The battleships just took ten days, twelve days from Europe. The others took--it took me 62 days from Trieste to go to Buenos Aires. I was on the behind the canalboat. Nobody wanted that job. I took it in 1927. I was fourteen years old then. (Laughter) DIXON: But hey treated you well? They treated all the aliens... NOVEL: All wonderful. Nighttimes, the food all you wanted. The only thing I had trouble, because I was suspected to be a spy. I got beaten. Then I got beaten by the Germans. DIXON: They beat you because they thought you were a spy? NOVEL: Well, they asked questions. They work you over. I don't know nothing. I told them I made a mistake because I tried to enlist. They got my name there. That must have been a follow through. DIXON: And you ended up in the Army anyhow. NOVEL: Then they find out that I escaped from Ellis Island. This guy was a big wheel. The war was on, you know what I mean? DIXON: How long, actually, were you on Ellis Island this time? Six months or a month or three months? NOVEL: I was long time both times. That's what I would like to know right now. They got the records. i also would like to know the day that I escaped from Ellis Island because in '81 it's going to be 50 Years! I'd like to have a party on that day. DIXON: After you escaped, they didn't recapture or they didn't try? NOVEL: Oh, they tried. DIXON: But they never did succeed. NOVEL: Never succeeded, that's right, yes. After I visit this Jewish guy, Franklin, they got to me. He had connections with all kinds of authorities and I was not protected for until I got into the Service. DIXON: Well, I guess a reasonable: You weren't a citizen. Are you a citizen now? NOVEL: Oh, yes. I became a citizen about, actually a year after I was in the army. I got discharged here. Do you want to see it? DIXON: Sure. NOVEL: You don't want this. That's from the fire department. Here's the discharge and the entry to the Army. Yes, 1943 was when I got the papers. DIXON: So you are a citizen now of the United States. NOVEL: Oh, yes. A year after I served. I could have got out of the army. Nobody would question it. I could have gotten discharged. DIXON: So in other words, you became a citizen because you wanted to. NOVEL: That's right. DIXON: How old are you now? You started... NOVEL: On the sea, I was fourteen years old when I left home. DIXON: You were fourteen when you left. And how old are you now. NOVEL: I'll be sixty-eight in November. DIXON: So in 1931, how old were you? NOVEL: Oh, nineteen. DIXON: So you were very young when they first... NOVEL: Yes. I could pick two hundred pounds now. At hat time I picked a guy, (Laughter) I can't run that fast, but I could stand it through what they've got. You don't want this thing. That's from the commander on the, what do you call it? DIXON: Commander when you were on the... NOVEL: You know something else? That award I got was awarded to me on the General Eisenhower in 1944. DIXON: This is the Bronze Star. NOVEL: If you look at the Bronze Star, it took thirteen years to hike to Brooklyn. It was issued to me in 1957. So otherwise, I got the Bronze Star on the General Eisenhower was... DIXON: President? NOVEL: Awarded it. And it was issued to me on the General Eisenhower when he was the President. DIXON: So there was a long, how many years between the two? NOVEL: You got to date it. Look on it. It took 13 years. DIXON: Thirteen? NOVEL: Yes. DIXON: That's a long time for them to issue it. 1957 it was issued. Oh, I see. It was awarded in 1944 and... NOVEL: I received it in... DIXON: In 1957. Thirteen years, that's a long time. Novel: You'd never think you got it on the general and then it became a president thirteen years after. DIXON: That's very interesting. Too in your scrapbook you mentioned that you'd written something about the Grand Union Flag. What was the story about the Grand Union Flag? NOVEL: Yes, I just thought of this in my estimation. I know you don't remember the school, if they're still allowed to teach--especially in Eastern Europe--American Revolution was number one subject. I know about American flag, but I can't see why they don't have a lot of respect for the thing of '76. I was at Fort Aminton, Brooklyn. In '76 they was flying and the command force were flying the Grand Union Flag. I make believe I don't know nothing. I asked the commander there, who was a colonel, I was says, "What kind of flag is that?" He says to me, he don't know the one. He says, "Nobody know the first American flag" He says, "Washington would die from this!" Well, the guys did die. How can you tell them that that other flag was their flag which came after. DIXON: So this Grand Union Flag is actually a later flag than the right flag. NOVEL: The Great Union Flag is the 1776 American flag. The only flag that flew. The other ones came or didn't come, especially the men don't fly the '76 one. First of all, that one has six reds and five white stripes. It's the opposite. In 1776, well, the Commies was British. They were backing up the British ship. It came after. DIXON: So the Grand Union Flag they were flying was wrong to fly then because... NOVEL: That's right. It was right to fly that. Many nations fly it in '76, even the tall ships. But England the supplies because in 1876, they did do that. The Declaration of Independence was signed under that flag. We had no other flag. Many people died in 1776, 1777. DIXON: I think probably a lot of people are not aware of that part. NOVEL: What? DIXON: That's good that you knew that. A lot of people... NOVEL: Well, you see, thing is what I'm talking is what you studied. There's proof, there's proof in different country from the Smithsonian Institute for Washington himself. DIXON: That's interesting. NOVEL: You know I got nothing else to do after I retire, so I like to pick up very different things. DIXON: Well, let's see. Where did--did you meet your wife in New York? Your wife? NOVEL: Yes, after the World War II. DIXON: You have children? NOVEL: No, I have no children. DIXON: You are glad you came to the United States? NOVEL: Of course I'm glad! (Laughter) If I wasn't glad, I wouldn't go to war with them. DIXON: That's true. NOVEL: On the waterfront after the World War II, it was a happy going. Before the war, it was slave camp, war camp. You work in all kind of condition and different things. But after the World War II, even today, you can't get a better job than a longshoreman. I got a P wage and most of the people are on P wage. DIXON: So you were a longshoreman after you got out of the military? NOVEL: All the time, before and after. DIXON: You're retired now. NOVEL: Yes. DIXON: When you were on Ellis Island in 1931, was it a busy place or were there many people? NOVEL: Oh, very busy. Almost all deportation, those places behind there--what you show them on Ellis Island--is the immigrant that came with the windows open. You got to see the wall of the Island there. I don't know if your familiar with it. You got to make a story about that, too. Most people didn't want to back. DIXON: So they deported a lot of people in the '30s who came over illegally, like you. NOVEL: Oh, yes. DIXON: They just swept the area. NOVEL: They used to have next to us a special boat that used to take them to the ships, passenger liner. Put them right on the ship and, deportment. DIXON: Lot of them were seamen who jumped ship, like yourself? NOVEL: That's right. The majority, especially the majority was in the thirties, they was picked up just because, sometimes, they had Italian name. They was picked up, like Sacco and Vanzetti, I don't know was guilt or not, but you know what I mean? In those days, when you look and it was an Italian name, it was like... END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO DIXON: You were saying that you didn't find it a hard time in the 30s because you, what were you doing in the 30s? NOVEL: Well, I work on the waterfront. My second job I used to ship from . I work over there for smaller wages, and on weekends--Saturday or Sunday. I could always get jobs washing dishes. So was good for that time, twenty dollars, eighteen, twenty dollars a week was good money. You only used to pay but ten dollars a month rent. DIXON: But what I was thinking of was they wanted to get people like you back to Yugoslavia so someone who was supposed to be here could get the money. That's probably what they were thinking. NOVEL: Oh, you mean when I got arrested? DIXON: Right. When you had the job, they wanted to give it because there was a lot of people looking for jobs. NOVEL: Oh, the people there, they used to squeal on one another. People used to turn them in because the guy worked because he was an alien and the other guy then worked. Maybe the other guy don't want to do the hard work. Anyway, I used to go to all the hard work experience. DIXON: Was there ever a reward for turning somebody in, like a bounty? NOVEL: There wasn't, no. I think there was no reward. But maybe worth twenty-five dollars something, I think. It was twenty-five, if I remember right. But there was five hundred dollars to get him out and the lawyers used to get this guy out and squeeze all the pennies, use up all the money. DIXON: So, in other words, once you actually on Ellis, in order to get on bail you had to get five hundred dollars. NOVEL: Yes. 1931 we're talking about. I'm talking about the aliens, not 1942 when they would be enemy aliens. DIXON: 1942. Ellis was busy in 1931 NOVEL: Oh, beautiful in 1942. DIXON: It was busy, though, a lot of people, a lot of boats going off? NOVEL: Busy, yes. Actually, up front where the seldom went was the visiting room. The back of that was all rooms with bars, like a jail. It wasn't the enemy section. It was the one behind that was all the enemy aliens and POWs. Some from U-Boats, some from German ships, you know, that was captured. Then they used to be processed to Springfield, Colorado to different camps for interment. DIXON: Did you ever see immigrants coming in the port or just displaced aliens were there? There were no immigrants, like people coming in? NOVEL: No, there was no immigration in 1942. First of all, there was no ship coming because of the war. And then, immigrants that came after probably got the paper from the consulate country, and they used to come in as a passenger and visit to the piers. DIXON: It was, I think, handled differently in those years. Have we left anything out you can think of? You talked about Ellis in 1931 and your escape. NOVEL: Well, the only thing I can think of, there should be something put about the enemy aliens on Ellis Island to show the future visitors. And please put those two ships. They would look so beautiful there. DIXON: I will mention what you suggested about that. I don't know. NOVEL: God bless them! If I was a Rockefeller, I would give you all the monies to fix that damn thing. It's a shame that a state like New York and New Jersey, which this is between, have let a thing like that go down to hell. DIXON: Well, they're working on those .They're going to change that. They're trying to fix it up. It's very expensive to do. But it will be changed before long, I think. NOVEL: Well, it takes time because, you know. I tell you, that boat should be going all the time. That's nice for the work on the waterfront, same as the waterfront that what do you call them never fixed, Brooklyn Piers and New York Piers. The Port Authority, they would do nothing. The Waterfront Commission and they chased everybody for how long because for them, Hitler investigation, like Gestapo. They investigated everybody, some good men out there. Some guys maybe for a little crime, they cannot get a job back no more. That's not nice. People one mistake and pay for it, should at least be entitled to get a job back. And these guys, they act like supermen, which I had to solve the case. They can't solve a case. They was sitting on the, what do you call, the primed cord one time and give a longshoreman a ticket for smoking. They were sitting on dynamite and they didn't know what it was! That's the Waterfront Commission officers! I saw them with my own eyes. DIXON: Well, it sounds like you were a good immigrant to finally get into the country, a good citizen to finally get in. I enjoyed talking to you. Thank you very much. NOVEL: I enjoyed it myself.
