LEVINE: What did people do there for work? AGRO: Well, the women don't work. LEVINE: The women don't work. AGRO: Don't work. Just the men work in the office. There's a lot of offices. Everybody know people they work on the farm, but they go in the morning and they come in the night. Well, that's the very, farm, you know, just like my father, you know, was a farmer.

AGRO: No. We know, you know, my brother, but we don't make no cake. We don't make no cake, we don't put no candles, no. Not just like here. I've been living here seventy years ago, was the same thing. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Did you celebrate anything? AGRO: We celebrated Christmas. Not just like here, Christmas. Christmas means all family, making dinner. We make a special bread, you know, just like a cake, you know, things, but not just like here. The present we'll get over there, different, different holiday we get a present. You know, the day when people die. MRS. AGRO'S DAUGHTER: All souls. LEVINE: All Souls Day? AGRO: Yeah. That's the one we'll get, my father used to, my father, now I know it was my father, he make believe the people die, they bring. But one night me and my sister make believe we're asleep and we see my father and my mother put all the dishes over there, cookies, a little money, and a sugar dollar, gorgeous. And that's it, every one. LEVINE: And who, as a child, who were you, who were you supposed to believe did that? AGRO: Just like my brother was dead, and God, all my grandparents, yeah. That's . . . LEVINE: The ones that already had died. AGRO: That's right. That was the big holiday, better than Christmas. LEVINE: Uh-huh. What day was that? Do you remember what day? AGRO: November 2nd. MRS. AGRO'S DAUGHTER: All Souls Day. LEVINE: So did you ever go to school? AGRO: Oh, yes, oh, sure. LEVINE: And what was the school like? Can you tell me anything about your school? AGRO: Just like here. You know, we go to school every day, it be nice. And we have to listen to the teacher. We have recreation in lunch time, I think half hour. We go outside. And then we go home and we do homework. Oh, sure. LEVINE: Did you have to do any chores, or did you have any work to do when you were a little girl? AGRO: No, no. Just to be nice with the family, no. We had things in the house to do, you know. We had a big family. I used to do, you know when you read, I was a little young. But started to nine or ten years, I used to do all the bread. And for twelve people I used to make twelve, uh . . . LEVINE: Loaves? AGRO: Loaf, myself, you know. We used to wash clothes. LEVINE: Where did you wash them? AGRO: In the, oh, we have a big thing. Just like, I don't know how they call it here. Making believe it's a tub, but a big one. We used to wash two here and three of the big things. Oh, yes. LEVINE: Now, did you have running water in your house? AGRO: We had water, but limit. We can't use and use and use. We got so much we're going to use, we have water. We have a toilet, we have two, one upstairs and one downstairs. LEVINE: Now, did your family live in a whole house? Was the house, you had one house? AGRO: Oh, yes. One house, but it wasn't big, you know, big house, four rooms. Those days was a big house, not just like now. You need five rooms, but there are no kids here now. And when we came from Italy we cried because in Italy we had a beautiful home. Now you, why you came here? Because my father wasn't having no job. And when we came here, my mother had two rooms. You see, my mother came first. They make a decision, my father. The best thing to do, you don't got no job. See, I have a sister here before my mother. So my mother sent me, my mother, and one son, the old one, came here, and then we'll come. And that's what we did. LEVINE: Well, now, who came first? AGRO: My mother. Well, first came my brother, long, long time, and he die. LEVINE: And then did he write to you, so that he told you what it was like here? AGRO: No, no, no, no, no, no. Then come two sisters. LEVINE: Oh. AGRO: Then my mother came, because my father lost the job, and my brother. We did things, when my mother's here, then we'll come, the rest of the family. In fact, after me and my sister came. We find, we can't find my mother here and my brother. And we find my mother in two rooms. LEVINE: Okay. Let's wait on the part about getting here. Let's talk a little bit more about Sicily before you came here. AGRO: Okay. LEVINE: Now, do you remember what you had heard about the United States before you ever came? AGRO: Yes, that's a miracle, miracle, miracle, a lot of money, but it was not true, not true. Because anybody that comes, if (?), they come here and cry. (?) Number one, you can't speak English. And this is a number one, all right? Then especially if you come from my country, my town, we don't work in Italy. Now I think they work, but we don't work. And then we find my mother in two rooms. Those days they lived a dozen people in two rooms. I know. Now it's a difference. So we were, you know, we expected to find my mother, of course, I had a sister here, a married sister with the kids, she have a nice house, yeah, my sister Mary. She had hot water. She had a tub. She had a steam. In those days, it was a beautiful rooms. We used to go over there to take a bath once a week. And then we didn't have no light. My mother's supposed to put a quarter. One night we didn't got no quarter, we didn't even have light. She was supposed to put a quarter. LEVINE: Now, what did you have for light in Sicily? AGRO: Well, we have a light. First, when I was young, we have a big, just like when it get dark, big things. LEVINE: Like a kerosene lantern. AGRO: Yes, yes. No kerosene, more beautiful, more beautiful. Just like (?). But then, before I came here, they put light. Oh, yes. A lot of people die, they put the light. So when we came here we saw a big difference. So we came, you know, my, for two weeks you see dancing in the house, you know. All the people they know from the time they came, they played the things, the old- fashioned things. LEVINE: The music? AGRO: Sure. My mother got some, my aunt, then she, yeah. And every night it was beautiful. Dancing, singing, people coming, calling for my mother, cooking, this and that. And then we ask to my brother, "When we got to go to work?" My brother said, "Don't worry about it. You go to work. Stay another week home." So finally we went to work. It was terrible. Always cry. LEVINE: Where did you go? AGRO: We went, it was embroidered things, you know, little towel, pillow. And I remember 14th, 14th Street. But we was crying because we can't talk. We can't say anything. The people was very nice. You know, me and my sister. We was crying. So my brother says, "See? You want to go to work? Now look!" You know. And then there was, we don't work any more over there. I worked to finish dress, different trade, you know. It was so bad. You know, it takes time, you know, not so easy, not so easy. Maybe now, all right, the people that are coming from other countries, they feel better. But those days it was more, very bad. My mother no have hot water, my mother no have a tub. We have a toilet in the yard. 14th Street, we live. A lot of people, they have the toilet in the yard. LEVINE: Was your mother sorry she had come at first? AGRO: Yes, oh, sure. Then my brother came, then my father came, and then all family's here, yeah. And then things, you know, better. But you're in a different country. We no have a thing, just like now. Oh, no, no, no, no. LEVINE: Well, when you decided, when you came over here, do you remember leaving the village? AGRO: Oh, sure. LEVINE: What was that like, leaving the village, knowing that you probably wouldn't come back? AGRO: Well, don't forget, I was getting to see my mother. No better thing than to go see the mother. LEVINE: Yeah. So you wanted to see your mother. And then did, and then, what, what did, how did you leave the town? What transportation? AGRO: When we went to the . . . LEVINE: To the ship. AGRO: Oh. We were very, just like here. Wait a minute. When you go Pennsylvania Station. LEVINE: The train? AGRO: Oh, sure. LEVINE: You took a train to the ship? AGRO: From the house we went with a carriage, with a carriage, the house to the station. And then we went by train from my own town to Palermo. And then we, to Palermo we went Naples with the boat, name of Guglielmo Peirce. LEVINE: Was, did anything happen on that trip? Do you remember that trip at all? What was that like? AGRO: Very bad, very bad. Still very long. I don't remember, I think it was there, twenty-five days. And a few days was away, the people, they screamed, and then they cry. They call all the saints, God. But I was young, I didn't even go these things. I was walking around, walking around. My sister, no. My sister, she was sick. She was sick in a chair. I used to say to people, "Look at my sister, look at my sister, look at my sister." Yes. I was just like a tomboy, really, really. LEVINE: Was there anything enjoyable in the ship for you? AGRO: Nah, fell in love with this fellow, you know. ( they laugh ) Walking around. And then this fellow, do you believe, they lived where I did, across 14th Street. LEVINE: He went to 14th Street, too? AGRO: Yeah, yes. (?) wanted me to ask to go out. Yeah. I didn't go out. Yes. LEVINE: Now, did you know a lot of people then around 14th Street that had come from your town? AGRO: No. LEVINE: No. AGRO: No. LEVINE: But were there a lot of people from Sicily, people that you could talk with and everything around you where you were on 14th Street? AGRO: Just like, we call paisani, yes, oh, yes. Yes, yes. That's why they used to come when we came. Every night, every night. By day they disappear, for two weeks they came, and then everybody went to work and went here and there, and would cry and cry and cry. This is America? ( laughter is heard off mike ) No hot water? No tub? My mother no able to suffer like this. Not just my mother, don't forget, a lot of people those days. Because, you know, we used to, Sunday, my mother, my brother, they used to take it to visit sick people, because they came, and then they got to go back to, you know, to appreciate they came. They now have a nice house. They no have, you know. It's a difference. Now, boy! LEVINE: What was it like learning English? How did you learn English? AGRO: Very hard, very hard. Very special, well, I learn English with my children. Because every time I used to speak in Italian they repeat, "What? What? What?" So then I started. And people, you know, people at work, you have to. You know, little by little, little by little, that's it. I used to work mostly with Jewish people, so you have to, you know. LEVINE: Did you become a citizen at some point? AGRO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. LEVINE: Did you have to go to classes? AGRO: No, they gave me a book. I remember this. I don't know how I did, but I enjoyed the class. Now if I got to be, I don't think I remember, honestly. Me and my sister, my sister, too. They give a book. LEVINE: And so, let's see.

But then we were afraid to go out, you know. LEVINE: So what happened with your father? Was he able to find work here? AGRO: No, then he, no. Where? My father office man. That's, he was old when he came. All the people they know from the home town, they respected my father. He belonged to the club, you know. Every time they let him do speech, because all these people, they used to work my father. People that came . . . ( voice off mike ) They have a lot of respect for my father. LEVINE: So your father was a big person. AGRO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. LEVINE: Well, now, what was your father like? Can you remember any experience? AGRO: Here?

But with the difference in the price, I used to pay fourteen dollars, 10th Street, four beautiful rooms, but no steam. And Second Avenue I used to pay thirty-two dollars. That was nice. But the thing is, they robbed me three times. LEVINE: Say that again. AGRO: Break, break in the house three times. MRS. AGRO'S DAUGHTER: Burglarize. AGRO: Three times. LEVINE: On 14th or 10th? AGRO: 14th, 14th. So my husband was so disgusted with the two little girls, they never go downstairs, you know, 14th Street. We moved, we bought a house, Williston Park. Beautiful home. I live over there I think forty years. I raise over there, I have my son here, Williston Park. LEVINE: When you think back over your life, what are you proudest of that you've done? What makes you feel proud that you did? AGRO: He did, my husband? LEVINE: That you did. AGRO: Well, I came to this country, I married. My family all here. I got three children, very nice. I got grandchildren, yes. Once in a while I think, I think of my home town once in a while in the night. I remember all my friends when I used to play. My mother, when she was in the night, with a long, we have no electrical. My mother used to do all the stocking, repair. But then we have the lady with the machine, I do the stocking. And then, and my father told stories, you know, a lot of stories. LEVINE: Your father told stories? AGRO: Oh, sure. LEVINE: Do you remember any stories? Do you remember the gist of any of them? AGRO: Continuous. My father, anything we talk, he gave a story. LEVINE: Oh. AGRO: All the time, all the time. I mean, it's nice. I remember all, I remember the whole town. Most every night I think all these things, all my friends, yes, yes. LEVINE: Did you keep contact with any of your friends? AGRO: No, no. LEVINE: Have you gone back to your town at all? AGRO: No. We went in Italy, but then when we reached Palermo, they said it was very bad to go to women. I went with my daughter. I tell you the truth, I was disappointed, because I liked to go to my home town. But if I go now, they're all dead. That's me. ( she laughs ) They're old. LEVINE: Can you imagine how different your life would have been if you'd stayed there? AGRO: Oh, it would have been nice. LEVINE: It would have been nice. AGRO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Because now, see, even here was very tough. It was very tough. This is not easy. People, they can't, they have three or four people, they have a board, because they can't pay the little rent. MRS. AGRO'S DAUGHTER: Boarders. AGRO: No. I mean, we have no way to go in hot water. I mean, the same thing. Now you go in Italy they got everything. I went to my nephew, he's got a condominium. He's got a piano, he's got a refrigerator, everything. This is just like now. All over. People, they think it was like easy. No, no, no. Nobody have a car those days. Once in a while they use a car. I remember in Italy if you wanted a car, when it was supposed to come, everybody said, "Come on, check it out! The car is going to pass, the car is going to pass!" ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Do you remember Ellis Island in particular when you first came here? AGRO: Oh, yes. LEVINE: What do you remember about it? AGRO: Well, I see we start the Statue of Liberty, Liberta. LEVINE: Do you remember the big building where you went in? AGRO: I went, I went in, the Statue, yeah, my husband took me . . . LEVINE: I mean when you first came, when you were fifteen years old and you came off the ship and you went to the Ellis Island, big building. AGRO: Yes, yes. LEVINE: Do you remember the doctors examining you? AGRO: Yeah, sure, yes, yes. These doctors, they examined your hair. Oh, boy. They examined your eyes, and your hair, and they passed. Some they got something, but we passed, thank God. Oh, sure Some they just like in a gate. You know? I was no trouble at all. LEVINE: Okay. Well, can you think of anything else that you might want to mention about life in Italy or in Sicily or coming here? Or what it's like now in your life? AGRO: I think this country's nice, but when the people don't speak very good, it's not so easy. See, if I was in Italy I'd belong to the club, I'd do a lot of, you know, a lot of things. Even if I could go, but you don't feel correct to speak nice. Especially if you go now, it's better than America over there. Now the women are working over there. They got offices, they got everything. I'm glad I'm here, because my family was born here, I'm here, everything nice, thank God. We can't complain. But maybe now if I got to leave New York for Italy, I don't think I could go leave. Because I'm here all my life here. Because I went in Italy, I thought, my God, even the food is a difference, because when we cook we put, you know, a lot of things rich, nice. I don't think now they do this over there. I think it is still the best country, it is the best country. Oh, yes, oh, yes. It is the best country. LEVINE: Okay. That sounds like a good place to end. AGRO: Oh, yes. LEVINE: And I'd like to thank you very much. AGRO: Oh, it was pleasant. LEVINE: Good, good. And I'm, this is Janet Levine signing off for the National Park Service, and I've been speaking with Beatrice Agro.
