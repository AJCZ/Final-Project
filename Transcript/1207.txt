BOCKOVEN: Now Mr. Nersesian, first could you tell me a little bit about your home in Europe. NERSESIAN: In Europe? BOCKOVEN: Yes. NERSESIAN: I wasn't born in Europe. I was born in Armenia, Turkish Armenia. As I was a young boy, I was in school every day except summer vacation. Back in 1915 where the massacre in our nation, in Armenia, wipe out all the army and people . But I had a Turkish friend. OTHER VOICE: He comes from a very big family, about seventeen, eighteen. They were all killed. NERSESIAN: Yes. OTHER VOICE: And they had this turk friend that was very friendly with them for years, and he came and took him over and saved his life. So after the war was over and then he came and found his aunt and then he worked as a young kid to support his aunt. And then later on, around 1921, 1922, he escaped to Syria because he didn't have anyone else there, see, and then his aunt, and he has a sister which is a little younger than he is, they came to Syria. Alright, you say the rest now. NERSESIAN: She said Syria, but I wasn't exactly--I had in my mind--I didn't my mind there to go to Syria because it happened that way. OTHER VOICE: But he escaped there. NERSESIAN: Because I was a young boy about seventeen, eighteen years old. But I had a good job. I never go hungry because I was working in a bakery. OTHER VOICE: He had a loaf of bread a day. NERSESIAN: Yes, you don't go hungry in a bakery. So for a while I thought I stay there, but on I hear Armenian run away from Turkey, just like today the Soviet Union, you know, they don't like the regime. They go out. So I decided to escape the Turkey, come into Free World, but we were three boys. We had a guide, you know. OTHER VOICE: They hired a guide to direct them through the mountains. NERSESIAN: He was not a Turk, but he was a . So we decided to go with him. OTHER VOICE: They paid so much to get them free to Syria so they could escape to America. They could come to America. NERSESIAN: We came to Syria. BOCKOVEN: So was your plan to go to America an your first stop was Syria? OTHER VOICE: Yes, they would have to come to Syria. NERSESIAN: Just as soon as I come to Syria I write to my uncle. He lives in . About three years ago he died. You know, just as soon as I come into the United States, I called him up... OTHER VOICE: When you came to Syria. NERSESIAN: I write to my uncle. He send me money. He said, "I arrange everything to the United States." Because my father was in the United States then. There is my father over there. OTHER VOICE: Most of his life he spent in the United States. NERSESIAN: He lives in become a citizen, but in order to become a citizen, you have to have a first paper. He had a first paper, but he never got the second paper. OTHER VOICE: Because he was coming back with his family, but they didn't give him a chance, they killed him. NERSESIAN: So he brought me to the United States, but I got out in order . I got . But I didn't get out because I want to escape the , but my uncle says, "No, you will stay there. I will take care of you." OTHER VOICE: Because he had Trachoma, you see. NERSESIAN: I didn't know that my uncle was--I was operated on my eyes in Syrian city, Aleppo. BOCKOVEN: Oh, so they discovered that you had trachoma in Syria? OTHER VOICE: Yes, they operated on him, and he thought he was cured, but he wasn't. NERSESIAN: The doctor wasn't exactly a surgeon, you know. OTHER VOICE: What was he? NERSESIAN: He didn't know anything about--an ordinary doctor. So he made a wrong incision, but at that time I was cured. But later on it grows up again. He didn't break up the , so it grows back again. So I come into France. I went to the doctor. He look at me and says, "You got trachoma." I said, "Can you take care of it?" He said, "Yes. I'll take it out, but not right away," he said, "it take three, four weeks before I can cure you." I went every day until my eyes are . He was putting in some medicine, you know. It hurts. But later on he says, "Now you are alright. You are ." OTHER VOICE: That means that's cured. But when he came in the boat to get out they found out it wasn't. NERSESIAN: I come into the boat, in between this time my eyes still got trachoma. BOCKOVEN: So they examined you when you got off the boat? OTHER VOICE: Island. NERSESIAN: They brought her out to Boston. Later on they brought her out to Boston. I was the end of January. OTHER VOICE: Where was it you landed? NERSESIAN: Later on they took me hospital. OTHER VOICE: Where was it you landed in Providence? NERSESIAN: I landed in Providence November 1st. BOCKOVEN: Now when you came to the United States, first of all, what year was this? OTHER VOICE: 1922. BOCKOVEN: 1922. Okay. NERSESIAN: In 1922 I landed in Providence, but my eyes, they put me down. They were trying to deport me, you know. BOCKOVEN: Because of your disease? NERSESIAN: Yes, because of my eyes. Later on when I hear the deporting date, they are going to deport me, I telephone my uncle, they wanted me to deport to France again because my eyes were bad. He said, "No," he said, "don't worry about it. I'll take care of you. You are not going to be deported." So he arranged it with the congressman, you know. He has the congressman. He put a fine, two thousand dollars. He said, "I want my nephew be treated in the hospital." So they take me right away the next day before the . I mean they took me to Providence, put him on a boat. they lock me up in a room with bars on it. BOCKOVEN: Why? In providence this was? OTHER VOICE: Yes. Well, they were planning to send him back again. NERSESIAN: Yes, a little bit. I understand more than I speak but anyway, I went there and he says, "Your uncle wants you not to be deported." He said, "You will be staying in the United States." Oh boy, I was so happy. I thought I got to go home. OTHER VOICE: Thought he was going back. NERSESIAN: But he says, "Oh, no." He said, "you are not going to go home," he says, "But they want to take you to Ellis Island." BOCKOVEN: I see. Do you know why you were stopped off in Providence? Don't they usually come to New York? OTHER VOICE: No, there are some boats come to Providence, excuse me, and some land in New York. That is like certain lines they have certain stations. NERSESIAN: I was coming to Federal Line Company. The ship I come to, the name is the Providence. I love that name Providence. So, the company ships come into Rose Island, they have to ship where their company is. So that is it. BOCKOVEN: So instead of deporting you, they brought you to Ellis Island? NERSESIAN: Yes. They bring up Ellis Island. This immigration officer, very considerate man, you know, and he come in and he says, "My boy," he says, "I want to take you to New York." I said, "Why you want to take me to New York?" He said, "Your eyes are bad." He said, "We are going to take you to the hospital down there so they can cure you." So I was happy for anything else. I was so happy. I said, "Alright, I will come with you." So we took the train to Connecticut. I don't know what this was exactly, Hartford or New Briton or somewhere else. They took us over there. they put us in a boat. So next morning we got in New York, next morning. So in New York they have a small ship that takes us to Ellis Island. They call it, I don't know what. OTHER VOICE: Ferry? NERSESIAN: A ferry, yes. BOCKOVEN: So when you arrived at Ellis Island, what happened then? NERSESIAN: They took me over where the old people, young people... OTHER VOICE: They were all mixed up. NERSESIAN: All mixed up. It was about 18, 20 people in a ward. They took me down there. They never tried to look at my eyes or anything else, but I didn't see any doctor, you know. I stayed there for about three weeks. I said, "This is not a hospital," I says. BOCKOVEN: You didn't receive any treatment during those three weeks? OTHER VOICE: At the beginning he did. NERSESIAN: A lot of boys, they had bad eyes, trachoma and everything else, ever Chinese. Chinese there. And he said, "My eyes are in a trachoma." I says, "They put me in here." I said, "They going to treat your eyes?" He said, "No." He said, "They are going to deport me back again, China." So I wrote my uncle again, you know, and I said, "Please tell Mary... OTHER VOICE: That is his aunt. NERSESIAN: My Aunt Mary to write a letter to her doctor because my eyes, they don't take care of me. So she wrote a sympathetic letter, you know. I see a doctor in, but he comes in and he doesn't look at anybody's eyes. Right away I see a doctor, I took the letter to him. I said, "Doctor," I said, "Please, this is for you." He opened up and read it and that was the end. He would look at me and said, "I want to see your eyes." So he looked at me and called out the nurse, male nurse. These is no female nurse down there, male nurse. He said, "I want you yo prepare this boy," he says, "and until tomorrow I come in certain hours, I want to look at his eyes." So he took hot water with some cotton. He closed my eyes. Oh, about a half an hour like that. All of a sudden the doctor come in, look at me. He says, "You got troublesome eyes." I didn't say anything. "Doctor," I says, "they operated on me twice, but there was some trachoma in there." He says, "Don't worry," you know. The next morning he come in, my eyes he puts some kind of medicine. I don't know if , but he put my eyes and oh, it hurts, it hurts. So I was almost crying, you know. About three months every other day he was looking at me,every other day. There was an Italian boy with me, but his eyes, even myself only I was treated by the doctors. All the rest of them not treated. BOCKOVEN: Just . OTHER VOICE: See, they didn't do anything until the letter came from his aunt saying, "Well, he is the only one saved out of twenty-five, out of one family. We want to do everything to keep him here." And then when the doctor read that letter and then he started taking care of him, otherwise he says they were all in there but they never looked at them or anything. They just gave a meal or so and that was all. BOCKOVEN: And these other people, were they eventually deported? OTHER VOICE: I don't know what happened. What happened to the other people? NERSESIAN: I don't know. OTHER VOICE: Well, how long were you there, Jack? NERSESIAN: I was there the first of February, they were deport me to France, but ten days later, say February 10th, I was transferred to Ellis Island. From February to June 1st. June 1st. BOCKOVEN: Several months. NERSESIAN: Yes. BOCKOVEN: And when you were at Ellis Island having your treatments, were you in a hospital or were you just in Ellis Island? NERSESIAN: No. The same ward all the rest of the boys were. BOCKOVEN: Did you have room to sleep? NERSESIAN: Yes. See, they have a ward, beds and everything else. OTHER VOICE: They are all in one place. BOCKOVEN: And how did they feed you? NERSESIAN: They fed us well. We had everyday each plate, we not going in a mess hall like that. OTHER VOICE: Did they serve you in the hospital? NERSESIAN: Yes, in the hospital just like they bring up a plate, everything, coffee and everything else. OTHER VOICE: Tray. NERSESIAN: Tray up. Well, I don't say we didn't eat well. We were fed well. We had a library about two, three, about fifteen steps away, library is near. BOCKOVEN: Could you read? Were your eyes affected for reading? NERSESIAN: Yes. I could read. I wasn't closed up. OTHER VOICE: Well, I mean did the doctors allow you to read? NERSESIAN: Yes. I could read, but only the day that I was treated I didn't read then because sore eyes. The next day I was all right. BOCKOVEN: And how often did he treat you? Every other day? NERSESIAN: Every other day, three time a week, three times a week. BOCKOVEN: And he put medicine in your eyes. NERSESIAN: Yes. BOCKOVEN: Did he operate on you. NERSESIAN: No, he didn't operate on me. He some medicine down there, but that medicine I know cures a lot of things like boils and everything else and cures it but eats it. BOCKOVEN: Did you have the same doctor the whole time that you were there? NERSESIAN: Yes, all the time that there, the same doctor. he had stripes on his arm because the World War was on , but is 1923, he is allowed the . OTHER VOICE: He was in the uniform in other words. NERSESIAN: Uniform, yes. His name was Ward. BOCKOVEN: Doctor Ward? NERSESIAN: Doctor Ward. he told me, he said, "Hagop," he says, "When you go home, you wear eyeglasses. You take care of your eyes, eyesight." BOCKOVEN: So it did cure you? You never had anymore problems? NERSESIAN: No. I never had any problems. It wasn't that. He took me to the higher up doctors, you know, two or three of them like that, and joe and I went together, he look at me, my eyes. "Good, is good." You looked Joe's eyes and he say... OTHER VOICE: Who is Joe? NERSESIAN: "Is fine," he says, "now you can go home," he says. OTHER VOICE: Who is Joe? NERSESIAN: Joe is Italian fellow. OTHER VOICE: Oh, the Italian fellow, he was with you. NERSESIAN: Twenty-two or twenty-three years old, Italian fellow. His father lived in New York. What is that ? BOCKOVEN: Oh, yes. I can't remember . NERSESIAN: Can't remember now--Brooklyn. He was the name Brooklyn. He was a barber, Joe the barber. He was giving me haircut. OTHER VOICE: Oh, you had a free haircut? NERSESIAN: Free haircut. BOCKOVEN: So he was also treated for trachoma? Joe and you? NERSESIAN: Yes, he was treated for trachoma. Him and me examined same day, he treated, both of us. But I don't know whether... OTHER VOICE: What happened to the rest? NERSESIAN: He had a letter from , but I don't know. It happens. It happens. He was with me all the time. BOCKOVEN: So you became pretty good friends? NERSESIAN: Yes, we were good friends, good friends. BOCKOVEN: Did your uncle or your father and your aunt visit you at Ellis Island? Were they permitted to visit you? NERSESIAN: My uncle was. OTHER VOICE: His father was killed. They wiped out all his family. He was the only one and his sister were saved. BOCKOVEN: Did any of your relatives that were in the United States come to visit you? NERSESIAN: No. I had visitors while I was in Boston. OTHER VOICE: But it was pretty hard. He was in business in Salem, you know. He couldn't very well leave to... NERSESIAN: My cousin, was in this country, you know, and his family and all. My other distance, he come in and see me one time. BOCKOVEN: So you could have visitor? They allowed you to have people visit you? NERSESIAN: In Boston. Not Ellis Island. BOCKOVEN: Okay. Now, when did you go to Boston? OTHER VOICE: Providence. NERSESIAN: I was in Boston November 1st. BOCKOVEN: Before you came to Ellis Island? NERSESIAN: Before I come into Providence, they put a ship it Boston. So I stay and so they took me in a county hospital in Boston. Then I was free practically. I was going out and walk around and everything else and come back. OTHER VOICE: What were they doing at county Hospital? Did they... NERSESIAN: I was in the--taking my clothes and everything else, no. I have my clothes on. I used to go out and two or three times a day would take a walk and everything else. I come back then. BOCKOVEN: Were they curing your eyes in Boston? NERSESIAN: No, they didn't cure me, but they would take me in the hospital because they didn't want all of us at the--they were afraid of contagious. BOCKOVEN: Okay, so that's why they... OTHER VOICE: Well, why they let you go out then if it was contagious? NERSESIAN: I couldn't answer that. BOCKOVEN: Yes, that seems a little funny. Well, now what could you do at Ellis Island besides you slept there, you ate there, you could read? NERSESIAN: Yes. The rest of the time I was in the library, I was librarian help, you see. We were taking books into the other patients. BOCKOVEN: I see, so you had a job at Ellis Island. NERSESIAN: Yes. This librarian, she was a well-educated lady, but she had a diploma over several languages. BOCKOVEN: Could you speak much English at that time? NERSESIAN: Well, I could speak a little bit I was young, they were teaching the school. We take French and English, one year, last year English, but French two years. You know, in the old country they want to take foreign languages while the children are small. They learn quick. BOCKOVEN: Right, that is the smart way to do it. NERSESIAN: That's why they were teaching it. OTHER VOICE: In grammar school, they teach the languages to children. NERSESIAN: Grammar school. BOCKOVEN: ...grammar school NERSESIAN: Yes, I used to--besides the Armenian, we used to have a Turkish too, Turkish. It was a compulsory state. You have to learn the Turkish in order to become a conversation, you know what it is because a lot of people, they didn't care for learn other languages. So my uncle has a son, he sent him to Turkish college, you know. But his father was a smart man. He was a head of because like say every time a garment of work was being done he used to write a letter and everything else. The was a big man. He was so smart. OTHER VOICE: In other words, he had been well educated in the English language, so when there was any letter to be written to the government, wee, he has to do it. BOCKOVEN: He must have had a very responsible job. NERSESIAN: Yes. BOCKOVEN: Now when you left Ellis Island, what did you do then? NERSESIAN: When I left Ellis Island, because I was with my uncle. OTHER VOICE:See, his uncle has a business and he was working there. NERSESIAN: I went to six months in the American school. OTHER VOICE: Day school? NERSESIAN: Day school, yes. Some kind of school was all foreigners coming together, you know, to learn the language before they took them to a different grade. BOCKOVEN: And then you worked for your uncle? NERSESIAN: I worked for my uncle. BOCKOVEN: And what did you do? What was your job? NERSESIAN: He had a grocery market and confectionery store and everything else. BOCKOVEN: So again, you didn't have to worry about food. NERSESIAN: No. BOCKOVEN: When did you become a citizen? NERSESIAN: I was, you know, I was twenty-four years old, so I make my mind to become a citizen. I told my friends I want to become a U.S.A. citizen. They were all laughing at me. They say, "I don't think you become a citizen because they don't accept you." I said, "Why?" He said, "A lot of people we know, the First World War, the army and they ask them about going in the service and they say they won't go in the service because it happened to be one of the is rescued or something like that, who is going to support them." If the government will guarantee support my family or something like that, he says. No, I am the only support in the family in the United States. If you have a wife or a child or something like that, won't take care of us, but we don't take no foreigners. So a lot of them didn't want to go. Some went. OTHER VOICE: But you weren't at the age. NERSESIAN: Margo didn't go, but my cousin, he went in the service because he had nobody. OTHER VOICE: He had a big family to support, you know. He had four children. NERSESIAN: So while I was in the old country give her a little freedom, you know. My uncle sent fifty dollars in order to or not. He took a chance. OTHER VOICE: Well, during and after the war he didn't know if there was anybody left so he sent fifty dollars to the American Consulate there, Mr. Reeves, saying, "If I have any relatives living, let me know and give this money so I could send some more." So through that he discovered that they were alive. BOCKOVEN: Did your sister come with you in the same... NERSESIAN: No. OTHER VOICE: No. He escaped because the man, they would let the women come, but they wouldn't let the men, so he had to escape. NERSESIAN: I escaped the country. But later on the whole Armenians come together, get out of the country. OTHER VOICE: You know, Americans, they have orphanages there. They move all the orphanages to Syria, Beirut, Lebanon and different places. And then the other people could come. But the man, well, he was allowed to be in the service. He was about 18, 19, and they wouldn't let them come, so he had escape. That was the whole reason. NERSESIAN: After I escaped, all the Armenians, they had permission to leave the country. My aunt and my sister, my aunt is about forty years old then. My sister was seventeen years old. I didn't know they were permitted to leave the country. That is why I run away from them. Because we had a lot of property down there. We could have sold it, but we didn't know anything about it. we left everything there and came over here. BOCKOVEN: Had to start over again. NERSESIAN: Yes. Well, last time I went to Ellis Island, my granddaughter and my grandson and my son and myself... OTHER VOICE: He was visiting there. He said, "Dad, I'm going to take you somewhere that you would like to see." NERSESIAN: There are a lot of people visiting Ellis Island, you know. They had a guard in there and explained everything else. I said, "It doesn't look the same to me, this Ellis Island." It is different. The guide, he heard me. He said, "You were here at Ellis Island?" I said, "I was here 55 years ago." You should have seen the reaction there. A lot of people wanted to know what happened to the Ellis Island. Is there really people living down there? BOCKOVEN: Well, that's right. That must have been the visit when they found out that they wanted someone to interview you, and they called us up. NERSESIAN: Yes. OTHER VOICE: Do you live in Beverly? BOCKOVEN: Yes. NERSESIAN: ...but says, "No, they are not taking me to walk through the corridor." ...goes over the head. They have to bar everything else down there. They are fixing contribution if we can toward this rebuilding Ellis Island. The government don't help any, but are like that probably would help. OTHER VOICE: When your uncle was paying them a hundred dollars... NERSESIAN: No, no, no. Not a hundred dollars, no. People don't live down there the winter and everything else. ...and every wall crumbles. BOCKOVEN: They need to repair them all. NERSESIAN: Just touch the wall... OTHER VOICE: The moisture and everything . NERSESIAN: ...over cement and everything else. BOCKOVEN: So are they fixing it up now or trying to? NERSESIAN: Well, it was two years ago I was there. I don't know if they are fixing it up. I suppose every time they get a few dollars like that, they try to fix it up. OTHER VOICE: Doesn't the government pay for ? BOCKOVEN: Well, yes, I would imagine that they would be able to fix it up someway. NERSESIAN: The can make a national museum, they have to fix it up because that Ellis Island is so beautiful, you know. OTHER VOICE: Really? NERSESIAN: Yes. They fix it up so beautiful. It is in the ocean. OTHER VOICE: I know. It's an island. NERSESIAN: An island. OTHER VOICE: Well, some day we will go and see it. BOCKOVEN: Maybe it will be even better next time. Well, do you have anything else that you would like to add about your experiences when you came here? NERSESIAN: Well, I'm glad to add , you know. I am going to say this. I love this country. Opportunities, or if anybody works, tries, they make a living. They can be a good citizen. There is no country other like it in the world like who want to in Russia, who--you know, ten years ago we went to Russia. I went to Russia in 1958. But... OTHER VOICE: Not '58, '68. NERSESIAN: I mean '68, yes. no matter where you go, they still love the world loves the United States. I was a citizen back in 1929. I belonged to YMCA and I went to night school. I became a first citizen then. You know, during those years a lot of people, they get to become a citizen, you know. They thought I was one of them, so immigration officers come in to see me. Said, "You are so and so?" I said, "Yes." He said, "From the immigration office want to question you." I said, "What for?" He said, "You become a citizen? You want to become a citizen?" I said, "Yes." I said, "I have application already, second application." He said, "You don't mind I ask you questions, few questions?" I said--they ask me about Civil War, about Revolutionary War, who was the governor, who was the president. I asked him. He said, "I'm very sorry. We didn't know anything about it." I says. "You are alright," he says. OTHER VOICE: The reason they asked those question, some of the people by bribery, they get their citizen papers. NERSESIAN: They told me a lot of people, they were--they were going to grab people a citizen. They say and become citizen. BOCKOVEN: So they were checking. NERSESIAN: So they won't bother you this time. So, they were happy to go back. BOCKOVEN: So it turned out alright. OTHER VOICE: Yes, he is living happily ever after. He had his own business for 26 years. BOCKOVEN: What was your business? NERSESIAN: Confectionery store and making ice cream. BOCKOVEN: Well, thank you very much for sharing your story with us.
