RICCOBONO: We sit by the anchor. SIGRIST: I see. So you'd be out on the, sun shining, fresh air. RICCOBONO: Yeah. SIGRIST: When it wasn't too rough. RICCOBONO: I, when I had a little time I went on the front of the boat and looked for the fish flying. SIGRIST: You could see the fish? RICCOBONO: Yeah. (he laughs) You know, the little flying fish. SIGRIST: Did, do you remember what they fed you on other days on the boat? What sorts of foods did they give you on the boat? Other than the hard bread and coffee you just told us about? RICCOBONO: Oh, they give us something like soup. SIGRIST: Yeah. RICCOBONO: Yeah. They take it with a big scoop and they put it down. SIGRIST: Did they give you a bowl to put that in or did you have to bring your own utensils? RICCOBONO: No, they give us a little bag, you know, little bag when you give to the children, you go to school. And on the top they got a string. SIGRIST: I see. RICCOBONO: And everything is tin. Plate tin, plate tin, tin fork and tin everything. SIGRIST: So you were supplied with everything you needed. RICCOBONO: Yeah. And when the boat go up because it was rough, go up and you see all this bag (he makes a descriptive vibrating sound) down. Then they go up, go the other way. (he makes the sound again) SIGRIST: Oh my. (he laughs) Did you ever get to meet any of the, for instance the staff on the boat? Did you ever get to talk to any of the, I don't really know what kind of staff you have on a boat, like, like the purser or the sailors or any of the people running the boat? RICCOBONO: There was one down there. He was like a foreman. He open and close and he says now is the time to go up, you know, was like a little boss. SIGRIST: I see. So he let you, he was the one who allowed you to go on deck? RICCOBONO: Yes. I forget how they call the name but then he take care of. SIGRIST: Do you remember how long the trip took? RICCOBONO: I tell you the truth, I started June twenty-seven and when we come, when we come here that was Sunday morning and they say you can't go, gotta tomorrow morning, Monday. SIGRIST: Right, because Ellis was closed. RICCOBONO: Yeah, was closed. So Sunday morning, to me it was a little long trip. I no remember how many days we stay. SIGRIST: But it was long. RICCOBONO: But it was Sunday when we come here. SIGRIST: I see. Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty when you pulled into the harbor? RICCOBONO: Sure. We come in this here, in this place. SIGRIST: Yes. Do you, um, did, when you came into New York, when the boat came into New York, did they allow you all up on deck so that you can see New York and see the Statue of Liberty? RICCOBONO: Yeah. We stay on the boat and we see the Statue of Liberty. Now we gotta go down, we gotta pass a visa, you know. So, it come down and says, "Come tomorrow. Stay on the boat."

RICCOBONO: Next morning we come here. SIGRIST: I see. RICCOBONO: And they come down and I don't remember, but we come down and give a the name and that's it. SIGRIST: When you arrived here at Ellis Island, were there lots of people here? Was it very crowded? RICCOBONO: No very crowded in that time, no. SIGRIST: So did you have to wait in line or, did you do a lot of waiting while you were here? RICCOBONO: No, no. That was fast because we no come here on the morning, you know. And it was all right. SIGRIST: I see. Do you remember, because you and your father and your sister were here, do you remember being inspected at all?

He say to me, "What you want, Riccobono?" I thought, oh yeah, all right, what you want, I want to go in business. " O.K. All right," he says, Give me piece of paper and you tell in case the business don't go, you come here, you got a job. I keep. And I was say, after a while I was go open a store. Then at night pass, look, all right and you go. Then the store I had kind of small. On night I look across the street. There was a big store. I go. I went over there, I see the sign, the owner, I write down and I went about seven, eight o'clock in the night. There was porch, I ring the bell. Who comes, my boss, he say, "What you, Joe Riccobono, how are you?" I say, "I come and see." "Come in, come in." All right, come in. In the front room he got like a little office. "Sit down, sit down." "All right." "Now, why you come?" I say, "The house and want to rent." "I sell it to you." I say "No, I ain't got no money to buy." All I rent it. I rent all the house, because on the top have four and four rooms in the back. In the store were two room in the back, big one. I rent all the house. All right. Saturday I come and make a list. Saturday afternoon he came. We go to the lawyer. We make a lease. "You got to pay the water and you gotta give me three hundred dollars a month." All right. And I move in the store, my mother on the top with the children and it work like that. He says, "I make you lease for three years." " All right, you make a lease three years." Don't pass three years he got a heart attack and he passed away. The son-in-law was engineer and he know me from there. He came, "You know my father-in-law passed away two weeks ago. Now the children, they want to sell the house. You got a lease." I say, "The lease I got in the bank." "You go get it, tomorrow I come." I bring the lease. He look at it. I say, "How much is it?" "Twelve thousand dollars." "All right, twelve thousand , I take it. But in the same time the boy buy, I had a store sell fish.

RICCOBONO: No, no. SIGRIST: Did they continue to go to church in Clifton? RICCOBONO: Yeah, sure. SIGRIST: And you, too? RICCOBONO: Yeah me, too. SIGRIST: That was still a great part of your life. RICCOBONO: I used to go in the church every Sunday, in the Mass. There was a little church and I go and the priest on time say "Now we're gonna have the children to learn a few words Italian here. Anybody that you want." Then I had my brother, young one, I tell him and he go. He so happy, he say he never forget. SIGRIST: Do you remember the name of the church? Do you remember what... RICCOBONO: Sacred Heart. SIGRIST: Sacred Heart. RICCOBONO: Yeah. SIGRIST: Clifton? RICCOBONO: Yeah. SIGRIST: So, we're going to wrap this up soon. Let me just ask you a question. So you said that you were happy that you came to America. RICCOBONO: I was happy because I don't like work over there. I work for myself. SIGRIST: Right. You had your own business. RICCOBONO: Yeah. And I started to sell Christmas tree this time of the year. SIGRIST: But did you have a Christmas tree yourself? Being Italian, did you have a Christmas tree? RICCOBONO: Over here I sell. SIGRIST: Yes, but you didn't have one in your house. RICCOBONO: No, no. I sell vegetables, plants, Happy Easter for a month and then watermelon and I was busy all time. SIGRIST: Yes, you were a hard worker. RICCOBONO: Hard worker. SIGRIST: As your father had been a hard worker. RICCOBONO: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: Well, I think this is a good place for us to stop. I want to thank you very much... RICCOBONO: Your welcome. SIGRIST: For coming here to Ellis island and sharing with us your memories. So anyway, this is Paul Sigrist signing off for the National Park Service.
