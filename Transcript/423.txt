SIGRIST: After your father died tell me a little bit how your mother kept things going. Was it really hard for her when he died? DUFFY: Oh, very hard. SIGRIST: Was she very heartbroken when he died? DUFFY: Oh my, yes. Very heartbroken. SIGRIST: Did she then have to take over all the farm responsibilities? DUFFY: Well then, then they didn't do so much on the farm, very little then. SIGRIST: So what happened to all those fields and animals? What happened... DUFFY: Well, we had animals they didn't stay out all winter. That was easy. SIGRIST: So you didn't have to get rid of anything? DUFFY: No. SIGRIST: I see. Let me ask you, your brother went to America, only one brother went to America? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Now was he writing back and forth to you? DUFFY: Oh, yes. He wrote for me to come over here. SIGRIST: Uh huh. DUFFY: He'd send me to high school. SIGRIST: What kinds of things did he tell you about America? DUFFY: He didn't say much, but he paid my way and that's when I got started and was going to come on the "Titanic". SIGRIST: Did you want to come to America? DUFFY: I was not to crazy about it, cause I wanted to go to school. SIGRIST: And you knew you wouldn't get any more schooling where you were. DUFFY: Yeah, that's right. SIGRIST: Did you ever, while living in this small town, did you ever take trips to, to some of the larger cities? DUFFY: No, no. We didn't have time and not the money either. SIGRIST: What was the hardest season for you? Was the winter harder? DUFFY: No, very nice, we were all prepared for the winter.

SIGRIST: Did you, what kinds of foods did you store for the winter? DUFFY: Potatoes and vegetables. SIGRIST: How did you store the potatoes? DUFFY: You dig a hole in the ground and put the straw over them and put the dirt over them. SIGRIST: And they'd last through the ... DUFFY: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: What was the weather like in this town? DUFFY: It's never very cold there, never. SIGRIST: Any snow ever? DUFFY: It did but the snow would go right away the next day.

DUFFY: We played the accordion. SIGRIST: Did you dance? DUFFY: Yeah. Oh, yes. SIGRIST: Did you have a piano in the house? DUFFY: No. SIGRIST: Were you from a musical family?

DUFFY: No, no. SIGRIST: So there really wasn't a whole lot to do except work. DUFFY: No, that's it. Just work. SIGRIST: Alright, so your brother is writing to you and he wants you to come to America. DUFFY: I did. SIGRIST: And you're not real thrilled about the idea. DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: What made you decide to do it? DUFFY: Well, my mother said it would be good if I could do it, so I did. SIGRIST: When you left for America, how many of your brothers and sisters were still living with your mother? DUFFY: Just two brothers and a sister. SIGRIST: I see. And do you remember, did your brother send you passage to America? DUFFY: Oh, yes. SIGRIST: Do you remember, do you remember packing? DUFFY: Oh, I do. SIGRIST: What did you take? DUFFY: Everything, not much cause, they didn't use that kind of clothing here then. SIGRIST: What kind of clothing do you mean? DUFFY: Lighter, much lighter than there. SIGRIST: Did you have a suitcase that you took? DUFFY: Oh, yes. SIGRIST: Was it your's or was it your mother's? DUFFY: My mother's. SIGRIST: She gave you her suitcase. DUFFY: Hm, hmmm. SIGRIST: Do you remember saying goodbye... DUFFY: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: To your family? Can you tell me a little bit what that felt like? DUFFY: Oh, she rode with us on the train up to the next station. SIGRIST: She went with you? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: And then you said goodbye to her? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Was that really hard for you to do? DUFFY: Oh, yeah. I never seen her any more, she died. SIGRIST: Did you think that when you were saying goodbye to her that you never would see her again? DUFFY: Oh, I hoped to, yes, to see her but I never did. SIGRIST: So you took the train, from there to where? DUFFY: To Queenstown. SIGRIST: Is that a long train ride? DUFFY: Nearly eight hours. SIGRIST: That's a long train ride. Had you ever been on a train before? DUFFY: No. SIGRIST: What was that like for you? DUFFY: Oh, nice, it was nice. SIGRIST: You liked it? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Can you kind of describe for me what the inside of the train looked like? DUFFY: Yes, it was very nice, very nice. SIGRIST: Crowded? DUFFY: Um hmm. SIGRIST: Lot of people. Did you bring, when you went on the train ride, did you bring any food to eat? DUFFY: I think we had something, I don't know what. SIGRIST: But you took something? DUFFY: Something. SIGRIST: Alright, so you arrived in Queenstown. DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: And this is in April you said. Right, you were leaving in April? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: How long did you have to stay in Queenstown? DUFFY: We stayed overnight and the next day we were all going to sail. SIGRIST: Now you say "we", is someone traveling with you? DUFFY: My cousin and my, a friend of ours. SIGRIST: Are they going to America with you or are they just going to Queenstown? DUFFY: Yes. Yes, they were going with me. SIGRIST: Alright, tell me who is this friend? You said she's a friend of yours, what... DUFFY: She's was Knockmoor, Annie Walsh from Knockmoor. SIGRIST: Annie Walsh and how did you know Annie? DUFFY: Well we used to go to the same church. SIGRIST: I see. Were you good friends or just sort of good friends? DUFFY: Oh yes. SIGRIST: Why were she coming to America? DUFFY: Made her, she was my sister-in-law. SIGRIST: Oh, that's interesting. DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Why was she coming to America? DUFFY: Well, because she liked it. SIGRIST: Did she have relatives here? DUFFY: Yes, she did. SIGRIST: Was, what was Annie like as a person? Was she... DUFFY: Oh, very nice. SIGRIST: Was she fun to be with? DUFFY: Yes. SIGRIST: What did she look like? DUFFY: I couldn't tell you now what she looked like. SIGRIST: It was a long time ago. DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: So, I'm sorry, how long did you stay in Queenstown? DUFFY: We stayed overnight, the next day we were supposed to sail but, on the Titanic, but we didn't get on there. SIGRIST: Why? DUFFY: Because it was overcrowded. SIGRIST: So, so can you kind of describe for me where, how did you find out it was overcrowded? DUFFY: We got in the small boat to go out to the big ship, to the Titanic. When we got to the door the captain opened it and said, "No one, overcrowded". SIGRIST: How did you feel about that? DUFFY: We were kind of disappointed but it was, the next day it went down. SIGRIST: So, so what did you do when they said you couldn't get on board? DUFFY: We went back to the hotel. SIGRIST: And how long did you have to wait for another boat? DUFFY: Two days. We took the Celtic. SIGRIST: The Celtic. Can you tell me what your accommodations looked like on the boat? DUFFY: Oh, that was an old ship and I was sick all the way, every day I never got out of the bunk. SIGRIST: Did you have a cabin of your own or were you in a room with lots of people? DUFFY: In the booth, in the, you know that little, what do you call them, bunk. SIGRIST: In a bunk. Was Annie sick too? DUFFY: No, they had a grand time. SIGRIST: And only you were sick. DUFFY: Yeah, I was sick. SIGRIST: So, do you remember, you probably don't remember eating on the boat if you were sick. DUFFY: I never did, never eat until I got off seven days. SIGRIST: Seven days it took to go from Queenstown? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did you have a port hole? DUFFY: Yes. SIGRIST: Where you were, so you could see outside? DUFFY: A little. The water that's all. SIGRIST: Did you ever, when did you feel better? DUFFY: When I landed on the... SIGRIST: So you were sick all the way? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: I'm just curious, I have to ask this question. Have you ever been on a big boat since then? DUFFY: No. SIGRIST: Good (he laughs). DUFFY: And I don't want to. SIGRIST: That's good. So the boat took seven days and you were not feeling well. Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? DUFFY: Oh, yes, then we got to Ellis Island. SIGRIST: And talk to me a little bit about, about getting to Ellis Island and what you saw when you got there. DUFFY: Oh that, I couldn't describe it, it was an old building, I know that. And we stayed there two days to get, you know you have to be examined and pass the inspection. SIGRIST: Were there a lot of people there? DUFFY: Yes, there was. SIGRIST: Did you pass all your exams?

SIGRIST: Doing the same kinds of things? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Which... DUFFY: Waiting on the table and light work. It was nice. They had a cook and chauffeur and laundress and all that. SIGRIST: Did you like doing that kind of domestic work or did you just sort of feel that this was what you could do? DUFFY: Yeah, well I didn't go to school, that's why. SIGRIST: I was going to say you wanted to come to America... DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: To further your schooling but it doesn't seem like... DUFFY: Well I was too homesick to go. So I don't mind. SIGRIST: Did people ever make fun of you because you were an immigrant? DUFFY: Oh, no. No. SIGRIST: Well, I guess my final question for you in this, now that we laid out your immigration experience, so are you glad you came to America? DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: Yeah. It was, even though you were homesick... DUFFY: Yeah. SIGRIST: You eventually grew to like America? DUFFY: Yes. SIGRIST: Good, good. Well I want, I want to thank you for having us come out.
