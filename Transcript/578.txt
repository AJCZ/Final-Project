LEVINE: This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm here today, it's April 27, 1993, and I'm here in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with Sonya Thornblom Gillick, who came from Sweden in 1921 when she was twelve years old. I'm very happy to be here, and I look forward to hearing your story. And maybe we can start right at the beginning, if you will give me your birth date. GILLICK: April 28, 1909. LEVINE: And do you remember the town in Sweden where you were born? GILLICK: Oh, yes. LEVINE: What was the name? GILLICK: Kalmar. LEVINE: Can you spell it, please? GILLICK: K-A-L-M-A-R. LEVINE: And did you live in Kalmar the entire time before you left Sweden? GILLICK: Yes, for twelve years. LEVINE: For twelve years, okay. Just, when you think of Kalmar, what is it that you recall about the town? GILLICK: Well, I recall my school days, the good and the bad, the fun we had. LEVINE: What did you do for fun? GILLICK: Well, for fun, in the winter we had, they made a big hill and froze it, and we could use it for sleigh riding. And during recess in school, we came by sleigh. Everybody brought their sleigh. We went out there and for an hour or so we, you know, could ride down the hill. Because at night the adults took it over. LEVINE: To sleigh ride? GILLICK: Yes, yes. To, you know, ride, bellywhopping, we call it. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: Well, you took your sleighs to school? GILLICK: Yes. We could hitch a ride behind some, I can't say automobile because they weren't there then. ( she coughs ) Hitched to a wagon, you know, a horse and wagon would come along, and they'd say, "Hitch on and we'll take you." You know, we'd ride. And it was fun. LEVINE: Was it dangerous? GILLICK: No. There was no traffic. There was no danger. And the roads were, you know, shoveled. LEVINE: Could you describe what your sleigh looked like? GILLICK: My sleigh was red. I had a red sleigh. My brother made it for me. Yeah. It was very nice. I laid on my whole body on it and my sister would sit on top of me sometimes. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: Now, you had, when you were in Sweden it was just you and your sister Olga and your parents? GILLICK: And two brothers, Harry and Gunner. Both are deceased, and Harry later on came over to America but Gunner stayed with his family, and he was ninety-two when he died a year ago. LEVINE: Okay. So which brother made you your red sleigh? GILLICK: Gunner, Gunner. LEVINE: He was the oldest? GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: And what was your mother's name? GILLICK: Anna Nilson, was her maiden name, Anna Charlotte Nilson. LEVINE: And N-I-L-S-E-N? GILLICK: S-O-N. LEVINE: S-O-N. ( a dog is heard barking on the tape ) Uh, wait. We'll pause here. GILLICK: Could you shut it off? ( referring to the tape recorder ) I'll take . . . ( break in tape ) LEVINE: Okay. We're resuming now. Bowser, the fattest dog in the world, has just come in. ( they laugh ) We may hear a panting from time to time. ( they laugh ) Okay. So Gunner made you the red sleigh. GILLICK: Yes, yes. And Harry and my sister had made me a doll house. LEVINE: Oh. Can you describe that? GILLICK: Well, inside it was made out of cartons, you know, orange boxes, and I, we didn't, we never had any oranges. We picked them up at the dump, the boxes, you know, and brought them home, and they made me a doll house and taped it inside, put curtains on the windows, cute little furniture. Everything was made with things that we had in the house. LEVINE: And did the dollhouse look like your house? GILLICK: No, no. It looked just like a small, tiny little bit of a red cottage. It was very pretty. LEVINE: And your brothers both made that for you? GILLICK: No. My sister and Harry, my brother Harry and my sister. That was their project, while Gunner made the sleigh. He had bought an old sleigh, you know, with the slides, you know, what do you call it? You know, the runners that they run on. He bought an old sleigh, but made a new top and, you know, it was red and had my name on it. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Well, it sounds like you were a very close family. GILLICK: Yes, we were. Poverty-stricken but, you know, a respectful and loving family. You know, we all obeyed Papa. LEVINE: Papa was strict? GILLICK: Oh, yes. LEVINE: Can you remember any of the ways in which he was strict? GILLICK: Well, I sneaked out with a girl of eighteen at night to that hill where you go sleigh riding. ( she coughs ) Excuse me. And never told him. And, of course, we were there a couple of hours, and it was the first time he ever spanked me with a piece of wood. LEVINE: And did you all have chores to do around the house? GILLICK: Well, yes, we did. My brothers worked, and my father was like a farmer. He rented ground and, you know, planted on it and, you know, like you borrow a garden to work it for your own good and we had vegetables and fruit and flowers. And it was hard work, hard work for my mother. She worked very hard out in the fields. LEVINE: Now, did your father also sell what he grew? GILLICK: Oh, yes. Oh, sure. That's how he made his living. LEVINE: What were his major crops? GILLICK: Well, we had vegetables. We had, oh, carrots and rhubarb. I can see the fields in front of me, you know. We had beautiful strawberries, all kinds of berries on the bushes. And, of course, the most magnificent pears you ever tasted in your life. And they were called, in Swedish, swan neck. That means that they were made like a swan's neck, long and graceful, but the most juiciest, the most delicious pears. LEVINE: How do you spell that, swarnick? GILLICK: I don't know what they call, what the real name for it was, you know? LEVINE: Do you know how to spell it? GILLICK: Swan neck pears. That's their shape. You know, long and round, and then like the long neck. And I used to bring cherries. Oh, we had the most magnificent cherry trees. One especially was very, very expensive, and we were never allowed to eat it, but when cherry picking time came, my father would say to me, "Bring home five or six kids from school. I'll pay them to pick cherries." And we'll say that maybe there were fifteen cherry trees. It was quite an orchard that we had. But my father would say, "You kids go up in the trees, and you can eat as much as you want, but this tree I want everybody to whistle, because those are the expensive cherries. They are different from the others." He said, "No eating up there. Everybody whistle and keep their mouth away." ( they laugh ) You know. Otherwise they could eat on the other trees. LEVINE: Did you ever taste one, a cherry from that tree? GILLICK: Oh, of course. Like Adam and Eve, of course I tasted them. Forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: So then where would your father send those very special cherries? GILLICK: Well, no, he took them to market. He went to market every Saturday, into town. And you laid out your wears on tables, and oh, they sold. They were very popular, you know, in demand. LEVINE: Did you ever go to market with your father? GILLICK: Oh, sure. LEVINE: Describe what you would do on market day? GILLICK: Well, on market day my brother Harry, we were the youngest, you know, and I, we'd only think about going to the bakery, and our mother gave us a penny to go in there and ask for crumbs, you know, what they have left over from broken cookies. Oh, and for a penny you could get a bag from all these delicious-tasting cookies. Who cared whether they were in small bits or not? They tasted delicious. So we looked forward to that, you know. And then we played with other children there and, you know, that came with the farmers, and it was fun. It was fun. LEVINE: Did you help your father? GILLICK: No. Weeding, we were helping. Oh, terrible, weeding, that's what we helped home. Oh, on your knees and weed. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: And your mother, she worked in the fields as well? GILLICK: Oh, yes, yes. She planted potatoes, and we would stick the potatoes in the ground and she made the groove, you know, what they call. Yes, she worked very hard. She died very young, and my father lived to be quite old. He was twenty years older than her, and she was his second wife, and I was the eleventh child. But she only bore, you know, the second wife only bore my brothers and my sister and I. The first wife had a lot of children and a lot of miscarriages. LEVINE: Did your mother have miscarriages as well? GILLICK: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I know I took all the strength out of her, being her last child. She was only forty-nine when she passed away. LEVINE: Well, how old was she when you were born? GILLICK: Well, forty-nine. ( the dogs barks ) I was ten years old when she died. I don't know what's the matter. Shush. ( the dog barks ) ( break in tape ) LEVINE: So you were, she died while you were in Sweden. GILLICK: Oh, yes. She died, and my sister was a domestic and working up in Stockholm and had a very nice position. She came home to care for my mother, who got tuberculosis. And my mother died home. She was in bed about a year. She died when I was ten, and my father lived to be eighty-five, almost eighty-six, a few weeks before it. And, you know, I went to, I left Sweden with my sister Olga, and my father and two brothers stayed, you know, by themselves. And in America I had two step-sisters, and one of them came over from Sweden to get us, and, Sandra, her name was, and she took us back with her, and she was a U.S. citizen, so she never had to go to Ellis Island. LEVINE: I see. GILLICK: She just went right off and went home. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Well, let's, before we talk about America, let's talk a little bit more about . . . GILLICK: Sweden? LEVINE: Sweden, yeah. Do you remember any foods that your mother cooked? GILLICK: Rabbit. We had lots of rabbit. LEVINE: Did you raise rabbits? GILLICK: Yes. ( she laughs ) And chicken. I was never like, I could never recall eating chicken, and I never tasted anything like it until I was over here. They must have cooked it a different way. LEVINE: Do you remember any of the ways that she cooked things, your mother? GILLICK: No, not really. I wasn't interested, you know, at that time. Later on I would have loved to. LEVINE: Do you remember your house? Could you describe where you lived in Sweden? GILLICK: Oh, it was a very small house. It had only two bedrooms. My brothers had one of them, and another one my sister and, my father and my mother had the other one, and my sister and I slept in the bed, you know, like a day bed, in the, what we called the parlor. And it was quite crowded and, of course, there was no running water, and no electricity, no hygiene. It was all rough. LEVINE: Do you remember, could you describe the parlor? GILLICK: The what? LEVINE: The parlor? GILLICK: Oh, yes. It had a round table and four chairs, and a big family bible on it that my father read. And every Sunday we all had to sit down in there and, you know, listen. LEVINE: Would you go to church as well? GILLICK: No. I went to Sunday school, Salvation Army Sunday school. Everybody went to it. You know, I have never heard of Catholics, and I never heard of denominations like Baptists or anything. All I knew is this, what was really the Lutheran. The whole city must have been Lutheran because I don't remember ever hearing anybody else, you know. But we had a big cathedral in the city, right in the market where we go on Saturday. Beautiful, big, and on Christmas Eve, we get our presents Christmas Eve, and get up at six o'clock the next morning, Christmas Day, and get in the sleigh and the horse, you know, would be all decked out for Christmas. And we'd drive into, well, you would call it Mass at six o'clock in the morning, beautiful. And I can still feel when they played that big organ who it quivered through the whole cathedral and your body, when the first chords that they played, you know. It was thrilling, to ride in the snow, covers up to here, you know. ( she gestures ) LEVINE: The whole family would be on a big horse-driven sleigh? GILLICK: Yes, uh-huh. My father and my mother and my biggest brother would be up front, and the other, Olga and us, we were in the back. And it was fun, it was nice. It made you feel good. LEVINE: What would happen Christmas Eve? GILLICK: Christmas Eve was celebrated, I guess, all over the country, more than Christmas Day. Christmas Eve was wonderful. Poor as we were, we had plenty of food, and the main food was a big, a piglet, a pig, and it was my job to put the apple in his mouth and the parsley in his ears, to decorate him to eat. And I put out for the, you know, they don't believe in Santa Claus. It's gnomes, you know, that we were brought up to believe, you know, and that they come. And so I used to put out a dish of milk, rice, something like rice pudding out on the stoop, and, you know, after a while, for somebody there in the family went and took it away. They emptied it, but I'd go out. I was like, "He was here and he ate it!" ( she coughs ) So that was a wonderful belief. But when I came to America I loved their Santa Claus much more. LEVINE: Now, was it the gnome who supposedly brought the presents? GILLICK: Well, no, not really. Just good luck to your house. And then, of course, we had a Christmas tree, but we had real candles on it, and all the little fruits are made of marzipan, and all kinds of cut out papers we learned from school, you know, shimmering paper, like silver or gold. It was all very plain, but it was beautiful when it was lit up with the real candles LEVINE: Did the whole family decorate the tree? GILLICK: Well, yes. Mostly it was put up for us, you know, for the children, that they were. Everybody added something to it, you know. It was nice. And the packages, I can still, you know, here we spend so much money on wrapping and ribbons and flowers, you know, decorations. We had brown paper, and we had sealed with like a red wax that you heat, and you drop it to where you want it sealed and, you know, and I could still smell it. It was the most wonderful smell, and you got those packages, and everybody's package looked the same except you wrote in longhand on it whose was what. It was very plain, but very nice. LEVINE: And can you remember any gifts, the kinds of gifts that you received, or gave? GILLICK: Well, Parchesi game, I know we got. That was a joint gift. We had a lot of fun with that. And I would get, you know, a rubber boots. You know, you'd get things that were good. Nothing really, you don't get a lot of toys. You get candy to eat, you know, and good food but usually clothing, like a scarf or mittens, or whatever you needed, you know. Like on December 9th was my name's day. LEVINE: Oh, tell me about that. GILLICK: Anna, Anna. My middle name was Anna, and they had name's day. And there I woke up, and I have a package in bed. And guess what it was? It would be an orange, and that was for me like gold. We never got that, an orange. And it was delicious. And, I don't know, maybe a pair of cheap beads, you know, or something like that. I don't remember. I just looked forward to that orange. LEVINE: You mean, every name day, every year? GILLICK: Yeah. LEVINE: You would get that? GILLICK: Yeah. LEVINE: Now, your name day, what day was that? GILLICK: December 9th. LEVINE: Uh-huh. GILLICK: And it was my mother's name and my name, you know, Anna. So we had, you know, two celebrations. LEVINE: And did you celebrate the name day in any other way besides the orange? GILLICK: No, just the presents, you know, whatever it was. And knowing it, you know. LEVINE: Now, was December 9th, in other words, Anna was what, a saint, or just the name? GILLICK: Just the name, I guess. I don't think, is there a St. Anne? I don't know. You know, I never dwelled on that subject to see. LEVINE: But each name had a day associated with it. GILLICK: Uh-huh, yes. LEVINE: Did your brothers have name days? GILLICK: I don't think so. I don't think so. I never remember. I don't think they did. I just remember mother's and mine, and I remember May 1st. That's another big thing. ( an airplane can be heard in the background ) LEVINE: What was that? GILLICK: We had marching, you know, like patriotic things. You march and, you know, with the children through the town, and you carry the flag and you sing. And you end up at a big castle, and the courtyard of the castle would be the place where we ended up the meeting, and they would pray and we would sing, and then we'd play and have fun, you know. And in the winter, around this castle, I was taught how to ice skate on the ice around the castle. And at night my sister would take me, and they had bonfires on the ice. Oh, it was beautiful! And people were, from Kalmar, would ride over to the island where people lived with a horse and buggy, you know, on the ice, and regular traffic there at night, you know. It was real nice. That was exciting. LEVINE: Do you remember any of the songs that . . . GILLICK: Oh, I have schoolbooks with me, the same books that I used in school I have here, you know, with me, that I often take out and sing through the songs that we used to sing in school. LEVINE: Can you remember, can you sing a few bars of anything you remember from childhood? It doesn't matter if it sounds . . . GILLICK: Well, I don't know the words, but I'll look it in the book, you know. LEVINE: Well, maybe when we finish. GILLICK: Yes, okay, sure. LEVINE: It would be nice to have that on the tape. GILLICK: Sure. LEVINE: Great. Okay. Um, let's see. So, how, when did you start school in Sweden? What age were you? GILLICK: Oh, it must have been, I had graduated, you know, before I left for America. I graduated the public school. I guess you start between six and seven. LEVINE: And did everyone go? GILLICK: Yes. What do you mean? At their age? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Like my brothers didn't have to go any more. You know, they had graduated. They didn't go into like anything like high school or college, you know. We couldn't afford that. They worked right after they finished school. LEVINE: What did your brothers do right after they finished? GILLICK: Well, it was, nearby there was a marble factory. It wasn't really a factory. It was a big outdoor thing. They sold gravestones and all different things in marble, and one brother worked there, and another one sewed newspapers on the train. He traveled on the train and sold newspapers back and forth, from certain cities, you know. They all did something. And Olga, of course, had gone to Stockholm for this domestic job. That was very, very good for her, you know. She had a wonderful lady that she worked for. But she had to come home to take care of my mother. When my mother was dying, she came home for that one year. Olga was cooking and doing all the work. LEVINE: Well, did you ever go to Stockholm? GILLICK: Once we had to go there. In order to leave the country, you had to go up to Stockholm and get certain papers. That was the only time. And I was scared to death. I had never seen a trolley. I had never seen an automobile. All I had seen was the motorcycle. My landlord's son had a motorcycle. And, of course, it was a quick visit, and they left me with the lady where we were staying overnight and my two sisters, the one that came from America to get us and Olga, they went out on the town one night, and I stayed up and stayed home. ( they laugh ) So I didn't see much of it, you know. LEVINE: Well, is there anything else about your little town that you recall? Did you have other relatives there? GILLICK: Oh, yes. My mother's brother was a mailman. Another relative had the big park where they had dancing and theater entertainment. They were caretakers there. They lived right on, in the park, you know. Aunt Ida and Uncle Peter, and they were wonderful people. And when the summer came on and they had the May festivals and all different kinds of festivals in the park, I would go there, you know, and eat my heart out. They had waffles made like hearts. I couldn't get enough of them. Oh, everybody bought me one. ( she laughs ) You know, you were grateful for so little when you were poor, you know. You don't think beyond other things, you know. You don't wonder how other people live. You just know that you live and the best that they, you know, possible. LEVINE: Did you feel you were poor at the time? GILLICK: Yes, yes, oh, yes. I used to hate the packages we got from America. It would be high pointed high shoes for me to wear, and the children in school laughed at me. Oh, I used to cry, I used to cry all the way to school. And do anything to stub the toe and ruin it, you know, bump it into everything I could. LEVINE: What would be the difference between the high pointed shoes and what you had? GILLICK: Well, they didn't have it, you know. You know, they were expensive shoes, I guess, you know, belonged to somebody. And clothing, but the only thing that fitted me, the dresses fitted my sister, but the shoes was the only thing that fitted me, and I hated them. LEVINE: Do you, what did you usually wear for shoes? GILLICK: Well, it was like brogue, nothing fancy. I call them brogue, the heavy-made shoes, like a man's shoe, with thick soles, you know. And good leather, I mean, you know. But in the wintertime we wore boots. I used to put newspapers in my boots and stockings to keep them warm, you know, so you wouldn't get cold. And that's it. LEVINE: Do you remember what other, how else you dressed? Anything about your clothing? GILLICK: No. I really don't recall what kind of clothes I had, except when my mother passed away I had to wear black. I had a black pinafore, like, I wore over a dress, and a black hat that had black crepe on it. And my brother took me to the park one night to see fireworks and some kind of celebration, and it poured. Oh, a terrible rainstorm came up. And the black ran all over my face from the hat. And I was afraid of the thunder. ( an airplane passes overhead ) I mean, those things, you know, it wasn't funny, and sad, some of them. You know, but I remember when we buried my mother. You walked behind the hearse. The coffin is pulled by horse and carriage, you know, and you walked behind, and along was our cat. He was crazy about my mother. That cat never left. Went to the cemetery, sat while she was buried, the burial took place, didn't come home with us, but later on came home during the night, you know. And that was the saddest day of my life, but it was also a childish anticipation to see all that candy that was marked and put in like a paper covering and with her name, my mother's name, and death and birth, you know, like you do, and had a piece of candy at the end of it, and I was thrilled to hand them out to my friends, you know. LEVINE: Was that typical to have that, the candy? GILLICK: It's in the thing, you know, like, oh, you make like a little pouch and the candy's at the bottom, and at the top it says the name of the person who died, you know. I still have an old copy of it someplace. LEVINE: Oh. And so you, and so you would be, you were the person who . . . GILLICK: I gave it to my friend. I shouldn't have, you know, it wasn't meant to "handed out" like, it was to people that came and paid their respects or something, but I took some and gave my friends, because it was candy. LEVINE: So that was typical of a funeral in Sweden at that time? GILLICK: Yes. She was laid out at home in one of our stalls that my father had for fruit, like, it was like a little, a big bin, and we decorated with flowers and leaves, and that's where the casket laid, was laid out until it was burying time. LEVINE: Where was this? GILLICK: Right at home, right next to our house, in the garden, you know, where we had all the fruit and vegetables, and all these bins. And the cat slept on top of the coffin the whole time, never came in to eat. LEVINE: What was the cat's name? GILLICK: Murre, M-U-R-R-E. Murre. And when I came to America, my father would dip Murre's hand on an ink pad and stamp it on the paper, and he said, "Here he tells you he loves you." And this is your, ( she laughs ) you know. LEVINE: Let's see. Were there any other kinds of customs that you recall from Sweden that were not the same after you came here? GILLICK: Oh, well, we had a bathhouse. Everybody bathed in the same. One family, and me and the kids, we bathed in the same water, because we had nothing. It had to be carried by hand, you know, the pails, to fill the big, and every family has a date to go to it, you know. LEVINE: It was a separate structure in the town? GILLICK: That's right. Right in the, among the houses, you know. Besides our little house, there was, well, three other houses, and then the landlord's big house. It had a second floor. My goodness, that seems to high to me. ( she laughs ) And they had this bathhouse and you really had to, you know, the women scrubbed their clothes there and had, you know, access to a big water, well, you carry pails and pails and pails of water to fill for bathing. And that only took place once a week. No, you know, we had, everyone had, of course, outdoors privies, you know. No sanitation whatsoever. LEVINE: So would your mother do the laundry in the bathhouse? GILLICK: Yes, yes. LEVINE: So she would take her laundry to that place? GILLICK: Yes. And then in town, not too far away from home, like she could walk, they had like a, I don't know if it was like a canal or a lake, but they had what they call wash houses, and the women went down there and dipped their clothes in that water, you know, and wash it and rinse it. Certain things are just, bed sheets and things. We did big things there. So that, you know, there was no, nothing easy for the woman that lived there, for my mother, you know. There was nothing easy. Everything was hard to do. END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE LEVINE: Where did, where did your mother and other women in the town dry their clothes? GILLICK: On lines. Each had, you know, like some people have here, clotheslines. LEVINE: And that would be in your backyard, or where would it . . . GILLICK: Well, yeah. There was a big lot that was next to our garden, our, the little farm that we have was a big lot, and they had a lot of people, you know, hung their clothes there. You put up your own rope, and your own spot, and that was yours forever, you know. LEVINE: Did your mother make any of your clothing? GILLICK: No. LEVINE: Where did you get it? GILLICK: Well, it was second-hand clothing. In the city there was the only Jewish person I had ever known or seen in Sweden, and he had a pushcart, and he went through and sold different things. And he would have, well, maybe she did make them, I don't know. But there were clothes there on the thing that they brought for me that fitted me, you know, that he had on his wagon. LEVINE: Was this the same town where your father went to sell, to the market? GILLICK: Kalmar, yes. Kalmar. LEVINE: K-A-L . . . GILLICK: M-A-R. A beautiful city. LEVINE: And there was just one Jewish person that you ever knew. GILLICK: Yes. And he was, he was very popular with all the things that he had, you know. And he had a daughter with the same name as me, Sonya. Sonya, they call it in Swedish, Sonya. LEVINE: Sonya. And did he sell other things besides clothing? GILLICK: Oh, yes. He had medicines and things, all different things, housewares. A regular little store in back of a wagon, you know, many things. Somebody, there was always something for somebody there. He always made a sale. LEVINE: And how about medicine or doctors or medical care? GILLICK: Well, no, I never knew any. We had a dentist that came to school and examined everybody, the children's teeth. And he gave each one a toothbrush. I came home. I was so thrilled with that toothbrush. You have no idea. "Look what I've got!" And my father says, "Let me see that." Oh, he picked it up and he said, "Oh," he said, "that's wonderful to clean my boots with." And he spit on it and he rubbed it on his boot. LEVINE: How did you feel? GILLICK: I cried for days. I hated him. I was so mad at him. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: What kind of a temperament did your mother have? GILLICK: Have a what? LEVINE: What kind of temperament? GILLICK: Oh, mild. Mild as a lamb. Strong-willed, but very mild, you know. She could express herself and flare up like everybody else, but otherwise she was just loving and caring all the time. She wanted everybody to be happy and everybody to be well, and she was a good mother, a good mother. LEVINE: Were you closest to any particular family member? GILLICK: Well, being my mother was ill from the time I was ten years old, you know, my father, I was the apple of my father's eye, just to make a quote. And, of course, my brothers hated him because he took my part no matter what happened, you know, and I just, I wasn't the best sister. I'd get them in trouble and squeal on them, you know. "Oh, Papa, Harry did this," or, "Gunner did this," you know. "Oh," and I said, "you wait till I get a hold of you." You know. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: What, could you describe yourself as, you know, ten, eleven, twelve years old? GILLICK: Yes, I guess, I don't know how I looked. I have no idea how I looked. I mean, I was always chubby, I know that. And I played with a little porcelain doll I had, and otherwise the cat was my baby. I'd doll him up in a bonnet and some clothes and make him lay on his back in this homemade little carriage I had and he would scratch and claw to get out, you know, and I'd spank him. ( she laughs ) My mother says, "Oh, you and Murre get along so well." I said, "Mama, he's tied down. Otherwise he wouldn't be in there." LEVINE: What was the doll like? Can you describe . . . GILLICK: Oh, a little porcelain thing with a painted face. I remember the day I dropped it because I was fighting with my brother Harry, and I dropped the doll and it broke in five different pieces, and I had those pieces, some were trying to make them stick together. I made flour and water paste, you know, but it was no good. That was the only doll I ever remember having. Yeah. We really didn't have too much to play with, but you made out, you went on picnics, and you went swimming. And you didn't, nobody wore bathing suits. The women had their own place to go, and they'd be in a sheet, and walk down to the water and drop the sheet and go in the water. Us kids ran around like nymphs, you know, never thought anything about being naked when you're, when you're girls, you know. It's just, I can see and feel the water. It's nice to be without, I have experienced here going into a pool at night and taking off my bathing suit, and it reminds me just how it felt, you know. It's a great difference. Yes. That was fun. We had sandwiches with us, you know. And everybody would be, a beautiful river, you know, you'd be outside all day long. LEVINE: What would you be swimming in? A pond, or . . . GILLICK: I really don't know. It was quite large. You know, we would hear, being it was all women where I went, across where we were was an island, and that's where the men were. And I figured out without any trouble that they met some of the women in the middle of the water. ( they laugh ) They did. I know they did. There were squeals and, you know, you could tell. LEVINE: Well, now, what was the weather like when you were, was there, it was a long winter? GILLICK: Oh, yes. It was long winters and a tough spring, I mean, very damp and wet and cold springs. Being my father was a farmer or a gardener, whatever you call it, you know, he had to have good weather to replant things, you know. But they celebrated, like, they had May fests that I liked, and all the trees would be in bloom with all different things, and you danced around a pole. And those that had, came to entertain would be, they had special costumes for the counties that they came from, you know. And, oh, I used to say, "Ooh, I'd love to have one of those outfits." You know. It was so pretty. But they were paid entertainers, you know, that came. That was nice. There was always something of interest, you know. But mostly we were in early at night. We were never allowed out, you know, when it was real dark, because there were no street lamps or anything. And I just never thought beyond our family that it was so different, you know. When I came here to America, I was just overwhelmed. I never wanted to leave, never. LEVINE: Well, tell me. Did you have, like, boyfriends at this age? GILLICK: Oh, I had a boyfriend, yes. The richest boy in town. You know, his father owned a men's clothing store, and that was something big. But he went to a private school. And, you know, my girlfriend and I would, I'd go to my girlfriend's house to be nearer his house, and he'd come over, you know. And we'd talk, and he'd walk me home. Nothing physical really, you know. He was down at the dock when I left Kalmar to go to Stockholm. He was down there to wish me goodbye, and he brought me a flower. LEVINE: What were, you mentioned your father grew flowers as well. GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: What kinds of flowers did he grow? GILLICK: All kinds of, well, we had, these are the Easter . . . LEVINE: Daffodils. GILLICK: I never saw irises. Maybe once, but daffodils I knew. Then there's another flower that comes after Easter, and they call an Easter flower. Jonquils, I think they're called. And daisies, pansies, roses. My father, Thornblom, means "wild rose." And my father had a French name, and they changed it for people, and that's why there's so many Johnson, Peterson. They changed their names to fit their, how they make their living. So my father picked Thornblom. That was his favorite flower. And his French name was Bovange, B-O-V-A-N-G-E. Bovange. And, you know, he was never called that. It was Thornblom all the time. Thornblom. It had a thing over, you know, Thornblom. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Well, now, was your father French? GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: Had he actually come from France? GILLICK: Well, no. He had lived most of his part in Germany, because there was a Revolution in France, and people with, I guess he came from a pretty good family. People with, middle class people, they were slaughtered in the market, and to get away from children, they sent my brother, Gunner and Harry, to Germany, to a friend of my father's who was a miller. He had, you know, made flour. And the boys stayed there until, well, they both ran away because the man was so mean to them. LEVINE: Now, this is, these are your brothers? GILLICK: Yeah. LEVINE: Your father sent to Germany? GILLICK: No. My father was sent to Germany. LEVINE: Oh, I see. His mother and father were in France. GILLICK: Yeah, in France, yes. LEVINE: And they sent him and his brother whose, and their, he and his brothers' names were the same as your brothers' names? GILLICK: No, no. That was a mistake. He had only one son, but I don't know how often my father's parents would send money and clothing for him. It was never given to him. He put it on his son, and my father never saw the money. So he ran away when he was about fifteen. LEVINE: How long had he been in Germany with this miller? GILLICK: Oh, he had been there a long time, at the miller's, yeah. LEVINE: Your brother was there several years? GILLICK: Oh, yes. One was there longer than the other. One ran out and went to see, ran away, you know, to get out of there. And another one stayed a little bit later but ran away and joined a landscaping school that they had. He worked there and got his, you know, learned how to do landscaping. LEVINE: And then your father, he . . . GILLICK: My father came to Sweden on, I don't know what was the reason, but he met my mother there. LEVINE: Well, your father and his brothers . . . GILLICK: Yeah? LEVINE: Couldn't go back to France. GILLICK: No. And they separated, and they never saw each other until I guess forty years later when my mother came home. She said to my father, "Thornblom, I just met a lady at the dock, and there's a captain on the ship that has your name, Bovange." And it was my father's brother, and they were reunited that way. And she said, "I made it that tomorrow you have to come with me to this woman's house, and she's going to have that captain there." Because while he was in port, he roomed with her, you know. She had rooms for sailors, and she says, "You'll meet him." And I remember my father came home with a green banana and gave me. ( she laughs ) I didn't know what it was. Ooh, I thought it was awful. But I learned to eat them when I came to America. As long as there was ice cream and bananas, I was staying. LEVINE: Well, now, your father's brother's name, the one that was on the ship? Do you remember? GILLICK: Yes. ( she sighs ) ( she whispers ) Was it Fred? No, I only know the Bovange. I don't know what his, my father's name was Carl Frederick. I don't know what his brother was. I forget what his name was. LEVINE: So it's, spell it again. B-O-U . . . GILLICK: B-O-V-A-N-G-E. Bovange. Something like that, he pronounced it. But my father, of course, learned fluid, not fluid . . . LEVINE: Fluent. GILLICK: German, you know, to speak. And he spoke French too but, I mean, he was in Germany, and he did all his, most of his talking in German, and then he came to Sweden, of course, and he learned that. So he was not dopey. He was a smart man. You know, he knew three languages. LEVINE: Well, he came to America, too? GILLICK: No. LEVINE: No, he never came. GILLICK: No, no, no. LEVINE: Okay. Well, how did, how was it decided that you would come to America? GILLICK: Well, my mother passed away, and my sister Sandra had really come over to get my older sister Olga. She never, you know, and when she saw that, she says, "I can't leave you alone with your father and two brothers." You know, a kid of eleven, or whatever it was at that time. And that's why she sent for money from her husband to send more money so she could take me. LEVINE: And Sandra was one of the children of your father's first marriage? GILLICK: First marriage, yeah. And Adele is the one I came to in the United States. I had never seen until the day at Ellis Island when we stood on the pilot boat and saw them up on the pier, and I saw her, and I said, "I don't like you." She was, Sandra told me, "You wait till you get to Adele. She's a very, very strict person. You'll tow the mark. None of your foolishness. Whatever she says goes." And believe me, she scared me into doing that, because when I saw her she has glasses that are pinched onto your nose, and her hair was up in a little bun on the top of her head. And she looked so strict! So I said, "I don't want to go with you." And she said to me, "Well, I don't want you either." But her husband was at her side, and he says, "Sonya, you're coming home with us, and you're going to love it." ( she laughs ) So I loved him from the start. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Okay. So, let's see. Sonya, uh, Sandra came over. GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: And she was meaning to simply take Olga. GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: Now, why was she going to bring Olga over? GILLICK: Well, Olga was very independent, and she said, "I've been housekeeper for my father for over a year and I can't stand it. If you don't take me, I'm going to run away anyway. "I'm going back to my Stockholm and try and get a job up there." She said, "But I'm not going to stay with them." LEVINE: So they had been corresponding? GILLICK: Yes, oh, yes. LEVINE: So did you know Sandra? Did you know Sandra from before she went to America? GILLICK: No, never seen her. LEVINE: But Olga . . . GILLICK: But she had seen me. She had seen me. She had been, you know, she was pregnant at the same time as my mother was with her son, so she had seen me. LEVINE: And she knew Olga. GILLICK: Yeah, oh, yeah. Olga was like nine years older than me. LEVINE: Okay. So she came, and then she said, well, she was going to take you, too. GILLICK: Yes, yes. LEVINE: Then how long, did it take a long time for the arrangements to be made? GILLICK: No, no. Only a couple of weeks. LEVINE: And then you, you, Olga . . . GILLICK: And Sandra, went to Stockholm, and got the necessary papers, and then rode across country on a train to Goteborg, where the ship was. LEVINE: Well, before we talk about the ship, do you remember leaving? How did you feel about going? GILLICK: Oh, terrible. It was the saddest thing down at the pier, saying goodbyes, you know. It was tears like you never saw. And my father couldn't go. He wouldn't go. He said, "Say goodbye to me here." He says, "I don't want to go down there." LEVINE: Do you remember leaving your house? GILLICK: Oh, sure. I remember hugging my father and my brothers, you know. And my girlfriends, they have to see me off. And my friend, you know, the boyfriend. They were all down there. LEVINE: And . . . GILLICK: But, you know, it was sad in a way, but I was so excited. It was such a new thing to get on this boat to go up to Stockholm. To me that was adventure that I dreamed about, you know. And I didn't feel too bad. It was on the trip over here on the big boat that I got so homesick. LEVINE: I see. Do you remember anything that you packed to take with you? GILLICK: No. I did, my sister did all the packing. I took my schoolbooks. That's all I took. LEVINE: And do you remember why you took your schoolbooks? GILLICK: Oh, because I wanted them, that's all. I don't know. Because I loved them. There was songs in there and all, it was like, it belonged to me, nobody else, you know. LEVINE: Do you remember anything that Olga brought with her? GILLICK: No, I don't. LEVINE: Do you remember your luggage, what you carried? GILLICK: Burlap bags. One bag looked like a paper suitcase, it wasn't very strong, we had with us on Ellis Island. LEVINE: So you took a, when you left your house, what did you take? What transportation did you take? GILLICK: Oh, we walked down to the pier. LEVINE: Okay. GILLICK: Right across town. It was a long walk. There was no way to ride. LEVINE: So you walked to the pier, and then you took a boat . . . GILLICK: Up to Stockholm. LEVINE: Up to Stockholm. GILLICK: Going up the coast. LEVINE: And that was the first time . . . GILLICK: I was ever on a boat. LEVINE: And it was the first time in Stockholm? GILLICK: Yes, oh, sure. LEVINE: So would you remember anything that struck you about the boat or Stockholm or . . . GILLICK: Well, Stockholm, I told you, trolley cars, I never seen, and beautiful restaurants and window displays that I'd never seen. And where we were going, they had a toilet, and I had never sat on one. And in a bathroom, my sister had to hold my hand because I was scared. I thought I was going to go out with the water. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: And what were in the window displays? Do you remember? GILLICK: In the stores, I'd never seen mannequins. I'd never seen all the different fruits, although we had a lot of fruits and I was never without fruits when I was a youngster. I had never seen a lot of them, never seen a tomato. Of course, the only banana I'd never saw was the green one that I got, my father brought. And he said it has to turn, be yellow, you know, to get ripe to eat, so I put it in my bureau drawer. And my mother said, "Every night when I lay in bed I hear some gnawing. Some noise, there must be a mouse someplace, or a rat." And she saw a little mounds of grain by the leg of this dresser where I had my, and the mouse had gone in there and eat, bitten it into pieces. So that, it was black when I got rid of it. ( they laugh ) So it was strange, it's strange. I mean, that an orange could mean so much and be so different in taste. And a tomato, I thought you eat like an apple, and you dive into it and oh, boy, you're disappointed. I had to learn to eat tomatoes by sprinkling sugar on top, and then after that no longer sugar on it. I was used to it, you know. LEVINE: That was in the United States by then. GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: Okay. Then, from Stockholm how did you go? GILLICK: Well, then, you go on trains to Goteborg, right across the country, it's from one end to the other on the map, you know. And you came, and if the boat is there, whatever. I had nothing to do with it. You know, my older sisters took care of everything, our papers and stuff, and we got on the boat. LEVINE: And was that your first train ride? GILLICK: Uh-huh. LEVINE: Do you remember any impressions of that? GILLICK: Not really my first train ride, because for two summers my, when I was about eight I guess, before my mother became real sick, she had a friend that they owned a big farm, but it was quite a distance away, and if you traveled on a train, and it's the same train my brother was selling papers on. ( she laughs ) That's the first time, yeah. LEVINE: Okay. So then, when you got to Goteborg, did you have any examinations prior to leaving? GILLICK: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You were inoculated. Your hair had to be clean. You couldn't have any nits or bugs, and they were very particular. So now, they could look you all over. LEVINE: Where was this? GILLICK: Right where the ship was docked they had like a, like a doctor's office, you know, with nurses in there, and everybody was inspected. LEVINE: Was this just prior to getting aboard the ship? GILLICK: Uh-huh, yeah. LEVINE: Were people actually turned away? GILLICK: Oh, sure. If they had anything wrong with them, like a strange skin disease or if they had bugs in their hair they were turned away, I know. LEVINE: Okay. So let's see. Was it just you and Olga then? GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: At that point, getting aboard the ship. GILLICK: Yes, uh-huh. LEVINE: And Sandra. GILLICK: Yes. Oh, yeah, she, but she, you know, didn't go through any. She just showed her papers and being a citizen helped her, you know. But she was with us, and we were, she and I and Olga and two others girls were in a cabin, steerage, down where the machinery was. Sandra and I never left our berths, or went up to the dining room, until the last day. We were seasick the whole time. LEVINE: How long? GILLICK: Well, thirteen days. And we went through a terrific storm. They dashed in, the guys came, dashed in and nailed up the windows and, you know, and says, you know, "It's going to be rocky weather." Oh, boy, did that ship toss and turn. Hmm! LEVINE: And the name of the ship? GILLICK: Stockholm. And I went to, one day, my first day, I went to the dining room. But the whole sea, when we were going to get ready to, the last day they were going to have dinner on the ship there, I went there, and, oh, my goodness, it was so rocky, the dishes had little fences set up on the table so they couldn't fall on the floor, you know. Everything was rocking. I didn't enjoy eating, and I didn't keep it down very long either. I was dehydrated. My sister Olga never went near the cabin except to change clothes. She slept in a deck chair upstairs. She danced all night long. She ate all the fruits that the ship had, and she comes down in the dark and sticks something in my mouth. I said, "Ooh, it has hair on it!" It was a peach. Ooh! ( she laughs ) I had never heard of peaches. ( she laughs ) So rather frightening, you know, we were so mad at her, because she was feeling so good and having such a good time. And Sandra wouldn't change her watch. Now we're doing this in Sweden now, we're doing that, you know. She wished, she wanted to stay, even though she had a husband and a son in America, she wanted to stay. But Olga and I wanted to get away. LEVINE: Okay. Now, do you remember the ship coming into the New York Harbor? GILLICK: No, I don't remember that at all. But I remember when the ship first started, became, how do you say it? Still, without going . . . LEVINE: Put down anchor? GILLICK: Yeah, at Newfoundland they stopped, and it was something like, they sent in the mail to the shore or something, you know, to the mainland. And they had baskets somehow connected, and it's the first time I ever tasted ice cream. In these baskets they had slices of ice cream. Orange, chocolate and vanilla. Oh, you don't know, after being dehydrated, how good that tasted. Oh, my goodness! And being a child, I don't know how many grownups that I didn't even know bought me one, you know. I ate that day until, my sister says, "You're going to die before you get on shore in New York." But it, that was the remembrance. Oh, that alone. Bananas and that. That is, that's my country, that's for me. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Well, so, you didn't remember the Statue of Liberty from aboard ship? GILLICK: Oh, yes. I remember that. We were going, you know, to Ellis Island, you know. You practically get up there, and it was beautiful. You know, I call it the green lady. In the sunshine she looked green, you know, pretty. But, you know, you're young, you're twelve years old, and what sticks in your mind is not always the things that were the best, you know. And your interests were, well, it was so great to know that you were going to come to a new life. You didn't look past anything. You just took what each day brought, you know. LEVINE: Do you remember your initial impressions of Ellis Island, when you first got there? GILLICK: Well, I have a good description of it here on the paper. LEVINE: Can you say it? GILLICK: Oh, sure, I could say it. ( paper rustling is heard on the tape ) I landed on Ellis Island in August, 1921. Of course, hundreds of immigrants were there, all talking different languages. And then there's the part here that you may not want me to include, about what happened about the lunch at Ellis Island. LEVINE: Sure, go ahead. GILLICK: Well, you know, we couldn't talk English, Olga and I. We didn't have Sandra with us there. But in all different languages we called out, so we got the idea that it was eating time, lunch. So Olga said to me, "You go, and I'll mind our bags, you know." Well, I went into this great big room, and there were lines of people. Oh, there were hundreds of people lined up. And I got as far as I could inside the door, and I saw down, they had these big, long tables, and men and women were serving big pieces or bread, and then each one had been given a bowl, and they filled it with red stuff. And I go back, and I told my sister, "Oh, they're serving bread and blood." I had never seen tomato soup in my life. Ooh, she says, "Please. We leave tonight and we go back on the boat." Because our "T" was the last, and alphabetically it was the second day we had to go there, you know. "Oh, we'll eat when we get to the boat," she said. We never went near it. LEVINE: ( she laughs ) Okay. I think we'll pause here because I want to turn the tape. GILLICK: Uh-huh. LEVINE: This is Janet Levine. This is the end of Tape One. I'm speaking with Sonya Gillick, and we'll be starting Tape Two. END OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE ONE, TAPE TWO LEVINE: We're going to resume now. This is Tape Two, and I'm speaking with Sonya Gillick, and we were talking about Ellis Island, and arriving there, and meeting your family. Okay. So, after you turned down the bread and blood . . . GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: Then what happened? GILLICK: Well, we sat there, and we were told we had to come back the next day, because they ran out, they went alphabetically, and we were "T," and we had to go back, so we went back and stayed on the ship, thank goodness. You know, I came back the following morning, and that's when I met my American family, you know. LEVINE: And you mentioned earlier that this was someone you'd been warned against. GILLICK: Oh, yes, yes, yes. I can fill in my own thing here. I was sure, it was the second day at Ellis Island. I was introduced to our family in America, Adele and her husband, a sweet-looking man, named Nils Brovall. This couple was sponsoring us. LEVINE: How do you spell Brovall? GILLICK: B-R-O-V-A-L-L. Brovall. Adele Brovall was not as pleasant as she was, as she was very strict-looking, with pinched-on-her-nose glasses. And it was at her house on 73rd Street in Brooklyn where I was to call home. That it was. I was welcome. Adele had a son ten years old, Elmer, a shy sort of lad whom I later on taught how to read English. He had a learning problem, and received many a cuff on the head by his mother. Elmer turned out to be an A-1 student once he was in evening high school and had a good job at Pratts. He married, but died at an early age of a hemorrhage of the brain. And (?) then there was a young man at Adele's house, son of Nils Brovall. He was a great person, and he played the organ and the piano, and he played for all the movie theaters before talkies came in. I should, I adored Kai, and he helped me a lot, and he was the person who brought me to school my very first day. He spoke Swedish fluently, and it was for him that I started piano lessons but found out it was not for me. LEVINE: What was his name? GILLICK: Kai, K-A-I. LEVINE: Okay. Tell me about the first day of school and Kai taking you. GILLICK: Oh, yes. Kai led, it was, first my sister. It was an Italian neighborhood. On the corner of our street was Our Lady of Guadeloupe, a big Catholic church, and in back of that, in the next street, was the public school, No. 112. And, of course, he took me into the principal's office and, you know, they expected me because the government was after children to, now, we got a notice without writing in that I got to go to school. So, of course, after he got all the learning, and gave all the information to the woman in the office, he had to leave me in the school yard with all these children. I didn't know, naturally, a word of English, except I had practiced my address in Sweden and nobody ever asked me, so I was so disappointed. Anyway, these children, like children are, you know, I was something to look at for them in the neighborhood was something to me. They talked so fast I thought I'd never learn that. But in no time at all we got to understand each of them, you know, and it was good. It was a little difficult in school. I had never done arithmetic that they had. I could do it the long way, but the way I was taught in school, and of course history was new to me, and most of all grammar, like (?) a sentence, you know, a verb and adjective. That was very difficult for me. But eventually I made it through school. ( she laughs ) LEVINE: Well, what grade were you put in? GILLICK: They put me in the fourth grade, and then they put me in the fifth grade, skipped over 4-B, and then I went from fifth grade to the B's, into seventh, and from the seventh I went up to full term, you know, 7-B. But I was the oldest one in the class, you know. LEVINE: Well, how was this school different from the school you had been in in Sweden? GILLICK: Well, the language, and the learning things were the difficulties, you know. It was the same. It was restrictions, you know, on behaving yourself. I don't know, I got along well with everybody. LEVINE: Were there a lot of immigrant children in the school? GILLICK: We were about, you mean in each class? Oh . . . LEVINE: Say, in your class, were there a lot of other children who had come from someplace . . . GILLICK: No, no. I had never, I'd never known anyone. I was the only one that, you know, came from my other country. LEVINE: Do you remember other things that struck you as different in America in those early days here? GILLICK: Yes. Well, little things were a lot of difference. Of course, it was, you know, the cars, and the running water, the electricity. I mean, it's so overwhelming that you can't swallow it all in one, you just wonder what's going to be next, you know, and you're full of surprises. Like Kai, my sister's stepson, took me on a Fifth Avenue bus, on the top of the bus, for a ride one day, and I was very quiet the whole time and he said, "What's the matter?" He said, "Don't you like the ride?" "Oh, yes," I said. This was in Swedish. "Yes," I said, "I enjoy it. But," I says, "why do they have to advertise it in almost every doorway?" He says, "What do you mean?" "Well," I says, "it says to let, to let, to let all over the place, do they have to advertise they got them." It means toilet in Swedish. So I . . . ( she laughs ) And, you know, things . . . LEVINE: What was your . . . GILLICK: Learning how to say "th." "Th" was very hard. I spit all over. It was just, you know, think, that, that, that's right. I used to envy him, Kai, when he talked to the other children in our house. My sister had a tenant, you know, in her house, and I said, "Oh, I'm so jealous of them," because he can talk to them, and we were looking at a rabbit they had there, and that reminded me of home in Sweden. And then he kept saying, "Don't do that. Don't do that." And I remember, he was saying this to the little boy that he, that was with us, and I remember that. That night I laid in bed, I said, "Don't do that, don't do that." You know, trying to practice. LEVINE: How did you say it naturally with a Swedish accent? How would you have said, "that?" GILLICK: Uh, (Swedish), "Don't do that," (Swedish). A lot of things, you know, not one certain thing. Yeah, "Don't do that," "don't do that." LEVINE: So is that how you practiced? GILLICK: Yeah. But I caught on real fast in reading, very good. Like I said, I was teaching my sister's ten-year-old son. He was so, oh, he hated school, he hated to learn, you know, and he did have a problem but, you know, you point to a word C-A-T, and when the guy says "dog," you know you're on a bad streak. ( she laughs ) You know, you got to really work on him. But he got through them. LEVINE: What happened to Olga? GILLICK: Olga became a maid as soon as she was over here through the church. We joined the Lutheran church with my sister that I lived with, you know. She was a staunch Lutheran in that church and, you know. And Olga joined there, and she got a job with two school teachers that wanted a housekeeper. One of them had a daughter, and she got a nice job there and she worked for them for years. LEVINE: Was she nearby? Did you see her? GILLICK: Oh, on her day off we saw her, you know. Everything was to go on trolley. That's the only way to come, either trolleys or walk. And, of course, she went to church, and she came over for dinner to Adele's house many a Sunday when she wasn't needed where she was working. Oh, yeah, we saw a lot of her. LEVINE: And how did Adele, how did it work out living with Adele? GILLICK: It was good. I was not an easy person to, uh, accept new things, you know, in a hurry. I was kind of slow on that part. But she was very good to me, very good, and forgave me for wetting the bed the first night I slept there. I was afraid to get up and go to the bathroom. LEVINE: How about Adele's husband? GILLICK: Oh, he was the sweetest man God ever put on this Earth. He was adorable. Of course, I got to learn to call him Pop. And as years grew by, I was even allowed to smoke in the house, after my sister had told me no, he said, "Let her go, let her," you know. ( she laughs ) But then I was going on seventeen, you know, real smart. I went to school, high school, only six months, and she said to me, "You're sixteen now. You've got to get a job and pay back your ticket." So I got a job through Kai. He had a girlfriend that managed an office, and I was in there as an office girl. I took care of the mail and all the little nitty-gritty things, and then learned how to type. When the girls went for lunch, I'd go to their typewriters. Although it wasn't the touch system, I could type just as fast as they could. And then I went to night school and took up shorthand, but I never finished it. It was just meeting people and getting out at night that attracted me to going to night school, because I already had my job, you know. And it was good. I worked there a long time. But with it all come something bad. It seems I had contracted a germ from my mother, a tubercular germ, and the change of climate brought out pimples on my ankles, little whiteheads, like. And one day I picked it, and it had a lot of pus in it. And, you know, you were apt to squeeze, the more I squeezed, the more came out. Well, in a month time I had both legs, I had ulcers on them. And they grew from the size of a pinhole to the size of a dime, and up to, as big as a nickel, and ate. It ate me, it didn't touch the bone. I had heavy legs, and the doctor said it saved me. It would have gone into the bone, you know, and that can't be replaced. But I went to Bellevue Clinic for three years and received gold injections. And all my teenage years my legs were wrapped up, both of them, and I would get up six in the morning and take care of my legs. I had to drop sulphur powder, because there was no penicillin in those days, into each sore and it was just like the nerve was exposed and all of that, and then wrap up all those wrappings it took and the stocking above all that. And by the time I started out to go to work, I had to take a trolley to get to the subway, my stockings were all wet. So I had a terrible teenage time with that, terrible. Terrible pain, terrible looking, and overhearing that, overhearing two doctors at Bellevue Clinic saying that I wouldn't have my legs until I'd be twenty-five, I'd be legless, you know, have to have them taken off. It sent me into hysterics so bad they had to give me a shot and call my sister in Brooklyn to come and get me. But luckily out of all the years, and I met my husband, even though I, you know, I told him about my legs, and he says, "Well, let's find somebody to cure it, you know." And he said, "It's not your legs I'm going to marry, it's you." You know. LEVINE: How did you meet your husband? GILLICK: Well, in an office. I worked in an office, and the office was run like a bank. It was Provident Loan. You could come in there and hock silver or diamonds or anything. It was run like a bank. And I was the one that wrote up all the tickets, and sitting in a cage, just like in a bank, with the money girl there. And he was an auditor. This one day he came to audit in our office, you know, all the packages in the vault, all the stuff, what they do, it takes hours. And I said to this girl Irene that was in the cash, you know, she was the cashier. "Oh, boy," I said, "I could go for him." She says, "You and twelve thousand others." But I said, "No." I said, "I'm going to have a date with him." And it turned out I did. LEVINE: How did he come to ask you out? GILLICK: Well, he was very nice to me when first he met me. When he was finished with her, counting all her cash, he'd stand behind me, you know, and talk, and try not to make it obvious to the other people in the office, you know, and we made a date, and I gave a party over Thanksgiving when my sister and her husband and her son went to Connecticut, I gave a party out in Brooklyn. And, of course, nobody, very few men, boys, had cars in those days, you know. And he said, "Well, I can." I said, "Can you bring some boys over, and I'll ask some girls over." And he said, "Yeah." He said, "This friend has a car, you know." He lived in Jersey City, and I lived in Brooklyn, so it wasn't very close. And we had a terrific party there. LEVINE: Now, you worked in Manhattan and lived in Brooklyn? GILLICK: Yeah, yeah. For seven years I traveled the subway. With my bandaged legs, on rainy days, when people had umbrellas and they'd bump me, oh, it used to be terrible, awful. And my sister said, she was, you know, she couldn't get over it, how I could stand it. She said, "Sonya," she said, "you've already had your Hell. I'm sure you'll go to Heaven." LEVINE: So what was it you liked about your husband? GILLICK: Pardon? LEVINE: What was it you liked about . . . GILLICK: Oh, his personality. He was an Irish descent guy, and he was all different from the Swedish. They seemed to dopey and slow to me, you know, out of it. He was exciting to be with. He was also, I didn't know that he was an alcoholic. He became an alcoholic through the years, you know. I guess I met him, and we went together for about three years before we got married. And, of course, my sister, Adele, was all against it, all against it. First it was his religion. I was taking lessons in the Catholic, you know, religion. And we had a rough time putting up with a lot of hate things that came out, you know. How could I, after singing for a choir for so many years of going to that church, you know, lay aside that so easily? ( an airplane can be heard ) Oh, it was all a debate, the whole thing. And I really did it to please his parents. He had wonderful parents, and very strict Catholics. And most of it I wanted to please them. So it wasn't entirely the right reason to change. LEVINE: Oh, so you changed religions? GILLICK: I did, yeah. LEVINE: And you became Catholic. GILLICK: Yeah. But I didn't stick with it very long. I couldn't take it. I couldn't learn it. I didn't believe it. I went to Confession, and my sister-in-law would be outside waiting for me. She said, "What are you doing in there? You've been in there twenty minutes." "Well," I said, "I had a lot to tell him." ( they laugh ) I said, "He had a lot to tell me, and I had more to tell him." And he said to me, "Why did you change when your other religion was so deep within you? We don't want Catholics that way," he said. Believe it? Which is true. I went back to my own religion after a while. But my children, I had promised to bring up my children Catholic, and they went to Catholic school and had very good grades. LEVINE: And what was your husband's name? GILLICK: Thomas Patrick Gillick. LEVINE: And your children's names? GILLICK: My first-born was Carol Anne. My second was, Carol Anne died at thirty-six years old of lung cancer. My second child was Patricia Mary. She lives, she's an RN. She lives down here now. She was in California Hospital in the emergency room for years. LEVINE: What is her, does she have a married name, a last name? GILLICK: Yeah, Todaro. Patty, she's divorced, but her marriage name was Todaro. LEVINE: T . . . GILLICK: T-O-D-A-R-O. LEVINE: And how about your first daughter who died? Was she married? GILLICK: No, no. And Linda, Kathleen, the one I live with now . . . LEVINE: Her married name? GILLICK: Uh, Goepfert. It's spelled G-O-E-P-F-E-R-T. And you pronounce it, leave out the O, and it's, most of the people call her "gopher," you know, or "go for it." ( she laughs ) And, you know, the people, they get it so mixed up, and it's pronounced Gepfert, without pronouncing the O. There's a picture of her family there on there . . . LEVINE: Oh, okay. GILLICK: Over there. And her husband and her kids. So I have a wonderful home here with them. LEVINE: And that's what you had, three daughters? GILLICK: Yes, three daughters. LEVINE: Do you have grandchildren? GILLICK: No. I'm going to have one in, my, Linda's son, Sean, his wife is pregnant, and she's going to have a baby in November, and the doctor told her . . . LEVINE: So that will be your great-grandson. GILLICK: Yes, yes. LEVINE: How many grandchildren do you have? GILLICK: Well, I have a lot, what does grandchildren mean? LEVINE: Let's see. Your children's children, right? GILLICK: Yeah. LEVINE: You, like Linda has children. GILLICK: Yes. But Patty has none, no children. Carol wasn't married. She never had. LEVINE: Okay. So Linda has how many children? GILLICK: Two boys. LEVINE: And their names? GILLICK: Sean and Don. LEVINE: All right. Well, let's see. Is there anything else, where did you, what did your husband do? GILLICK: My husband was an auditor, a CPA. He was a very clever man, very, very jolly. Drinking spoiled his chances of good jobs. LEVINE: So did, where did you live after you got married? GILLICK: After I got married I lived in Jersey City where he came from. And with my leg trouble I went to the Medical Center in Jersey City where I found a doctor that healed my leg. After all those years I'd been going to private doctors and to Bellevue, so. LEVINE: Well, what are you most proud of in your life? GILLICK: Well, I was proud of, because I was a good mother, and I was a good father, if you know what I mean, because I was separated three different times from my husband. And I, after my, after Linda got married I had no more responsibilities, you know, because Pat was married and Linda was married, and Carol was her own independent self in New York as a, you know, a boss of a big company. She was a secretary to one of the men. I got a job for a very wealthy lady in Palm Beach who wanted a housekeeper and a live-in maid, and I took it, and I was with her for twelve years. In the summer we went to Springfield, New Jersey where she had a home. In the winter we went to Palm Beach, where she had a beautiful apartment, and I lived in the lap of luxury. When she found out I could type, I became her secretary. I became her travel agent. She took me places that I never would have seen in my whole life. She loved me, she called me her gem, and we got along, although we had many misunderstandings, you know, sometimes, but for twelve years I was with her and I loved her dearly, and she died. She was a nice lady, a widow of a rich man. And the money they had, and how unhappy they all were. LEVINE: What do you think about your life, I mean, having started out in Sweden and coming to this country, how do you think, what does that mean to you? GILLICK: ( she sighs ) My days in Sweden to me are like a dream, like it was never real. It seems that I avoided all the unhappiness that I had in Sweden and took happiness over here, that's how much I changed. And when people say, my sister used to say to me, "Come home to Sweden with us this summer. I'll pay half of your fare." "Olga," I said, "you wouldn't get me on a boat to go to Sweden, after I laid for thirteen days and was seasick, I have never been near a boat since, and I wouldn't go." I said, "I'll fly." "Oh," she said, "you'll never get me on a plane." So I never went, and they went every three years, and I just corresponded with my brother, the one that was left over there, and he had three sons, and they learned English in school, and I could write some of my letters in English, and really tell them what my life was like, you know. And, like I said, Gunner lived to be ninety-two. He was a gardener and a landscaper just like his father, and he had gotten the poison of the spray on the flowers and the stuff he inhaled, and it affected his blood, so he was in the hospital, I think, every three months he had to go in for new blood. But he lived to be ninety-two. LEVINE: And how about your father? Do you remember . . . GILLICK: My father, I was sixteen over here, sixteen years old, when he died in Sweden. Yeah. All I did was write to him, you know. LEVINE: Well, how is this phase of your life? GILLICK: My life, besides my work with Mrs. McAuliffe, the wealthy lady . . . LEVINE: How do you spell her name? GILLICK: M-C, Capital A-U-L-I-F-F-E. And I came to Linda when I retired, on account of sickness. I had stomach ulcers. My doctor called it McAuliffe-itis. It was a very tough job to be with her and please her and take care of her parties and make hors d'oeuvres and all her, oh, it was a hard job, but I enjoyed it, though, most of the time. But she died, she was very sick. And I came with Linda, and these have been the best years of my whole life, bar none. Being with Linda, watching my grandsons grow up from little boys to the beautiful men that they are today, and one of them is married and going to be a daddy. And he said, "Nana, I'm having, we're having this baby just for you." He said, "We want to give you a great-grandchild." Great-great, yeah. Isn't it? LEVINE: Great. GILLICK: Yeah. So in this house it's loving, everything is loving and caring and respecting. It's what a house should be, and the wonderful husband my daughter has, she has a wonderful job herself. She works for a, she's a paralegal, and she loves it. And if it wasn't for me, she could never have kept that house, kept house and worked and go to college like she did and got her marks, you know. "I could never have done it without you, Mother." And I could never have done without her and her family. LEVINE: Well, I think maybe this is a good place to end. GILLICK: Yes. LEVINE: And I want to thank you very much. This has been most enjoyable. GILLICK: You've been a wonderful person yourself. LEVINE: Thank you. GILLICK: And thank you. LEVINE: And I want to say that I've been speaking with Sonya Thornblom Gillick. And I'm here at her, in her home in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and it's April 27th, one day before Sonya turns eighty-four years old. And I want to thank you very much. This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm signing off. ( break in tape ) Okay. We're resuming again, because we had in mind that Sonya would sing some of the songs. Now, Sonya has explained to me that you had a thyroid operation, so your voice is not as good as it once was. But these are songs that you knew from Sweden. GILLICK: Oh, sure. LEVINE: In fact, many times since that, in this country. GILLICK: Sure. LEVINE: Well, okay. I . . . GILLICK: All right now. ( she clears her throat, an airplane is heard in the background ) ( she sings in Swedish ) I can't do any more. Well, that was a song of a person that left Sweden and was thinking about his childhood home. ( sound of an airplane is heard in the background ) LEVINE: Unfortunately this airplane keeps . . . GILLICK: Oh, that's all right. It needed something. It wasn't good anyway, you know. LEVINE: I think it was, and I thank you very much.
