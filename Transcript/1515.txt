LEVINE:This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service. I’m here today in Inverness, Florida at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Schellig. Mr. Schellig came from Germany in 1926. He was eleven and a half years old. And he’s about to have his eightieth birthday. SCHELLIG:Right. LEVINE:He’s seventy-nine now. Okay, well, I’m happy to be here, and would you start out by saying your whole name and your birth date? SCHELLIG:Well, my name is Hans Alfred Schellig. And my birthday is March 29th, 1914. I was born in Germany, in a little place called Planitz. P-L-A-N-I-T-Z. Germany. And my father came over a year before we did. And he got himself established in the United States, got a job, bought a house, then brought the family over, which in... LEVINE:Were you, excuse me. Were you in Planitz the entire time until you... SCHELLIG:Yes. I was born and brought up in Planitz. LEVINE:...till you left? SCHELLIG:Yes. LEVINE:Yeah. SCHELLIG:Yes. LEVINE:Can you tell me something about your life in Planitz before you came over here? SCHELLIG:Well, I remember going to school, of course. I’m eleven, I was eleven and a half years old. I remember most of the time we went bare footed in the summertime. Always remember buying a new pair of shoes at Eastertime. But otherwise it was just a fun time. We had a lot fun with the kids out in the street. LEVINE:What did your father do when he was still there? SCHELLIG:My father was a painter. LEVINE:An... SCHELLIG:A professional painter. LEVINE:An artist, or house... SCHELLIG:Not an art, not an artist. Not an artist, a house painter. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SCHELLIG:He had, he went through school and became a real good painter. LEVINE:And do you remember the house you lived in? SCHELLIG:Yes, I do. When I was over there, when that was during the war I was over there, and I made arrangements to go to Planitz. And, with a truck driver who went through Planitz. And we were going to go on a Friday, and this was on a Tuesday. And I remember distinctly setting up the date, and I was shipped out on Thursday. So I never got to Planitz. But we did go over there, my wife and I went over, and, oh, maybe ten years ago. And we got as far as Kaemnitz? Kaemnitz. Which was the border between the east and the west. And we got to the border, to the Russian border, and we were all set to go in, and the Russians told me that I had to stay overnight. All I said, all I want to do is go in there and look at the place I was born and come back out again. And the Russians said, ‘No way. You have to stay overnight.’ Well, we had to meet somebody else that day, so we couldn’t go again. I was (unintelligible) didn’t go. LEVINE:So you never saw Planitz... SCHELLIG:So I never saw Planitz again. LEVINE:...again. SCHELLIG:No. I wanted to see it so bad. Now, of course, I could drive in there and, no problem. LEVINE:Right. Well, describe the house that you lived in. What was it made of, what did you see when you walked in... SCHELLIG:It was a large brick house connected with about twelve other houses. And there must have been about five floors. We lived up on the fifth floor. LEVINE:Was it apartments on each floor? Was it... SCHELLIG:Yeah. Yeah. Well, they were apartments, yeah. And I remember we had pigs in our backyard. We slaughtered our own pigs. I remember that. And I remember my father had a bicycle. That’s the only way he could get around town. And he’s worked on that bicycle almost every Sunday, polishing it, getting it all nice and clean. (he laughs) LEVINE:Do you remem, what was your father’s name? SCHELLIG:Alfred. LEVINE:And your mother’s name? SCHELLIG:My mother’s name was Paula. LEVINE:And do you remember your mo... SCHELLIG:And my mother died when I was four years old, in childbirth. LEVINE:Oh. SCHELLIG:My sister. When my sister, four year old sister was born. She was four years. LEVINE:So you sister lived? SCHELLIG:Or I was four years. LEVINE:Your sister lived and your mother died in child... SCHELLIG:Yes. Yes. Yes. LEVINE:What was your mother’s maiden name, do you know? SCHELLIG:Gruner. Paula Gruner. And I would like someday to find out more about it, because I don’t remember too much about my mother. LEVINE:Do you remember anything at all about your mother? SCHELLIG:Well, I remember she was a tall, beautiful woman. And I remember when she died they had her laying on the floor. And they brought me in, and I looked at her. I remember that. LEVINE:Do you remember any experiences with her when you were very young? SCHELLIG:No. No. And then I had, my grandmother would bring me up, brought me up from then on. LEVINE:Was this your mother’s mother? SCHELLIG:No, my father’s mother. My father’s mother. LEVINE:Your father’s mother. SCHELLIG:My father’s mother. LEVINE:And what was her name? SCHELLIG:My grandmother? Oh, you got me. LEVINE:Well, maybe you could just... SCHELLIG:I don’t... LEVINE:...what did you call her as a child? SCHELLIG:I don’t remember my grandmother’s name. Isn’t that strange. I don’t remember. LEVINE:Well, you would have called her... SCHELLIG:It hasn’t been, hasn’t been brought up in so long that... LEVINE:Yeah. Well, you have your wife’s genealogy to fall back on. (the sound of paper rustling) SCHELLIG:Augusta? Augusta Nurenberger? That wasn’t my grandmother. No. No. No, I’m sorry. I don’t, I don’t remember. I guess, no, I don’t remember. LEVINE:Do you remember any experiences with your grandmother, (unintelligible) things that you did... SCHELLIG:Well, my grandmother brought me up for about, I’d say three or four years, and then my father married again. LEVINE:I see. SCHELLIG:And when she married she brought a young fellow with her, a son. And she’s the one that brought us up. LEVINE:I see. SCHELLIG:And when my father left Germany, and we followed him a year, we sold everything in the place, and the whole family came over. Which would be my step brother, my mother, my two sisters and me. LEVINE:So you had a sister who was older? SCHELLIG:Yes. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SCHELLIG:We were all four years apart. Four, eight, and twelve. LEVINE:So what was your oldest sister’s name? SCHELLIG:Twelve. Martha. LEVINE:Martha. And then... SCHELLIG:She married a Kammerer. Martha Kammerer. LEVINE:Uh-huh. And is she in this country? SCHELLIG:She was in this country, but she died. LEVINE:She’s gone. Uh-huh. SCHELLIG:She died. LEVINE:And your younger sister’s name? SCHELLIG:My younger sister [sic] name was Elsa. She died when she was eighteen. She dropped dead at eighteen. The doctor in Germany told us that she would be very lucky if she reached the age of eighteen. LEVINE:Why was that? SCHELLIG:Well, we don’t know, but my wife was a nurse. And between the two of us we think that she had an open heart. Open, she had a hole in her heart, which today could be fixed. At that time they didn’t know what it was all about. They knew it was there. They knew, they knew it was fatal. That’s why he said she might not reach eighteen. LEVINE:And how about your step brother, your, your step mother’s son... SCHELLIG:Richard. LEVINE:Richard. SCHELLIG:Richard. Richard Doring. LEVINE:D-O-R-I-N-G? SCHELLIG:I-N-G. Yeah, Doring. Yes. LEVINE:Okay. Well, tell me anything you can remember about your grandmother for those years before your mother, your father remarried. SCHELLIG:Well, she was a lovely old gal. She took very good care of us. We loved her to death. LEVINE:Did she cook? Do you remember things she cooked? SCHELLIG:Oh, yeah, she cooked. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially after we slaughtered pigs. We made our own sausage, and oh, we went through a lot of trouble to do all that stuff. But my grandmother was a wonderful person. LEVINE:Did you, was your grandfather alive at that time? SCHELLIG:No. No. No. No. LEVINE:And... SCHELLIG:We had to leave her. She died a few years later. LEVINE:That must have been hard. SCHELLIG:Yeah. LEVINE:Yeah. So tell me about your step mother. What was her name? SCHELLIG:My step mother’s name was Hanna, Johanna. Johanna Doring. But she was Johanna Schellig. She was a lovely person. We were very fond of my brother, step brother, Richard. And we all went to work at Vassar College, which is in Poughkeepsie, New York. LEVINE:Oh. SCHELLIG:The whole family worked at Vassar College. My uncle was head baker, my father was head painter, and I was second in charge of the baker, and Richard was the head of the bakery, too. So we were all, we, we put in years and years at Vassar College. LEVINE:Oh, really interesting. SCHELLIG:Yeah. LEVINE:Well, before we leave Germany, now, what do you remember about school there? SCHELLIG:School. I have a couple pictures of school. That’s about all I remember. I remember we had a real tough German teacher, a man, with whiskers, black whiskers and crew cut. And he was real tough. He’d clobber you acrossed [sic] your fingers with a ruler like there was no tomorrow. I remember that, but that’s about all I do remember. (he laughs) LEVINE:How about religion? Was your family religious? SCHELLIG:Yes. We were Lutherans. (he pauses) Yeah, we were religious, yeah. LEVINE:Did you, how did you observe... SCHELLIG:More religion in America than we did in Germany. I don’t remember much of religion in Germany. Don’t remember any, I do remember the church bell in Planitz. It fell off, and we got a new one. I remember being there mostly all afternoon watching them put it up. And I remember one time there was a, I was coming home from somewhere and I was late. And my mother said, ‘Where have you been?’ So I said, ‘Well, there’s ten houses on fire down the street.’ Such and such a place. And she says, ‘Ten houses on fire?’ I says, ‘Yeah.’ I just wanted a good excuse so my father wouldn’t beat me up. He didn’t beat me up too much, but he was pretty, pretty tough at that time. So after supper she says, ‘Let’s go see the ten houses.’ (he laughs) And we walked down there, and all the little outhouses are on fire. And I (unintelligible) the ten houses every time I tell a fib. No matter where I am. (he laughs) But I do remember that. LEVINE:Do you remember any chores that you had to do as a child? SCHELLIG:Chores? No, I really don’t. I don’t remember too many chores, no. LEVINE:Do you remember what you did for fun, for amusement or... SCHELLIG:Well, played a lot of soccer out in the street. We did a lot of running around. We had a lake nearby, and I played soccer. We had a big soccer in back of our complex, or house. Apartment, whatever it was. And I played a lot of soccer. So when I came to America I played semi professional soccer for the Germania in Poughkeepsie, New York. LEVINE:Do you remember what your father communicated to the family when he came over, what you heard about America before you actually came, and his experience? SCHELLIG:Well, my, my uncle was head baker at Vassar College. And we had gotten a lot of letters from him. And he was a little lonely over here, because there no, none, none of the other family was over. That’s why he said come on over and then bring the whole family over. And he helped my father tremendously with a job at Vassar College, got him all set up. He helped buy a house for us, and he was a very good man. LEVINE:This is your father’s brother? SCHELLIG:Yeah, my father’s brother. LEVINE:And what was his name? SCHELLIG:Kurt. LEVINE:And so he sent... SCHELLIG:Kurt Schellig. LEVINE:...money for your father to come first? SCHELLIG:Yes. LEVINE:And then your father went and was there a year. And then he brought the rest of the family? SCHELLIG:The whole family, yeah. He was over here one year. They bought the house on Davis Avenue in Arlington, and brought the whole family over. And I remember yet arriving at the central, at the railroad station. And we all got on this great, big, flat touring car. It was a real, real old, it wasn’t old at that time, but it was a real old, big, big touring car. And I remember driving up towards our house. And I often said to my uncle, ‘How can you see where you’re going?’ And when we got to the house, it was about eleven o’clock at night, we all went to bed. The next day when I woke up I went out in the back yard and looked at my house, and it looked like a matchbox. It was, you know, narrow and tall. But it was the only house on the lot, compared to what we had in Germany with ten, twelve houses attached together. So it was great. What a surprise. LEVINE:Do you remember other things that struck you as, as different at first, when you first came from Germany... SCHELLIG:Well, of course... LEVINE:...about this country? SCHELLIG:Of course, I couldn’t speak a word of English. And I remember teaching the kids how to play soccer out in the street. We got all the kids together, and I, I learned language in a hurry. And then I had to, went to school. Of course at those times, today they have special teachers for, for our kids from foreign countries. At that time they did not. When I came, when I went to school the teacher put me in first grade. And she spent all day with me at the black board, teaching me all kinds of things, plus the language. And I was there for about a week or so. And then I went to second grade. I was there for about a month maybe. Then I went to third grade, and on up. And when I got to the eighth grade I was sixteen years old, my father says, ‘That’s it. You go to work.’ And I left school. I went to work at Vassar College with the rest of the family. LEVINE:Well, do you remember leaving Planitz? Do you remember packing to go... SCHELLIG:Yes, yes, remember, yes, remember packing all the trunks and selling all the stuff. We had a great, big, what do they call those musical instruments? They had these great, big discs, they had holes in them, and you played, I don’t remember what they called them, but we had one of those, and we had to get rid of that. That was about the worse thing wanted had to sell, but we had to get rid of it. But I remember packing all that stuff and sending to the... LEVINE:Did people have something like what we call yard sales? SCHELLIG:No. LEVINE:I mean, when you were leaving how did you sell everything? SCHELLIG:No. It’s just by paper. Through the paper. LEVINE:Oh, you put it in the paper? SCHELLIG:Put it in the paper, yeah. Let people know. LEVINE:So, do you remember what your mother packed, or anything that you personally brought with from Germany? SCHELLIG:No. No. I do still have the trunk. I still have the trunk with my name on it, the name of the ship. That’s how we remember the ship. LEVINE:Oh, why don’t you mention the name of the ship. SCHELLIG:The Albert Ballin. Yeah, the Albert Ballin. Yeah, I remember that. And I remember on the ship, my mother was seasick throughout the whole trip. It must have taken us almost three weeks to cross the ocean at that time. And my mother was always, was very, very sick, and I was always over in first class. We were travelling fourth class. And I was a little boy, and I was running around, and the purser got a hold of me, and he’d grab me by my ear and take me back to fourth class. (he laughs) I no sooner got to fourth class that I was back over in first class. It got so they knew me pretty well. LEVINE:Well, can you, can you contrast the fourth class with the first class on the Albert Ballin? SCHELLIG:Well, we had a lot of immigrants, such as a lot of Polish people, a lot of Russian people, Jewish people. I don’t remember any colored people. But we were down in the hold. We were way down in the bottom of the ship. That’s why, one of the reasons my mother was sick most of the time. Because of seasickness. Don’t remember too much about the rest of my family. I think I left them mostly by going, sneaking over the first, first class. LEVINE:Can you describe what first class was like on that ship? SCHELLIG:Oh, they were dancing, they were had all kinds of food, they were having a beautiful time. They had a beautiful dining room, beautiful dance halls. We had nothing over in fourth class. Yeah, fourth class, yeah. LEVINE:What about food? Do you remember anything about the food on the ship? SCHELLIG:The only thing that I remember is they’d bring out a lot of fruit at night. I don’t remember eating, what kind of food we had or where we had it. I don’t remember that at all. No, I don’t remember that at all. LEVINE:And so, do you remember about the dancing? What was, were there, was there musical instruments on ship? SCHELLIG:Oh, yeah. There was a band. There was a band. Oh, yeah. That’s what I enjoyed, the band music, yeah. Yeah. LEVINE:Do you remember leaving? Was, was, was it unusual for people from Planitz to be coming to America... SCHELLIG:No. LEVINE:...or was that happening quite a bit at that point? SCHELLIG:No. We were about, we about the only ones that I knew that left Planitz at that time. LEVINE:Uh-huh. And so, do you remember saying good-bye to your grandmother and other people? SCHELLIG:Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I remember saying good-bye to all the neighbors. They had a little party for us when we left. Yeah. LEVINE:And then how did you leave Planitz? By what mode of transportation? SCHELLIG:We left by bus to, to a certain spot, then we went by train to Hamburg. Because we caught the Albert Ballin out of Hamburg. LEVINE:And were you, were there any examinations or anything like that before you left? SCHELLIG:Don’t remember. Shots, or anything of that stuff I don’t remember. LEVINE:So is there anything else about the voyage that, that you think of when you think of that time? SCHELLIG:It was a long trip. (he laughs) It was a long trip, that’s about all I know. Of course, as a boy you, you seem to, I ran around a lot. I was all over the ship. I loved to look out the front of the ship and watch the water. I remember that. I remember, oh, I was just all over the place. Yeah. LEVINE:So it was, it was an adventure... SCHELLIG:I was enjoying myself... LEVINE:...that you were in. Yeah. SCHELLIG:...I was having a good time. Yeah. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SCHELLIG:Yeah. LEVINE:And you said, you remember when, when the ship came into the New York Harbor? SCHELLIG:Yes. LEVINE:What was that like for you? SCHELLIG:Well, we all got up on deck to see the Statue of Liberty, of course. Everybody crowded over on one side. It was quite a thrill. It was quite a thrill. LEVINE:Did, did... SCHELLIG:And when I did, when I went back to the Statue of Liberty not too long ago, that’s the one thing I noticed, all the ships out in the port. And I got a big bang out of that, because I remember us sitting out there before they let us in. Yeah. LEVINE:And do you, did you, what did, do you have, can you remember at all what you thought lay ahead for you in this new country? What you expected, or... SCHELLIG:No. LEVINE:...what you had been told, anything like that? SCHELLIG:No, I doubt if I had any, any, I knew that I was going to have a good time, and it was a good country. I had heard a lot about America. But that’s about all I remember about that. Yeah. Yeah. LEVINE:And how about Ellis Island? Any recollections about... SCHELLIG:Ellis Island. I don’t remember too much about Ellis Island. I remember the great hall. I remember the hundreds of people that were there. I think I remember some of the examinations that we went through, and the inter, interrogation that we went through. But when I went back to see the great hall, it brought back a little memory of where I’d been. And, of course, I never saw the individual rooms where they interviewed people. And I talked to quite a few people there when I was there, but that’s about all I remember about it. LEVINE:Now when you, did somebody meet, did your father meet you at Ellis Island? SCHELLIG:No. LEVINE:No. SCHELLIG:No, we travelled strictly from Ellis Island to Grand Central. Is it Grand Central? LEVINE:To get the train? SCHELLIG:Grand Central to catch a train to Poughkeepsie. And my uncle met us in Poughkeepsie railroad station, but not in New York. We did this all on our own, and my brother was the head of it. (he laughs) I remember yet the conductor on the train would put the, stick the ticket in back of the seat. And the, he told my brother, he says, ‘Now leave that ticket there.’ And my brother sort of shook his head up and down, and the minute (unintelligible) he picked it right off and stuck it in his pocket. He wasn’t going to let the, let go of that ticket no how, because he was in charge of six people, you know. (he laughs) LEVINE:How old was he at the time? Richard? SCHELLIG:Let’s see. He must have been eighteen. LEVINE:Yeah. SCHELLIG:He must have been eighteen. LEVINE:So you, you mentioned in this form that you filled out that, that, that Richard had told a story about having signs hanging around your necks? SCHELLIG:Yes. ‘Wanted.’ LEVINE:Tell about that. SCHELLIG:Well, the ‘wanted’ signs is the only thing I would think would be sponsored. Why they said ‘wanted’ at that time, I don’t know. LEVINE:Yeah. SCHELLIG:Unless, maybe in 1925 that’s what they said, you are want, was it wanted? Yeah, wanted. But that, that’s all I remember of that. LEVINE:Yeah. Yeah. SCHELLIG:I would think sponsored would be a better word, but it said wanted. (they laugh) LEVINE:Well, of course, nobody’s English was any good (unintelligible) ... SCHELLIG:Evidently somebody wanted us. I think that’s the way you have to look at it. My uncle wanted us. That’s the way you’d have to look at it. (they laugh) LEVINE:So do you remember anything about that train ride to Poughkeepsie? SCHELLIG:The only thing I remember is the tickets. LEVINE:Yeah. And then the reunion with your uncle. Did you remember your uncle? SCHELLIG:Oh, no, I never met him before. I’d never seen my uncle before. I saw pictures of him. LEVINE:Because he had been in America for a longer while? SCHELLIG:Oh, yes. Oh, yes. He came over when he was sixteen. And he must have been fifty. LEVINE:Oh. Yeah. SCHELLIG:Oh, he’s been over a long time. Yeah. LEVINE:So, do you remember the reunion with your father? SCHELLIG:Yes. Yes, I remember that. He was at the house. And we had a great reunion, the whole family. We all cried. You know, we went through a little reunion after a year not seeing my father and all that stuff. Yeah. Of course, we were sent to bed immediately. As soon as we got there, because it was late at night, eleven o’clock at night when we arrived in Poughkeepsie. LEVINE:Can you re, describe that first morning when you... SCHELLIG:Like I said, the first morning I got up and I went out in back of the house to look what the house looked like. And it looked like a match box. It was so narrow compared to the houses in Germany that were just a conglomeration of houses. It was quite a thrill. And then we had our own garage in the back and a barn, and we had a yard. So it was very nice. LEVINE:And your father was doing painting at that time in Poughkeepsie? SCHELLIG:Yes, he was... LEVINE:Oh, in, at the college... SCHELLIG:At the college. Yes, yes, the college. Yes. LEVINE:...at that time. Uh-huh. So then, when you, after eighth grade when your father told you you had to get to work, what, what, tell me about that, your first job. SCHELLIG:Well, my first job was working in the bakery. Because my, I had a choice. My father gave, my, my uncle gave me a choice. I could work with my uncle as a baker, or I could work with my father as a painter. I says, ‘I think I’ll go with my uncle.’ (they laugh) Why... LEVINE:What do you... SCHELLIG:...why, I still don’t know today, but I went with my uncle. LEVINE:Well, did, do you remember your uncle? How would you describe him? What kind of a man was he? SCHELLIG:Well, he was a short fellow, but he was very strong. As a matter of fact, after we knew about him, he was a strongman with the circus. With Sandar. He worked with Sandar, the strongest man in the, in the, in the country. And Lilian, Lilian who? Oh, anyway. She was with the show. LEVINE:Uh-huh. I see. Lilian Russell? And, and he travelled? Did he travel with the circus? SCHELLIG:He travelled with the circus. But when he came over, he came over by himself at the age of fifteen half or sixteen. He had nobody, he had no money, he had no nothing. As a matter of fact I remember him telling stories about selling moonshine and liquor in New York City. Sleeping on the grates of, of the subway to keep warm, and knocking on the back door of restaurants and asking for scraps of, scraps of food. And he was a great Y.M.C.A. man. He joined the Y.M.C.A. That’s how he became a strongman. Then at the age of eighteen or nineteen he went to Canada. And he went to baker’s school. And he learned how to bake. And they hired him at Vassar College. And he was there at Vassar College for fifty years. And every summer we went to Chautauqua, New York, which is a summer musical educational institute in Jamestown. It’s just outside of Jamestown, New York. And every summer when the college closed, we all had to find ourselves a job, because we were out of work. So Mr., my uncle got a crew together. He got a chef, he got cooks, he got bakers, he got the whole works together, and the whole crew went up to Chautauqua at the hotel. And we served about four hundred people up there for two months. July and August. And when we came back, we went back to Vassar College. But most of my education I got at Vassar College. Because every year the Vassar girls would come around and say, ‘John.’ Of course, I changed my, something I forgot to tell you. When I went to school, the teacher asked me what my name was, and I said my name was Johannes Alfred Schellig. She says, ‘We’re going to call you John.’ And I have been John ever since. There is no change in names, no, went through no lawyer, no nothing, went, my name is John. So, when I went to Vassar College, the girls would come down the bakery and say, ‘John, what are you going to take up this year?’ So I took up, well, she says, ‘What do you want to take?’ I says, ‘Well, I’ll take, I’ll take typing.’ So they got me, a Vassar girl taught me typing. We had our own club, Vassar, the employees club. Classrooms on top, dance hall in the middle, living room in the middle, and pool tables and stuff down in the bottom. So I learned how to type. Then another year I took tap dancing and dancing. (they laugh). I took, every, every year, I, skiing. And I had a friend of mine who was a janitor. And these girls at Vassar College were the richest girls in the world. Senator’s daughters, president’s daughters. They were from all over the country. This janitor friend of mine would say, ‘You want a set of golf clubs?’ I’d say, ‘Yeah.’ And I’d get a Vassar girl to teach me to play golf. ‘You want a tennis racket?’ I’d say, ‘Yeah.’ I’d get a Vassar girl to teach me to play tennis. ‘You want a pair of skis?’ ‘Yeah.’ I’d get a Vassar girl to teach me to ski. And that’s how I got most of my education. LEVINE:So you had private tutoring in whatever you... SCHELLIG:I had my own private tutor. And I graduated in Vassar College after twelve years. (they laugh) I joined the army. I signed up to join the army. LEVINE:Why did you do that? SCHELLIG:Well, it was summertime and we had to go find a job. I said I may as well go, they were going to get me anyway, you know, they were going to eventually catch me. So I enlisted. LEVINE:In what, in the army? SCHELLIG:In the army. And one of my big subjects was, I went to Chicago. And I was stationed in the hotel, and the first thing I had to do was wash walls. That’s the one thing I didn’t want, never wanted to do at Vassar College. That’s why I joined my father, my uncle to become a baker. First thing I had to do was wash walls. So I was washing walls. This sergeant came in and says, ‘Is there anybody here that can type?’ And I said, ‘Yes, I can.’ He says, ‘Well, come with me.’ So he introduced me to the colonel. And the colonel says, ‘John, how far did you go in school?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, ‘that’s a sad subject. Only went to eighth grade.’ He says, ‘Can you type?’ I said, ‘Yeah, that’s why I’m here. I can type.’ He says, ‘Okay, I’ll give you a week’s trial. If you don’t succeed we’ll ship you out. I was with the man for three years.’ LEVINE:What year was that when you signed up? SCHELLIG:1942. And I finally was shipped to Germany. I was in Nuremberg, stationed at Nuremberg. That’s why I wanted to get back to Zwiggerhau [PH] with a truck, with the army. LEVINE:How did it feel being shipped to Germany during the second world war? SCHELLIG:Well, what I couldn’t understand was there were no questions asked, there was no, you know, there was not, not even a if, and or but about me being, I’d said we were born (unintelligible) Germany. There were no, no, no questions, no nothing. I just went. LEVINE:Wow. Well, how do you feel that you personally have been affected by having been born in Germany, and lived the first eleven and a half years in Germany, and then moving to American, more or less starting... SCHELLIG:Well, one of things we have always said, both my wife and I, is we’re very, very lucky we did come to America, or I would have been in the German army. And Lord knows what would have happened then. I would have to follow the Nazi rule and all that kind of thing. I’m, I’m just thankful, thank God I wasn’t there. So I consider myself very, very, very lucky. And I landed in Le Havre, France on V.E. Day, so the war was practically over when I got there. So I was pretty lucky. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO LEVINE:How did you meet your wife? SCHELLIG:Well, working at Vassar College. She had a ne, a cousin that worked there. And the cousin wanted to go out with me, and she wanted to have a blind date for her. And we decided that we were going to meet at the club house, at the college club house. And John, friend of mine, John, John Idle, John would say, ‘Well, I don’t want to go with, I want to go with Eleanor.’ And I said, ‘I want to go with Eleanor.’ Nobody wanted to go with the blind date. She was the blind date. s(he laughs) So there was John’s car. And John says, ‘Well, let’s stay outside and wait which girl gets in the front and which one gets in the back. I’m the driver. Whoever gets in front that’s my date, whoever gets in back.’ So nobody wanted to get in the car. But I wound up with Eleanor. LEVINE:So what was... SCHELLIG:And, I was a, I was a very good actor. Not good actor, I was a lot of, I did a lot of acting in Vassar College. The Vassar girls put on a play every year. (unintelligible) employees. And I was the lead actor for about, oh, I’d say ten years. And I was in the play one year, and she was in the audience. And she told her mother, she told her mother, she said, ‘See that fellow up there? I’m going to marry him.’ And that’s how we got together and we got married. LEVINE:What was your wife’s... SCHELLIG:And I went to Chautauqua every summer and left her home. LEVINE:Oh. SCHELLIG:And she kept saying, I want to get married, I want to go to Chautauqua, and all that stuff. Well, I said no, no, no. She’s a nurse. She went to nursing school. And I said you finish your nursing job before we get married. So she had four years of nursing. LEVINE:For the tape say your wife’s name and maiden name. SCHELLIG:My wife’s name is Hilda Louise Russell, is her maiden name. Because Hilda Schellig is her married name. And she’s about two years younger than I am. We’ve been married for fifty-six years. LEVINE:Maybe we could have your wife say, how did you know you were going to marry him when you saw him on stage? MRS. SCHELLIG:I just liked him right away. And I didn’t say it when I saw him on the stage, but I saw, I said it right after the first date. (they laugh) SCHELLIG:Correction. (he laughs) LEVINE:Well, do you have children? SCHELLIG:Yes. We have one daughter who is a microbiologist at the University of Connecticut. LEVINE:And what’s her name? SCHELLIG:Her name is Hilda, her name is Lynne. Lynne Elsa Schellig. And she got married. She married a gentleman who is also a graduate at University of Connecticut. His name is Hinckley. Henry Hinckley. LEVINE:Grandchildren? SCHELLIG:And I have three grandsons. John, Russell and Clark. John is a, a professional musician. Clark is undecided, and Russell is a teacher. He’s become, become a teacher. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SCHELLIG:We still live, leave here, we leave Florida for three months, four months. Four months? Four months, and have a home in Connecticut. My daughter has a hundred twenty-five acre farm, and on this farm we have a double mobile home, which is ours. And Henry’s mother has a big house, and then my daughter has a big house. So the whole family’s all just one big complex now. Yeah. LEVINE:What makes you feel very proud or satisfied about having done in your life? SCHELLIG:Well, beings, coming over from Germany, not knowing, not learning to speak a word of English, and not having a college education, which I think I would have done very well in. Because I, as, as I say, I went to work for this colonel, and he only gave me a week’s trial, and I stayed with him for three years. I jumped from private to sergeant, from sergeant to staff sergeant, went right on up. And it’s a great satisfaction. LEVINE:Did you stay, did you leave the army then after... SCHELLIG:Yes. In 1945 I left the army. And through all the education I had I really began realize my potential. And I did go back to Vassar College for about two months. But then I quit, and I, most of my jobs have been sales. In sales, sales work, salesmanship. LEVINE:And how about this time in your life? How do you feel about this phase of retirement? SCHELLIG:Well, this time of life we’re really enjoying ourselves. I bowl. As you know I went bowling today. And I play golf twice a week. I fish in my own back yard. And we’re very comfortable. We’re not very rich. We’re, we’re poor. As a matter of fact we’re, we’re, we’re not poor, but we’re just getting, we’re just getting by. (they laugh) But I think we’re really... LEVINE:But you’re happy. SCHELLIG:We’re really enjoying life. Enjoying life. Yeah. LEVINE:Okay. Well is there anything else, if you were to think of some part of yourself being German and some part being American, would, would you say any qualities that you have that are the German side, and the... SCHELLIG:Well, the German side I think always teach, I think the German side is more of a stricter side. Not that I’m strict with anybody, but I think it teaches you neat, neatness. Clean, cleanliness. It’s, when I see some of these driving through, some places, even here in, in Florida, and see some of these homes where people don’t respect their home. They, they don’t take care of it like they should. Many do, but there are a lot of them that don’t. And I think of the things that taught me to keep everything ship shape is army life, and being a German. LEVINE:Was, was the attitude of your mother and father, when you came to this country, was it to become assimilated and americanized or... SCHELLIG:Yes. LEVINE:...or to retain your... SCHELLIG:No. No. I did learn German. We did speak German at home. But being married to an American girl I don’t speak as much German as my sister did. My sister was strictly all German, because she married a German fellow. The whole family spoke German. And she never got over her, her... LEVINE:Accent? Accent? SCHELLIG:Accent. She never got over her accent. Which I think I did. But... LEVINE:Well, is there anything else you can think of that you might want to say before we close? SCHELLIG:Well, it’s, enjoyed talking to you. LEVINE:Well, I’ve enjoyed, you said you had nothing to say, but see? SCHELLIG:I enjoyed... LEVINE:You had a lot to say. SCHELLIG:I enjoyed my trip to Ellis Island. Especially driving down to New York, and seeing all the ships at dock. Because I remember with the, I took her down one time. She, my wife is a nurse, and she studied in New York for six months. Six months? At, at one of the big hospitals, and we spent a lot of time down there. And I do remember going, taking her to the Queen Elizabeth, at the docks in New York, and going through the Queen Elizabeth, yelling, her yelling downstairs, ‘Get me out of here,’ because she has claustrophobia. But when we went by New York, and I saw all the big ships it was a real thrill. It was a real thrill. And it was enjoyable taking a ride to Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty. And I’d gone to the Statue, as a matter of fact, I forgot to tell you, I’m a past commander of the V.F.W. in Poughkeepsie, and I’m a past commander of the Legion. So I’m really involved with the veteran’s organization. And the, as a veteran we went to Ellis Island many times. LEVINE:Oh. SCHELLIG:So I really enjoyed the trip down there. LEVINE:Wonderful. Well, it’s been a pleasure. SCHELLIG:Yeah. LEVINE:I’m so happy I got a chance to talk with you. SCHELLIG:Enjoyed talking to you. LEVINE:Thank you very much. SCHELLIG:Yeah. LEVINE:This is Janet Levine. I’ve been speaking with John Schellig. And I’m here at Mr. Schellig’s home in Florida. And it is February 21st, President’s Day, 1994, and I’m signing off. (he laughs)
