And where were you born? IANNELLI: In Italy, in Naples. SENATOR: In Naples. What did Naples look like at that time? IANNELLI: If I could remember, it was like a mess. I don't know about today. SENATOR: Can you describe the town at all? How was it a mess? IANNELLI: They didn't keep everything in place like they do today. Stuff on the street, they sell stuff on the street.

Any memories? Stories about him? IANNELLI: Oh, I got to tell all his stories? I don't know all his stories. SENATOR: Or just if you have a memory... IANNELLI: I remember he had a couple of fights with people but I don't remember everything. Of course, he was in the business. He was a barber. He bought the place apart from another guy. Now this, he came from Italy that time and they said, "Well one of us, the two of us can't live over here. We got to do half each." So my father took the, the (she pauses) he took the barber shop. That's how I remember. And they had a lot of them between the two men. SENATOR: And the barber shop, where was that? IANNELLI: Columbus Street. SENATOR: In... INNAELLI: In Brooklyn.

I've got nothing bad to say about my mother. But she was good. SENATOR: Do you have any memories of her? IANNELLI: Oh plenty. I got all my kids, they remember my mother. They always talking about her. That's why I said she (gesturing to her daughter) should be here because she knows more than what I know. She's young girl and she's got better memory.

Could you describe your house in Italy? IANNELLI: Oh, I have a beautiful home. Then when I come over here I was disappointed because we had to go to sleep in back of the store. Then my father had a barbershop, then. He can't afford to get the rooms. You know it was very bad. That time was very bad so we had to sleep in the back and I cried like a baby. I want to go back to Italy. I didn't like it. But then I got used to it. Now, I'm happy here now. I got married over here. I got all my daughters married. I lost my husband nineteen years ago. But, he, he came from the same place I come from. I met him over here. SENATOR: Oh, he's also from Naples. IANNELLI: Yes the same (unintelligable) And it was good friend of my mother, his mother and my mother. And I met him over here. SENATOR: And what was his name? IANNELLI: Philip. SENATOR: Philip Iannelli. IANNELLI: Yes. SENATOR: Okay. IANNELLI: The only one. (she laughs) SENATOR: Who lived with you in Italy? IANNELLI: Nobody. Me, my mother and the kids. And my father was here in America. SENATOR: Really. IANNELLI: Yeah, and then he sent for us. SENATOR: Okay. IANNELLI: That's why we came. That's how I remember my father very good because only the first year we seen him. He came with the boat, you know the little boat. We were on the ship. When we sailed here, we were on the ship and he was with the boat. And he's going, "Who's you father?" "There he is." (she laughs) SENATOR: When did your father leave Italy? IANNELLI: Oh, you mean the first time? Well, he used to work on the ship, back and forth, you know? I could say maybe I was about ten years old. I can't remember everything. (she laughs) SENATOR: Why did he leave? IANNELLI: Because he didn't make enough money. He wanted to come in America to make enough money to make us so we could live better. By that time we lived worst, 'cause we lived better in Italy at that time. But now it's, it's okay. SENATOR: Um hum. And what did he do on the boat? Do you... IANNELLI: He's a fireman. You know. SENATOR: He was a fireman on... IANNELLI: On the boat, yeah. SENATOR: Where did the boat go? IANNELLI: In Italy, in Naples and America. SENATOR: Okay. So it would go back and forth. IANNELLI: Back and forth used to go. Yeah, then the last time he got stuck over here and then he sent for the family. SENATOR: Where (she pauses) Did you have other family members in Naples? IANNELLI: Oh yeah, my mother, my grandmother, my aunt, all the family was there. SENATOR: And did you see them often? IANNELLI: Oh yeah, when we were there. Yeah.

IANNELLI: Oh yeah, we had a church. SENATOR: Could you describe what the church... IANNELLI: Oh where we lived, that was about a couple of years we lived. I remember the church, it was a small church. And we used to go every Sunday and then when there was a christening in the church, we used to go too. SENATOR: Can you recite any prayers or anything like that? IANNELLI: What do you mean prayers? SENATOR: Prayers that you would say in church. IANNELLI: Yeah, prayers in Italian. SENATOR: Um hum. IANNELLI: Yeah. SENATOR: Can you recite one for me. (Mrs. Iannelli laughs) Do you remember? IANNELLI: (she recites the Ave Maria.) SENATOR: Thank you. Did you go to school in Italy? IANNELLI: Yes. SENATOR: You did? IANNELLI: Yes. Yeah just for, when I was young. Then when I came over here my father take, I take the transfer to make me go to school.

My mother used to, she used to sew for the people. I used to deliver the cloths and they used to give me tips all the time because I was a kid. And that's how we, we can make to money to come to America. SENATOR: Really. And you did this while you were going to school? IANNELLI: What do you mean? SENATOR: You worked and you went to school at the same time... IANNELLI: No, no... SENATOR: ...in Italy? IANNELLI: No. SENATOR: No. IANNELLI: I just went to school, that's it. Most of the time I used to be in the house 'cause my mother used to be sick all the time. And I, she need me for help. SENATOR: What... IANNELLI: That's the only reason I don't go to school. My sister went to school. SENATOR: And what was her illness? IANNELLI: My mother? She had the cancer. SENATOR: In Italy? IANNELLI: No, no, over here. SENATOR: Over here, okay.

And the first job I got in the laundry. (she laughs) Fold the cloths you know. I just, but I was big. And then another job I got in the button factory, make, work at a machine, make the buttons. And that's how we got along. Except when we got enough money, we moved back to Brooklyn. And my father rented a house, we had a nice home and we did all right since then. SENATOR: So when did you move from Brooklyn? IANNELLI: After two years we were in America 'cause my father couldn't take care of my mother no more. She used to get headaches all the time so, she, the best was make her go over to her sister. And she, you know, and she was happy with her sister. She was depressed because she left her mother there, she left another sister, she left, she left her family, see? But then she got used to it too. Then after two years we were in Jersey, we went back to Brooklyn. And when I, we went back to Brooklyn, I got another job in the dates factory, like they make the dates. SENATOR: Dates? IANNELLI: The dates, you know, the dates you eat. SENATOR: Oh okay. (Mrs. Iannelli laughs) IANNELLI: And I went to work again.

And I used to get on top of the fence 'cause I was small. (she laughs) SENATOR: How did you feel about leaving school and going to work? IANNELLI: I feel bad but then I, I see the situation. My mother was sick, she only depended on me. So I helped my father with the barbershop, too. I washed all the towels for him, and I get the barbershop ready. It was a lot of help. SENATOR: Okay. And when did you move back to Brooklyn? IANNELLI: Oh I think after three years, about three years. SENATOR: Why did you move back? IANNELLI: I moved back 'cause my father had the business over there.
