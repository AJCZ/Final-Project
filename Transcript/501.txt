FISHER: A school, and they were teaching very nice and good and everything. SIGRIST: Were you getting a religious education, also? FISHER: Yes, but I don't remember no more, you know. And they used to have reports, you know, you used to give out report books and, very nice. SIGRIST: Do you... FISHER: Europe people were (she laughs) the same people as we are.

SIGRIST: So the school was part of the synagogue? FISHER: Yes. They had (synagartens?), that's rabbis, you know, in our shul. And they had schools. They had a, a college in one of the city, in Bialystok. They had a, they were normal, we were all normal people. SIGRIST: Was the town that you lived in near Bialystok? FISHER: Yes. SIGRIST: So it wasn't far from Bialystok... FISHER: No. SIGRIST: ...where you grew up. FISHER: No, no, no. In Grodno gubernia, the name of it was. SIGRIST: That's right. That's near the Polish border. FISHER: That's right. SIGRIST: Uh, did, did... FISHER: You know, I don't remember a lot of things, too (she laughs) many years. SIGRIST: Were, were little girls allowed to get an education? FISHER: Oh, everybody was allowed. Everybody was. SIGRIST: Could your parents read and write? FISHER: Yes, Jewish. And whoever wanted went to night school and learned English. SIGRIST: That was here in America. FISHER: No, in Europe. In Europe they had a night school, too. SIGRIST: You could learn English in Europe? FISHER: That's right. That's right. SIGRIST: Now, why did your family want to come to America? FISHER: Oh, America was better things. You know, you worked, you got more money. And it (?) you know, people, there was a lot of things here in America. SIGRIST: Did you have relatives who lived in America? FISHER: Everybody moved to America. They moved, they came back. (voices can be heard over the intercom system in the background) They, but they, everybody, I had relatives all over, you know, Jewish people, my, my own. SIGRIST: Now, when your father died, you're still in Russia when your father died? FISHER: Yes, oh, yes, oh, yes. SIGRIST: Is that the reason why... FISHER: I think after the last child was born he died. And then my aunt and uncle, that's my mother sister, she didn't have no children. I'm going to tell you the whole business, what I remember (she laughs), you know. So he died and I, I was born and I was a year or close to two years, he died. And then my aunt never had children so she, she was my mother's sisters, you know, another, uh, she had a husband, you know, but no children. So, then I was born before (voices can be heard over the intercom system in the background) my father died. And then he died and the children were left. And she came with her husband and said she wants to take one child from my mother. She had three, she wants to take one child if she'd give her. So she gave me, you know. So I went to, with them in Espuhskeh [ph], another, he was a carpenter on my, the uncle, you know. And I lived with them quite a while. Then they, we all came to America. SIGRIST: Did you come to America with your aunt? FISHER: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: And what about your own mother? FISHER: My mother came, the children got bigger so she came. They, they all went, came to America or other places, you know. And then she did, I did, then I got older and I got married. SIGRIST: When you lived with your aunt... FISHER: I got married. SIGRIST: In Russia, when you were living with your aunt, did you see your mother a lot or not? FISHER: Oh, yeah, yeah. Not a lot, you know, every time they used to come, somebody used to bring them for a couple of hours, you know. Then my mother, then, then she, she came to live with me. (voices can be heard over the intercom system in the background) So my mother lived, then she got married again. SIGRIST: Is this in America? FISHER: No, no, in Europe. SIGRIST: In Europe. She got married again in Europe. FISHER: Yeah, yeah. So, then she came to America with her new husband. SIGRIST: Were you already here? FISHER: I was there. I was in America already... SIGRIST: I see. FISHER: ...with my aunt. I went to school. SIGRIST: Do you remember, before you left Russia when you were living with your aunt... FISHER: Yeah. SIGRIST: ...and, and your aunt and uncle decided that you were going to come to America... FISHER: Yeah, they came for me... SIGRIST: Did they come...? FISHER: ...to bring me, that's right. SIGRIST: They, they came before you did? FISHER: Yeah, just to take me when I was young yet. SIGRIST: Do you remember what you packed to take to America? FISHER: No, I wouldn't. Whatever I had, (she laughs), I'm, I'm sure I didn't have too much. SIGRIST: Do you remember where you went to get the ship? FISHER: In Ellis Island. SIGRIST: No, no, before Ellis Island. When you were leaving Europe, where did you have to go to get on the ship? FISHER: Oh, that's where, uh, the place where they have the ships that used to take you all over. SIGRIST: Do you remember the name of the city where you left from? FISHER: Bial--, uh, we left (Narewka?) and then... SIGRIST: And then how did you go to get the boat? How did you travel to get the boat? FISHER: Oh, on a horse and wagon. A lot of things I don't remember. (they laugh) SIGRIST: Tonight you'll remember them. Do you remember being on the ship? FISHER: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember the name of the ship? FISHER: Oh, no, no. SIGRIST: No, okay. Tell me what you remember about being on the ship as a little eleven year old girl. FISHER: Well, I'll tell you, you know, there they used to go and put my name on somebody else's family when they were going to America, you know. They, they didn't know it wasn't, I don't belong to them. And that's how they used to take over. And they used to pay the people when they went to America with them, with me like. SIGRIST: As a chaperone for you. FISHER: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they used to take care of, uh, 'til my aunt and uncle came. That's how I got to America first, too. SIGRIST: So you had a chaperone with you on the boat. FISHER: Yeah, yeah. A family with a few kids of their own and I was another kid. SIGRIST: Now, do you remember where you stayed on the ship? FISHER: On the ship? SIGRIST: Yeah, but where in the boat? Where did you, where did you sleep at night? FISHER: We, oh, I don't remember that much. I'm here so many years.

FISHER: Oh, yes, yes. SIGRIST: What, is that where your aunt met you? FISHER: That's right. SIGRIST: And what do you remember about being there? FISHER: Nothing, just a lot of people from different places. we were kids who (?). I saw my aunt. I didn't know her, you know, I didn't remember her. So my uncle, he was a very nice man. He used to say, "We going to be just like your father was." We were, I will never forget it. He said, "(Yiddish)" That's all. And then they went away and (a week late again?) SIGRIST: Where did they, where did they take you to live? FISHER: With my aunt. SIGRIST: When you left Ellis Island, where did your aunt live? FISHER: In Espuhskeh [ph]. SIGRIST: No, I mean in America. Where did, where did, where did you go to live in America when you first got here? FISHER: I didn't live there right away.
