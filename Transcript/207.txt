BROZINSKAS' DAUGHTER, ANNE B. POVILAITIS DATED SEPTEMBER 23, 1994: Dear Mr. Sigrist: I would like to convey to you that my mother, Justina Brozinskas, passed away on July 9, 1994 at the age of 99 years old. Before her death she had related to me several things she forgot to mention in her interview. Her father was known as the beekeeper in her town. Made honey and wax. Candles were made and sold to the church. Honey was sold, too. Christmas Eve was a gathering of family and relatives to partake in a traditional dinner. Nine (9) different Lithuanian dishes were made--however, no meat was served at this meal. Straw was placed in the middle of the table resembling the "baby Jesus" crib. A Host in the form of white, flat bread was passed around for each person to break off and eat, so the Good Lord would enlighten their lives. Hazel nuts were gathered for eating and baking purposes--such as cookies at Christmas. Apples were always eaten as one of their staple fruits. Has several apple trees in their orchard. Used them for baking, too. Feathers from their chickens and geese were used to make pillows and bed covers. In the wintertime and going to church and school they wore wooden shoe, which were made by their father. They also had boots made from leather. Lent was a very holy season. No meat was eaten during the entire 9 weeks. So when Easter arrived much cooking and preparation took place with many Lithuanian specialties made from potatoes, cabbage, flour, meats, sausages, breads, cakes. One beverage they enjoyed was tea. The birch tree was their country tree. Many stories, songs and poems included this tree. Amber is a beautiful gem stone of Lithuania. I hope these few additions may be of interest to you to add to my dear mother's biography. Thank you for your interest. Anne B. Povilaitis (daughter of Justina Brozinskas)
