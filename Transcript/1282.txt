PASTERNAK: No WATERS: Okay, Did you go to school when you were in Czechoslovakia? PASTERNAK: Yes WATERS: Can you describe any memories maybe that you have of attending school? PASTERNAK: Well, it was in Czechoslovakia actually they were first five grades public and later and you had to go to school eight years whether you went, want one class in the eight years or not you had attend eight years. If somebody didn’t the police used to come and take them and they had to go but, schools were all right of course, there is certain subjects that because we had I think if I am right about fourteen or fifteen different subjects. Not just like in the United states where it just but over there was about from each one if you failed three times you had to repeat major had to be three time when fail you had to repeat a class again. If you went through five than you would go into the other four classes and than, than you could either go to the four other classes of if you, were good enough you could skip those and go gymnasium. WATERS: Okay, and what did you do, did you go to the gymnasium? PASTERNAK: No, because my family was religious so it was not allowed to study and so I went to Hebrew study after this which is usually when had to travel far away from home and it was six and six months through the year and if, if families that could afford to, to have the child come back after six months they came, if not they had to stay there. WATERS: Where did you go to Hebrew school? PASTERNAK: I went, well, I went in three different ones that were like middle class, and a higher class and each time I was, I went to three different towns, which I attended to my age of eighteen and I stopped it, I didn’t want to study anymore, and that’s. WATERS: Okay. SIGRIST: We should say for the sake of the tape that we are in a room with a refrigerator and it has just kicked on so someone listening to this tape will want to know what that noise is. (he and Mr. Pasternak laugh) WATERS: Mr. Pasternak you said that there were fourteen or fifteen different kind of subjects that you studied, different than America. Maybe you could tell us what kind of subjects you studied? PASTERNAK: Well, for each subject there was each class according the first class was only like reading and writing and the second class was something higher like, like reading, writing this was all different subjects and till you reach the highest class. The first five classes just each year just went higher and higher education. WATERS: Okay, Do you remember what types of games that you played as a child? PASTERNAK: Practic, Practically none, because from the regular school I had to go to the Jewish school and study the religious subject whatever. WATERS: So, you, you never played as a child? PASTERNAK: Practically, maybe the first five years or six years after that what ever was you had to go to synagogue and than religion and Jewish classes from the classes, from the regular classes come home and go to the Jewish classes and than. So, I can say one thing, me as a boy I was not Allowed to, I never had any toys and. WATERS: Did you have chores that you had to do around the home maybe or you just had to concentrate on school? PASTERNAK: Well, most because that was enough, as ages like later on when I went to Synagogue and over there the butcher so, I would bring home the meat. WATERS: Okay, Well you have already said that you were Jewish and that your father was a very religious man maybe you could describe for me some of the different religious practices that you did? PASTERNAK: Well, from the beginning in the morning you had to pray, had to pray and then also that was one kilometer from my house that synagogue was. I had to go first to synagogue and then come home eat and go to regular school and then I came, finished the other school and then you had to go again to Hebrew study. WATERS: Do you maybe remember any special holiday celebrations? PASTERNAK: Well, the holidays it’s the same all over, it’s like the main the holidays of course Sabbath is the main highest religion in Jewish. Then, then you had other, like Rosh, Rosh Hashanah the Jewish New Year, than which, Yom Kippur which, which is a very big holiday too but not bigger than, than Sabbath except if it came together Yom Kippur with Sabbath that was higher but Sabbath was even though a lot of people don’t think that’s the, that’s the highest religion. And then what did I say Yom Kippur and than come what they call Sukes which is, which is in a tent and eat the meals and and then Hanukkah which is eight days and you light the candles. Let’s see if there is any other, can’t just think no but. SIGRIST: (addressing Ms. Waters) Perhaps you might want to ask Mr. Pasternak to say a prayer slowly that he learned as a child. WATERS: Could you, Do you remember any of the prayers that you had to say. PASTERNAK: Yeah. WATERS: Maybe you could say one for us in your, in your native language? PASTERNAK: Yes, in the morning you washed your hands and wash, wash up there was a prayer saying. You want me to say it in Hebrew? WATERS: Yes, please SIGRIST: (addressing Mr. Pasternak) Slowly. PASTERNAK: (recites a prayer in Hebrew) Which, slowly interpreted, I’m, I’m thank you for, because we believe that, at night when you go to sleep that. I can’t explain what it would mean but anyhow. Mostly it’s say I thank you for returning my give me back the. Can I ask something in English when a person dies what do you call it? SIGRIST: Your soul. PASTERNAK: The soul, soul. So on that the prayer is that you are returning my soul and I thank you very, very much for that. That was everyday in the morning saying that was told to all children from, from when they start to speak but when they came the other highers that was very hard. WATERS: Okay. Did you, did you suffer any kind of persecution because of your religion? PASTERNAK: Yeah, yeah there were stone throwing and a calling names ‘you dirty Jew’ and whatever. Of course, I suffered in the Holocaust, I lost my family not my father, my mother actually was here and she died here in United States but it was they died in Holocaust in general the anti- semitism was quiet even, even we were best friends but there was still fights. WATERS: Okay, um Can you tell me why your family decided to come to America? PASTERNAK: Well, because a started with, with Austria was occupied with Germany with Hitler when he started, slowly so, they started to come to Czechoslovakia too and my father, my father used to send money home so he always used to stay in United States one, one, two years and then come home and go back and it came and it came that the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Already being that my father was American citizen so our family was openly not persecuted only, only later when left the United States my sister and me and my mother. Then my family later on when it started with the persecution there started. I was yet in Czechoslovakian army and I was maybe one from the I was maybe from hundred Jews that I was still I wasn’t put in an concentration camp or anything but I still in the army I was, I was, I had to go except the only thing was that I went around with a mark JS, FJ, F, FI which meant friendly in German (states word in German) trustworthy Jew so then the gentiles knew that I was Jewish, but they was afraid openly to do because that time the American had respect at time they were afraid to start until the Polish War. WATERS: Did, did your family have to wear markings also or just you because you were in the army? PASTERNAK: No, before, before we left the family they didn’t start already until 1940, after 1940 already then they started to and Slovakia went together with Germans so then they would picking up. I was still in the Czechoslovakian army there after the Polish War. After the Polish war my father send the papers and tried to bring us not all of the but children were below the twenty-one they were could go without quota otherwise was had to make a quota a certain month. My father always said he had less it was still in 1938 he came to visit the family but they were recalled by the American Consul to come back because they started problem maybe so. WATERS: So, Did were your brothers and sister under twenty-one or? PASTERNAK: They were older. WATERS: They were older. (background noise because of nearby bathroom) PASTERNAK: Only, one younger sister she came with me to the United States. SIGRIST: (addressing Ms. Waters) We are at the thirty minute mark. Just so you know. WATERS: Okay. You said that it was just you and your sister that came to America? PASTERNAK: And my mother. WATERS: And your mother, where, where were your other brothers, your other brother and other sisters? PASTERNAK: They, they remained home and than in 1940 already they started to pick them up. They didn’t they confiscated our houses and they were, slowly put in concentration camp. WATERS: So, you lost your brother and your sisters in a concentration camp than. PASTERNAK: Yeah, most of my mother’s family too. My mother had nine sister, nine sisters they all big family only, only couple maybe five, six survived from that. WATERS: Do you know at all where they were taken or you don’t know what happened to them after they were taken? PASTERNAK: Well, actually I was, we were only told by, by friends of our family who had survived how they were taken Dachau. Well, my brother he didn’t have to go yet but he, he went to himself because of, he knew of the sisters was in which concentration camp, so he, he volunteers as a cook there he thought, this way he could help but when they, he died when they were actually killed I can’t say but I was one of the older sister and a, and a two year old child who was born one of the group that alien group. WATERS: Okay. You said you were in army right before you came to America . Were you released from the army of did you just leave? PASTERNAK: Well, I had, I had a heart problem, and I had they the consul tried to find me everything but they didn’t. They denied that I am that I am dead in there. When the Polish War started I was forced in the Slovak army to go and but the American Consul some how found me and that what I am in the citizens, American citizen and was consulate or a consul and so for help they find me and. WATERS: So your father went to the American Consul to look for you is that? PASTERNAK: No, no the consul themselves my father just contacted the, the consul and at that time it was in Prague yet, later on it that’s why I came the other way because Germany closed the border. Czechoslovakia but actually called the heart of Europe because it was middle Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Romania so, actually from there. WATERS: So, from? PASTERNAK: We supposed our father, our father send us the paper to first the to go through France but because the German border was closed so we couldn’t go there so he had to send us paper through ah, through ah, through Italy to come and actually, I was a deserter at that time because I just went to Italy and there waited to the papers come and than my mother and sister they also came. My father changed the passport and all the visa, visa for the there from there we went and that was originally supposed to have been Conte Savoia which was a very big, big boat forty-seven thousand tons instead of that they put us on the Saturnia and which later on the United States had a grabbed ah’ SIGRIST: Oh, I know how to spell it I know the ship yes (He laughs) PASTERNAK: So, so the problem with me was I couldn’t the papers were sent through going through Hungary and Italy wait for the papers but I had to I had to go through the Hungarian I mean the Slovak to Hungarian border and over there I, I was smuggled in which was some, some people that they still tried to help what ever they could do and the boat just across the border to Hungary. If I had run the other way, they would have grabbed me and at that time already America didn’t started it’s the Slovaks and the Hitler, the Germans that was the and then, then it came to actually came the day we had to go through the train and to the boat and boat that it. WATERS: How, how did they smuggle you into Hungary? PASTERNAK: It was I came on a boat through the Danu, Danu Danube that’s between, separated Slovakia with Hungary a little boat just took me right through even they didn’t take no money even though if they would have caught me they could have been killed too, but once we had all the paper to go through Hungary into Italy and over there in Italy we waited until the papers came and then did this instead, until getting on the Saturnia I mean Conte Savoia a big boat they put on Saturnia which was a small boat seventeen thousand or fifteen thousand under a light almost two thousand people. WATERS: So. PASTERNAK: I can’t even think of this it took us eight, eighteen or twenty days coming from Italy to the United States. WATERS: How did you get to Italy from Hungary? PASTERNAK: That once we got to Hungary we had, we had all papers, we had all the papers, but only on the Borderline we would have gone the way it was on the train they stopped all the trains and I they would grabbed me like that once I was, I was already Hung, Hungary. The only bad thing that was instead of the Conte Savoia they put us on the Saturnia and. WATERS: And, and you met, you met your mother and your sister in Hungary than. PASTERNAK: No, yeah, yeah. WATERS: Do you remember where you left from in Italy? PASTERNAK: I think Naples but that was also supposed to have gone with train, with train and from there right from the boat but instead that the ship was put us on a train and go back I think Naples. WATERS: Do you, How did you feel when you were leaving the country? Were you happy? PASTERNAK: Of course, I was, of course I never expected that ah, be lucky enough that way but my mother still, my mother and sister still went to the train to Budapest, Hungary but I just, I just met them there from Budapest they packed what ever it was, it was most of it was stolen anyhow so, practicing nothing because it was supposed to been stamped everything closed but there were plenty thieves. WATERS: Okay, um how was it decided that just you and your sister were going to come and your brother and your sisters were still gonna stay? PASTERNAK: The couldn’t be brought only on a quota and for the already there was a borderline between Slovakia and Bohemia in which Prague was the consul but then, then when started all the trouble so it was ah, it was no consul in Prague you had to got to, got the papers were made but, but my mother and my sister was no problem but if I would have gone with the train I would have been. WATERS: You said most of your stuff was stolen but do You remember, maybe what was packed for you to come? PASTERNAK: Lot of things, I, I, I remain just with one suit and, and, and one coat and maybe a couple a couple. It was, it was a lot of things packed there silverware and goldware and it was supposed to be actually by government stamped and not supposed to be opened just when it comes but ah, the just saying everybody tried to grab what ever they could. WATERS: Okay, Do you remember what day you left to go to America? Do you remember the date? PASTERNAK: That, that it was very early in December very early I, I don’t all I know is they took us, took us to get to, to New York eighteen, eighteen or twenty days. WATERS: Did you make, Did you make any other stops on the way or you just came straight to America? PASTERNAK: Well, the, the, the boat, the boat made, made straight but we had some problem on the go, it was very stormy and the boat was rocking and everybody was sick, the food was horrible and, my mother and my sister, they sick. Money was they allowed for three of us ten dollars so, and it was only on the boat two, two guys, waiters that were sorry and they felt sorry for us and they give some food, that they. WATERS: Do you remember what class that you traveled on? PASTERNAK: That was the, they were ah supposed to have gone on the first class but on the Saturnia because all the people were there all this for the actually, from the, from our windows you could see, see the sea but we were three still at three, three more completely in the sea. WATERS: Do you remember why, the ships got changed on you? Do you know why that happened? PASTERNAK: Why just yes, because they just tried to ship, ship out everybody and it was on the boat very bad the captain was very anti-semetic he was Bulgarian of course they were friendly Jews and I was hungry I used to, used to used to go my mother couldn’t eat they just anything it was the only, only thing was the Italian wine, which was very good for seasickness, that helped with me but otherwise. WATERS: So, is that what they gave everybody Italian wine to help with their seasickness? PASTERNAK: They, that you could have plenty but the, the bad part was that my mother and sister didn’t want eat only kosher so they gave us kosher food but what a tuna fish in the morning, tuna fish in the am it’s bad enough the, the way it is so you eat it so I used to sneak up on, on, the first and used to steal the fruit or whatever I can and I and the when the captain came he was very anti-semeitic ‘stinking, stinking Jew’ this and this started what. WATERS: So did he keep the Jewish people separated on the ship or? PASTERNAK: Well, he couldn’t separate the, the first class but he put the Jew people mostly on the wherever on the higher on the other put three more of course, on a seventeen thousand ah or instead of forty-seven thousand tons of course, the ship was three quarters when we came to what’s the we made one stop from Naples and I can’t think now big, big ah, big city I can’t remember how from there I was a smooth ride up till the but once, but once we left the gave us very good, terrific meal, that time and but soon we as left, the next day from there it started to storm and we were just. (Intercom voice in background of tape) WATERS: Do you remember where you slept on the ship? PASTERNAK: Yeah, we had very small bunks three people, three people in a cabin but that’s like, you have like children also who have this SIGRIST: Bunkbeds. PASTERNAK: Bunk, but yeah, but believe it or not this was so actually when you slept, you couldn’t sleep like this. (Mr.Pasternak gestures with his hand how he slept) WATERS: You had to sleep on your side PASTERNAK: On our side, and beside you couldn’t sleep an of because it was so stormy and the that we had another thing happen that we were stopped before we came to. WATERS: You were stopped before you came to America. PASTERNAK: Yeah, we were stopped by, we all thought it was German, German but it happened to be a French, France U-boat came but nobody they didn’t make announcement or anything but the Captain and three more people went, went on the boat and they went away with. They didn’t say why or, or what so everybody start to cry and this and I me like a dope went up on the, on the top of the boat never seen before but all suddenly two, two U-boats from one from and back and they, they stopped and came up on the boat, the uniform, the French uniform was the same like Germany so everybody, start to hide and cry. I said, ‘Oh were gonna, the boat they are going to kill us’ all, all this but they came up on the boat and started to go around asking questions they, they speak to me also, not everybody in German, and they started to call name, names to come up to see the captain and wait my name is Pasternak there was one guy there with the name Pearlstin and when they come to me he says, ‘yeah’, the Captain says, ‘yeah he’s, that’s him’ because they took all our passports before we never got, got a passport till when we came to the United States so, he didn’t like me and this he wanted if I should take me off the boat and but, but, they didn’t because I said my name is Pearlstin, not Pearlstin, Pasternak. WATERS: So did they take anyone with them? PASTERNAK: Yeah, they did they were a lot of, a lot of people well, well with a [Christ] on and they, they went around but when they stop they hide or took off their the flag whatever and, yeah they took about twenty some odd people. All because, the one of the officers talk to me in German he says, ‘ we just trying to find out because lot of lot Nazis and Germans try to come on’ and so he just tried so they took him off and they said they took them to a jail and over from there I was friendly with one guy he spoke to me in my own language I, I don’t know if he was one of the Germans to or not but they took him off and he was talking to me,’if we get stopped or anything, anything’ he says, ‘they join the English army’ but I never seen him after that but he was one of them that I knew that was taken of an, and, and I said before to go on a thing before I had never seen a U-boat even in the army because Czechoslovakia didn’t have any, only the Danube was but, it was U-boat can be so, me like dope I’m looking there and there everybody hide and everybody cried and everybody.

WATERS: What was your first job when you came to America? PASTERNAK: For awhile, I couldn’t for months 1940 was like a depression I had no jobs, I know even my cousins, they couldn’t get jobs. One was a professional plumber and he as collecting fifteen dollars but my first job was the, they send me to, to at that time, they Horn and Hogs restaurants you don’t remember, that even in New York they were Horn and Hogs the food was cheap, good food and cheap so, they send me there at that time minimum was was twenty-cent. WATERS: What did you have to do at your job? PASTERNAK: I had to clean, clean the tables and take, and take off the food and was hungry they didn’t, didn’t tell me I could eat so there was one manager there that went after, after me and started on oh sitting your sitting you not doing nothing so, he got me very mad I was hungry I couldn’t go eat or anything so, when he came out, came again, I picked up the food from the plate there it right in his face, you can have your job for twenty-cents I mean. Even though figured out in Czechoslovakian money was, it was pretty good because Amer, American dollar was big but then, then I have very hard jobs. I had no profession so actually anything. HIAS used to send you out at that time, my father used to give me one dollar for, for the carfare at that time carfare straight five cents and go look for a job, look and they didn’t like me because I was very much, because I was very religious the way he wanted me so, was a struggle too. SIGRIST: (addressing Mr. Pasternak) Can I just ask a question the HIAS sent you out, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right can you, can you just say what they sent you out for, when you say they sent you out? PASTERNAK: They send me out, that time send me out on a job but to a furrier. I knew little but so, they send me out for a eight dollar a week and ten, ten hours a day a not was, Saturday no, but six days a day so I came there by that time somebody else because everybody looked for a so, we used to talk together so, when I got my job it took quite a long time before. I so if he ask me I didn’t think that it was going but he ask me oh you got where are you going so, looked for the address and he went down there he didn’t know anything about it but he wanted a job and I came there it was well he says, I have somebody already, somebody came so, my friend who supposed to have been friend and he took it took the, took the job some Americans told me that he don’t, doesn’t want me. SIGIRST: (addressing Ms. Waters) I’m sorry Stacey I didn’t mean to interrupt but, I, I wanted to hear more about that. PASTERNAK: So, it was, it was very hard they would give you HIAS house may a sandwich but not much mostly, eight dollars for eighty hours that’s in actuality was, otherwise employment agency used to send me but, but being that I didn’t work on Saturday so, if I, I did get a job already didn’t come Saturday they told, they don’t need me here till, till finally someone, the first one, one year or two years I was smoking and my father was against smoking so, he gave me when I came here he gave me fifty cents so, of course, I at that time I bought the pack of cigarettes eight cents so, so of, lot of money so, went to, so when fifty cents, I used up mostly for cigarettes and my father told me you want a cigarette the, than you get, the when you work you get money than, my money you wont’ smoke. Being, not having a trade was hard. WATERS: Did your mother or your sister work?
