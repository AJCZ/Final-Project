SCHMIDT:Tell them, they came und got me und came to America. LEVINE:I see. So what was this aunt’s name, the one where you learned German? What was her name? SCHMIDT:I don’t know. She is dead now long ago. They wasn’t so nice to me. LEVINE:No? SCHMIDT:One time my mother wrote them a letter because the neighbors wrote her that I don’t get treated so nice. Mostly him.

LEVINE:Now what your mother’s idea that you would, that you should learn German before you came to America? SCHMIDT:Well, because she thought here in America it’s better German than Hungarian, you know. She wanted me to learn both Hungarian and German. LEVINE:Did your mother know German? SCHMIDT:Oh, yeah. Yeah. LEVINE:Now, did you write to your mother back and forth? SCHMIDT:Yeah, I little bit. My aunt always wrote mostly. They was afraid I maybe write something, but the neighbors did. she laughs LEVINE:Uh-huh. SCHMIDT:Und you know, my mother bought, paid, bought for me for my aunt, but they wasn’t too nice. Not like my other aunt. LEVINE:After being, after being pampered and spoiled by your other aunt, then you went... SCHMIDT:she laughs Yeah. LEVINE:...to another place. It must have been hard for you. SCHMIDT:My other aunt what brought me here, and my uncle, she was good to me, she loved me like her, if I would be her child. LEVINE:Yeah. SCHMIDT:I think Mother must have been a little jealous. Well, see, I know her better than my own mother. LEVINE:Yeah. Yeah. SCHMIDT:Und when I came here her husband wasn’t too nice. LEVINE:I see. SCHMIDT:I was only fourteen. Then he says, now she is here. Now she has to go to work and pay the, the thing back. I think it was sixty dollar. LEVINE:For the, for the passage? SCHMIDT:Yeah. LEVINE:For the trip. SCHMIDT:It was sixty dollar. That I remember. LEVINE:Now do you remember why you came to this country when you did? SCHMIDT:Well, Mother wanted me then. LEVINE:Uh-huh. And do you remember what you knew about America before you came? SCHMIDT:No. No. They always says, all the, the sidewalks are thing with gold. (they laugh) You know. LEVINE:And did you believe that? SCHMIDT:I did, you know. You know, in town, they’re not so smart then. Now the children are. LEVINE:Yeah. So, so do you remember leaving to come to America? SCHMIDT:A little bit. I remember a lot of train, thing.

SCHMIDT:No. The, yeah, my good one. she laughs LEVINE:Oh, your good one. Oh, good. Oh, you must have been happy then. SCHMIDT:Oh, yeah. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SCHMIDT:Because she took me when my grandmother died, and I was her eye apple. (they laugh) They didn’t have no children, you know, so all her, their love went to me. LEVINE:I see. And this is your Aunt Ilona? SCHMIDT:Ilona, yeah. She died long ago. LEVINE:Okay. So you went probably by train, and, and you, and you went on, the ship was The Cleveland. SCHMIDT:Yeah. LEVINE:You’re not sure where that ship started out from? SCHMIDT:No. That I don’t remember. No. LEVINE:Do you remember about the voyage? What was the voyage like?

We was only the three in, Uncle, Aunt und me. LEVINE:I see. And then do you remember when the ship came into New York? SCHMIDT:No. Because then I think they took us on another ship and took us to Ellis Island. LEVINE:That’s right. Yeah. SCHMIDT:Und they went so fast. Und Ellis Island I remember was a big, big empty thing. Nothing around. Und then we rushed for the, the bus or what, to go to College Point to my mother. LEVINE:So do you remember being examined at Ellis Island? SCHMIDT:What I make? LEVINE:Examined by the doctor? SCHMIDT:No, that I don’t remember. No. LEVINE:No? SCHMIDT:No, because everything... LEVINE:You, it was, it happened very quickly? SCHMIDT:Yeah. Nothing around. Not like now. Oh, my God. And, you know, on Ellis Island all the thing was up, not 1910. We went around from room to room to look where they show things. LEVINE:Uh-huh. It wasn’t like that? SCHMIDT:No. I mean, now we never seen 1910. It was ‘11 there and ‘12, where they show people in Ellis Island. I don’t know what happened to the ‘10. (they laugh) LEVINE:Well, so in other words, that just happened very fast... SCHMIDT:Oh, yeah. LEVINE:...in your memory of Ellis Island. So then did anybody meet you at Ellis Island? SCHMIDT:No. Aunt und Uncle, because he was here once in America, too. He was working here. Then after which came, brought me and his wife, my aunt, here. LEVINE:I see. And then you took, to get to College Point, New York, you took something. A train... SCHMIDT:A bus. LEVINE:...or a bus.

See, he went to school, but they didn’t let me go to school. I had to go to work. LEVINE:So when you first got there, do you remember anything that struck you as very different about this country? When you first... SCHMIDT:No, I didn’t go there, because right away look for a, a little housegirl, you know. LEVINE:You were looking for a job... SCHMIDT:I had to work.

Well, is there anything else that you can think of that you’d like to say before we close? SCHMIDT:Oh, I’m just a happy-go-lucky. Und God loves me because he doesn’t want me up there yet.

SCHMIDT:Und then when we went to Ellis Island, when my daughter und son-in-law took, oh, boy, we walked that out. Well, of course, I had to be in wheelchair. I couldn’t walk too far, you know. We went all over. LEVINE:How did you feel seeing... SCHMIDT:Oh, good. I said, ‘Ah,’ opened my mouth, and look how beautiful. LEVINE:Uh-huh.

LEVINE:...and started all over again. SCHMIDT:And we looked all over them pictures of what they have up in each room. But it’s, it’s so hard to get in with the wheelchair, because it’s so many people, you know. LEVINE:Yeah. Yeah. SCHMIDT:But I enjoyed it. LEVINE:Well, good. SCHMIDT:Nobody took me there.

Christmas und New Year’s und so. But my other daughter, the youngest one, they lived, I lived downstairs und they lived upstairs. So actually I brought them up. LEVINE:Uh-huh.
