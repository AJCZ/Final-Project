 kate: 	good evening, this is kate moore for the national park service and today is the 12th of july, 1994 and i'm in pocatello, idaho at the home of christ christ who came to the united states from greece in 1919 when he was 4 years old. why don't you begin by giving us your full name and date of birth please?

christ: 	i don't remember really but it must have been something like farming because it was in the valley that stretched out from the town. it was not too far from a bay where they did some fishing so fishing might have been the second industry. kate: 	what was your father's name? do you remember? christ: 	my father's name was harry halamandaris and he had to change his of course to harry christ. kate: 	why did he pick christ? harry: 	he picked christ because halamandaris- when he came here to the united states, when he came to the port of entry they told him that halamandaris was too long and how do you spell it and naturally my dad was not speaking english, so he thought he would change it to a shorter name and he thought of his father whose name was christ so he just said christ. so his name became harry christ. kate: 	what was his occupation back in greece? christ: 	i don't know. he was telling me once that he did do a little clerking in the grocery store and that the owner would put nickels and dimes here and there and if my father swept the floor and he didn't pick them up and give them to the owner then the owner would know that he put him in his pocket and he would naturally be fired for doing that [laughter]. kate: 	clever. remember what your father looked like, could you describe him? christ: 	my father was 5"8 about 190 pounds, he was very strong. when he came to the united states he would take a spike about 7 inches long and half inch or 3/8 inches think and he would put it in his two hands and bend it to a u. no kidding he was strong [laughter]. kate: 	what about his personality and temperament. christ: 	yeah, his personality was very level. he never did get angry except that he would curse me out when i came in after 9 o'clock in the evening [laughter]. he said 9 o'clock is it then when i came in little a late he bind me [unclear 00:05:17], he would say, "get to bed [laughter]." kate: 	is there a story about your father that you associate with your childhood?

christ: 	not very good except that there was an oblong table and before i went to bed my mother would go into sort of a cellar where we had great big barrels of wine and i’m sure that the barrel stood 8 foot because that was clear up to the ceiling and i would go and i'd say, "[unclear 00:10:41]" right there where this [unclear 00:10:45] and my mother would fill up a glass of wine and i'd take it to the table and drink it, practically every night [laughter]. kate: 	do you remember any playmates? christ: 	yes, i remember two playmates. i had one playmate was [unclear 00:11:18] and he was from turkey and then there was another little girl and she was practically next door and we would play outside. we'd dig up like youngsters like to do. run across nails and pieces of wood and this and that [laughter]. kate: 	what about your grandparents? were you particularly close to your grandparents? christ: 	no. kate: 	did they live nearby? do you know? christ: 	i don't think i had any grandparents. kate: 	what about religious life then? did you go to church as a child? christ: 	yes, i did. my mother and i would go to church quite a bit.  she would ask i remember that she would ask me to pick up a stone and she would pick up a stone and we'd walk up the hillside to the church and then she’d tell me to throw it down into this sort of a ravine and i asked her why we did that and she said that the people of that town wanted the ravine to be filled so that it would give them a little more space near the church [laughter]. kate: 	did you learn prayers at home before you went to sleep? christ: 	yes, my mother would always have me say some little prayer before i went to bed. kate: 	how about before meals? christ: 	well, i imagine but i really don't recall that. kate: 	and the denomination- what religion were you?

did you go to school? you were too young? christ: 	i didn't go to school until i came to the united states. kate: 	do you remember any games that you played in greece as a child? christ: 	no, i don't. i was too small. kate: 	okay, let’s talk about how you got to the united states, who came first? christ: 	okay, my father came to the united states about 1906, he landed in pittsburgh, he worked there for a while and then he came to idaho and he and his brother started farming and then in 1912 my father took off, he went to greece and he fought in the turkish war when greece liberated itself from turkey.  they were under turkish rule for some 400 years until that war and then my father came home after the war to lemnos, he married my mother, he lived there for six or seven months and then he came back to the united states. my uncle in lemnos at the same time when i was born, he baptized me when i was three days old and then he came to the united states to join my father and my father and he went into the farming business then my father became a section foreman and in 1919 i came to the united states with my mother, my aunt and my cousin- four of us. kate: 	to go back a bit, what did your father do in pittsburgh? what work did he first find in the united states? christ: 	he worked in the steel mill. kate: 	in pittsburgh? christ: 	in steel mill in pittsburgh. kate: 	do you know what he did in the steel mill? christ: 	no, i don't. kate: 	alright, so leading up to this when you came over, your father then came here, came home married your mother, came back to idaho? christ: 	hmmm. kate: 	okay, so do you remember packing to come to the united states? christ: 	i don't remember packing. i guess my mother did all the packing. the only thing i remember on the way to the united states was that my mother and i rode on the donkey and we were going, walking on a path, going to the harbor to get onto the ship. kate: 	and do you know what the ship's name was? christ: 	no [laughter]. kate: 	alright, do you know what month it was? christ: 	no, i don't. kate: 	okay, so your mother and you went on a donkey and you walked to the harbor? christ: 	yeah, we were on a donkey and we rode to the harbor, we got on to the ship and took off. kate: 	do you remember the ship, what it looked like? christ: 	no, i don't. i don't remember the ship. kate: 	do you remember being on the ship? christ: 	i remember one thing and that is that when we were on the second ship after leaving athens, we were on the second ship. a german submarine came up and the captain of that german submarine called us, called our captain of the ship and he asked what we were loaded with and the captain told him we had nothing but passengers who were going to the united states.  the german captain said, "no, you must have ammunition, you must have guns and things like that." and our captain answered him that the world war had ended and he should go back home and the german did not believe him and he send a torpedo and hit our ship and i recall that everybody was screaming and yelling and running around and they would get into the life boats. they take this axes instead of lowering the life boats down, they would take and chop the rope so naturally one side of the ship would go down first and everybody would fall out of the boats into the ocean and my mother saw that so she told my aunt, she says, "let’s not get into the boat and tell either the captain or some of his crew get into a boat and we'll go with them."  so that’s what we did, we entered the boat and we were lowered safely down and then another ship had come along and picked us up and i remember that i was on the shoulders of the men and we were climbing this big rope ladder up into this other ship then we continued from there on with our trip to the united states.  i recall the voyage was not very peaceful, we had a few days- three or four days where the ocean was real rough and everybody was sea sick but when the ocean did settle down, this one day i looked out and there were dolphins, 6 or 8 foot tall, i mean long and they were jumping.  they would make big 8 or 10 foot jumps up in the air and come down and as far as i could look around, there were that many dolphins, thousands of them. when we came into the port of entry in ellis island. kate: 	hold on for a second, we go back. christ: 	okay, alright. kate: 	then you had the germans submarine incident, where was that? christ: 	it was in the mediterranean ocean. kate: 	right, that was in the mediterranean ocean, so you were saying. christ: 	between athens and morocco gibraltar somewhere. kate: 	okay, so that happened there. the rescue ship came and got you and that ship went on to new york. christ: 	right. kate: 	what were the accommodations that you and your mother- you were travelling with you, your mother--? christ: 	my aunt and my cousin. kate: 	where were your sisters? christ: 	oh they weren't born yet. kate: 	alright, i see [laughter]. so you, your aunt, your cousin and your mother. where in the boat did you have accommodations? what class? christ: 	i don't know. kate: 	do you remember how you slept? it would give us an indication, did you have bunk beds or do you remember any of that? christ: 	no, but i think we had bunk beds. i think we had bunk beds but we had to go down from the deck into the kitchen or dining area to have our meals. other than that i just don't remember anything about the beds. kate: 	you remember the food? what about the food? christ: 	no, i don't remember the food either, it must have been pretty good [laughter]. kate: 	or you would remember [laughter]. alright, so you saw the dolphins, it was calmer. christ: 	yes. kate: 	before that were you sick or anybody else sick in your party, from sea sickness? christ:	 well yes, my cousin and i we were both just sicker than hoodouts [laughter] and my mother had a blanket out on the deck and we were lying on deck under the blanket. we were using the blanket for shade and oh we were sick [laughter]. kate: 	did you get to play on deck ever? were there any times it was fun? christ: 	i don't recall [laughter]. kate: 	now you said you came in to new york, what was the first thing you remember after the dolphins? christ: 	coming into new york, i remember that we came into new york but i don't remember anything about ellis island. the only thing i remember was the train, we got onto the train and we headed out west for rupert, idaho. kate: 	do you remember the statue of liberty? christ: 	no. kate: 	and do you not remember anything about the processing of customs in ellis island? christ: 	no. kate: 	you know you went through ellis island? christ: 	yeah. kate: 	because your mom said so? christ: 	because my mother said so and we naturally had to go through ellis island at that time. everybody came in through ellis island. kate: 	okay, so you remember the train and you were bound for where? christ: 	rupert idaho, i don't remember the train except that we were on it and we were supposed to have gotten off at minidoka idaho and instead we stayed on the train because my mother didn't know anything about where she should change trains and naturally she didn't know the english language at all.  so the conductor came back and he noticed that we were still in the train, so he let us ride until we came to a little town in bliss, idaho and he asked us then to get off the train. so we got off at bliss, we entered the depot and we sat down on the bench in the depot and my mother began to cry.  the freight agent in bliss there walks up to her and he started talking to her and i imagine she answered him in greek and it happened that he was italian and he knew greek quite well, so he spoke to her that she should not cry that he had his family upstairs and that we were welcome to come up and spend the night and have food with them and that the next morning he would send the telegram to my father that we were here and we would be on this other train that would go to rupert, idaho and to meet us there.  so this all happened, we got onto the train the next morning, we got to rupert, we got off and then i remember that my father had hay rack with a team of horses and my mother and i were sitting on the big trunk and he was upfront and i asked my mother, i said, "who's that man?" and she says, "that’s your father." that was the first time i had seen my father. kate: 	now was your aunt and your cousin- were they with you at this time? christ: 	no, my cousin happened to get chicken pox and they were held over in new york for a couple of weeks and then they came back later. kate: 	held over where in new york? christ: 	i don't know. kate: 	when did she get chicken pox, on the voyage? christ: 	hmm. kate: 	so was she held in-- christ:	no, he my cousin. kate: 	he, sorry was he held in ellis island then? christ: 	i don't know except that they were not allowed to leave new york. they were quarantined. kate: 	yes, they're quarantined and it’s likely they're at ellis island. one question i have though just out of curiosity, back on that boat trip you had, was anybody hurt during the torpedo and did anybody drown? did anybody get killed? christ: 	there were a lot of people that drowned but there was just one torpedo and it went into the hole of the ship and it just loaded up with water and sank. kate: 	so that ship sank? christ: 	hmmm. kate:	okay, i was just wondering because you were through the narration what happened. so you were lucky, you were the lucky ones? christ: 	yep. kate: 	your father and team horses, what was the address that you were going to? do you know? christ: 	i don't believe that farms have addresses [laughter]. kate: 	you were going to a farm. do you remember what the farm was like, what the conditions? christ: 	it was a 40 acre farm, it had a lot of sand on it and my father didn't really like to stay there and farm it so he left about as soon as my mother and i were settled while he took off and went to work on the rail roads as a section foreman. kate: 	now why did your father originally come here anyway? what was his intent in coming to the united states? christ: 	well i don't imagine. you see greece is very mountainous and occupations there are very minimal. it’s probably either farming or working in a grocery store or cafe or things like that and those are not very profitable unless you have a lot of money and a lot of clientele and my father being in kondia which is a small town and island which is not very prosperous he wanted to get out where he could make some money in the future for himself. kate: 	now when your mother came here and your father came here, tell me how they adjusted, did they learn english? christ: 	my father learned english quite well because he became a section foreman and every night he had to make out a report, so he could write and read english [unclear 00:30:43] very difficult time learning to speak english because my father had just become a foreman and he had now seniority to speak of so he had to take these sections which were out in the sticks like milner and kimima and contact in nevada and little place in novi, idaho. kate: 	okay, we'll take a break and change the tape right now. christ: 	oh okay. kate: 	alright, before the break we had gotten to the house, the farm and you had mentioned the farm that you came to. could you tell me about the conditions on the farm? what was the house made of? what about water and plumbing? christ: 	okay, the farm was a 40 acre farm and the house was a little two room home made of wood. we had a well that you had to pump by hand to get the water up and we had an outhouse with two holes in it and the montgomery ward catalogue in it [laughter]. other than that i don't remember except that we also had a horse and a couple cows and i think my uncle had a couple of sheep too because he never did without sheep and naturally we had chicken. kate: 	and what about lighting? what type of lighting did you have? christ: 	good old coal oil with regular chimney that you put on top of the lamps. kate: 	what about heating the house? christ: 	in the kitchen we had a regular majestic cooking stove but in the other room we had a potbellied stove that had a chimney going straight up and my uncle would use that mostly in the winter time to keep the whole place warm. kate: 	and did your uncle live with you? christ: 	yes, we did for one year. kate:  	for one year and what was your uncle working as? christ: 	on the farm. kate: 	on the farm, what language did you speak at home the whole time? christ: 	we always spoke greek. my cousin naturally he came there too and he and i would always speak greek. my uncle, my dad, my mother, my aunt, everybody was speaking nothing but greek. kate: 	how about neighbors? were there any greeks nearby? christ: 	well, if they were they were about a half a mile or at least a quarter of a mile away and we didn't walk that far [laughter]. kate: 	when you went to school, did you speak english at all? christ: 	no, i didn't. when i became 6 years old, my father had gotten a little section by the name of shilo which is about 18 miles west of pocatello and i went to school there. our school was about 3 miles out from our section house and we had to go by a team of horses pulling a buggy which had sort of a platform on it because it took about 8 or 9 children on it to this school.  my first day the teacher gave me a piece of paper and she wrote something on it and she asked me to write, well i didn't. i didn't know how to write this math’s so i didn't do anything so she came along about when school was over with and she noticed that i hadn't written anything and she asked me to stay in after school. well, the buggy came along, the kids took off, got on to the buggy and i started crying and the teacher saw that i was crying so she motioned for me to go and boy did i ran. i caught that buggy and went home.  that evening, the other children told my father what had happened so he wrote a note to the teacher asking her to let me attend school so that i could learn to speak the english language and that’s what happened. i went to school the first year, learning the english language. kate: 	were you ever teased for being greek? did anyone ever say anything? christ: 	no, i was never teased for being greek. i was taken in as any other youth. kate: 	what was your favorite subject in school then finally? christ: 	geography, history was quite interesting too. kate: 	do you remember any teachers at all, favorite teachers? christ: 	there was a tyson in kimima that taught me when i was in the sixth grade and there was mrs.- i don't recall her name anyway she taught me when i was in 7th and 8th grade then from kimima we moved to shoshone and i ended shoshone there. kate: 	is shoshone in idaho? christ: 	in idaho. its north of twin falls, south of sand valley and i think it was right after christmas when we moved to shoshone and i was in 8th grade and our teacher then was mrs. weatharou. in order to graduate from the 8th grade and enter high school at that time we had to take a state examination and because i was going to a small school where we had 8 grades in one classroom with one teacher we didn't learn too much.  so mrs. weatharou was very concerned about me, she thought maybe i would not be able to pass so that i wouldn't graduate but after taking the exam and the grades came out i came out with an 87 which was one of the higher grades and she couldn't believe it [laughter]. kate: 	when you said your father worked- for the rail road you just said? and he had the assignments where he had housing that came with his job, when you moved was it because of his job that you moved? christ: 	well, he always tried to better himself, he would go from like shilo was right out into the sticks naturally but pocatello was not too far away but he never had an automobile, he never did drive and then he moved to contact, nevada and naturally that was still the worst but he thought he was improving himself but he wasn't. from there he moved to milner, idaho which is between bali and twin falls, they have a dam, they have a nice little school where i attended school in the 3rd and 4th grade and then-- kate: 	what exactly did he do though? when you say that he was working at the rail road? what were his tasks? christ: 	he was a section foreman and in the winter time he would have maybe 4 labors working for him , in the summer time he would have as many as 8 and their jobs was to change rail road’s ties, to see that the rails were level, that they were even.  that is certain width, that they were even in width and that they were level and in the winter time they didn't have too much work to do except keep the switches clean, keep the old snow and ice from the switches because the switches meant that either the trains would go or they would be derailed or stopped. kate: 	now, did you always follow your father wherever his assignment was? christ: 	yes. kate: 	how did this affect your background? christ: 	well, it didn't really affect my background much except that it did bother my mother. every time we moved from one section to another section we had section houses on the railroad and often times the section houses would be quite dirty, the floors would be filthy, they'd be black and often times these same homes had bed bugs and we had to clean everything up and get rid of the bed bugs. it affected my mother in that eventually she got sick and she was going to ogden in utah for 7 years having surgery and i don't really remember just why. kate: 	did your mother or father ever consider going to greece? did they talk about it? christ: 	no, never. kate: 	so they get home sick at all? christ: 	i don't think so because my mother and father- i don't know whether my mother did but my father i don't think had a grandfather living at that time. kate: 	do you think that the life here in this country was what your parents had expected before they left? christ: 	well, my father came here the first time and i imagine he liked it, it was very good for him and he came back to it so i imagine he was happy to be here. kate: 	how about your sisters that were born here, did they speak greek at home too. christ: 	yes. kate: 	so that was the family language the entire time? christ: 	hmm. kate: 	because of your mother primarily? christ: 	my mother, yes. kate: 	tell me what happened with your life, you got into high school. you got an 87 on your 8th grade examination and what happened in your life in terms of your profession? christ: 	my profession? kate: 	yeah, did you finish high school? christ: 	oh yeah. yes, i went to high school, i was very interested in sports. i wanted to go out for football that fall and my dad said, "no, you're too small, you're not even 150 pounds," he says, "so why go out for football when you have fellas out there 160 and 70' or 80 [laughter]". so he didn't let me go out for football in my freshman year.  in my sophomore year however i went out for football and i played in the first game and in high school i played all three years. i had never seen a basketball game. i mean a basketball nor a football as far as that goes until i did get into high school.  in my sophomore year i started playing basketball, in my senior year i made the team and we got along pretty good, we beat boise which was a big school and shoshone the student body was only 124 students in the four grades, so beating boise was quite an accomplishment and we also played boise football at one year and they beat the heck out of us 32-6 and i was the only one who made the touch down and that was a tackle [laughter]. kate: 	then you finish high school, did you? christ: 	yes, i finished high school and i came to pocatello in 1934, that fall i came to pocatello and i have been here practically ever since except for- i don't remember what she was trying to tell me. i came to pocatello in the fall of 1934, i entered college, my father wanted me to become an auto mechanic, well to satisfy him i took auto mechanics that year, i didn't like it. kate: 	what school did you go to? christ: 	here at idaho state, at that time it was called university of idaho southern branch. i went out for sports there too but i didn't do very well, i was too light so i just dropped them. in my sophomore year i met penny at church and i met her along with two or three other girls that were there and we shook hands and introduced ourselves. kate: 	what happened after that? i mean how long did you date? christ: 	well, we really didn't date much because from 35 until 1940 when we were married we just meet once in a while and see each other. we didn't date because her folks were very strict. a matter of fact one day i went over to her home and we took a little walk up to the university and back and her father didn't like the idea of my taking his daughter out for a walk [laughter]. kate: 	how did you know she was the one you were going to marry?

that’s where you have a little note passed between us, how did you propose to her? we're getting notes passed here from family members for those who don't know what’s going in the tape [laughter]. alright, how did you propose to your wife? christ: 	we had a car full of kids, her two brothers and three sisters i think and we took a drive out in the country. we came to steep hill and penny and i climbed this hill and while we were on top of the hill i proposed to her there. kate: 	what hill was that? christ: 	knob hill [laughter]. kate: 	have you ever gone back? christ: 	that was south of town here. kate: 	have you ever gone back? christ: 	no, i don't think we ever went back. kate: 	okay, so you proposed, she accepted. i suppose she's sitting right here. christ: 	yes, she accepted. kate: 	what happened then, you married and you had children, did you have children?

do you think of yourself as american or as greek or as both? christ: 	both, you can't help it but consider being greek because you have other greek people here that speak greek and they go to the greek orthodox church the same as i and i'm in the united states, i'm a naturalized citizen. i vote and i think most for my government and one to another. kate: 	alright, well i'd like to thank you on behalf of ellis island for allowing us to take the opportunity to speak with you and we'll send you a copy of this as well. christ: 	okay, very good. kate: 	this is kate moore signing off on july 12th, 1994 from pocatello, idaho for the ellis island oral history project.
