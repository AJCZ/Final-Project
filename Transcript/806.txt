And you, if you were to tell a story about your father in your childhood that would typify your father, do you have any favorite stories that the family tells about your father? JOCOLA: Well, see, he came to this country right after I was born, six years, at least, before we did. So I never knew him much until we got to the United States. MOORE: And did your mother tell you about your father? JOCOLA: Yeah. He was, he was in the cavalry in the First World War, and that's mostly what she mentioned, him being in the service. He was gone for four or five years there. MOORE: And so when you came to this country for the first time, you had not known . . . JOCOLA: No. MOORE: Did you remember your father at all? JOCOLA: No, see, I was, he came here in 1921, and I was born in 1920. That's all. ( he laughs ) MOORE: And so, when you came here, what did, what was the image you had of your father when you came here, when you expected to see him? JOCOLA: Well, the first time I saw him was at Ellis Island. And, of course, he was only thirty-three, thirty-four years old at that time. And . . .

JOCOLA: Oh, she was about five foot eight, I would say, about a hundred and sixty pounds, sixty-five pounds, brown hair. She had a mole right here in the lower eye. ( he gestures ) Outside of that, just a . . . MOORE: And what type of temperament or personality did she have? JOCOLA: Oh, she was, she was more demanding and a little stricter than my father was. ( she laughs ) MOORE: What about, what chores around the house did she, was she responsible for then? Being a housewife meant what? JOCOLA: Well, cooking, doing all the housework, and that's about it. MOORE: And if you were to tell a story about your mother, something that she had done that you remember, what would you say? JOCOLA: Well, I knew her, she lived to be over ninety, and there's a lot of years there, so many different things. MOORE: As we go through this, do you ever think of a story that you tell? JOCOLA: No, nothing that really stands out, you know. MOORE: All right. Your brothers and sisters, did you have any? JOCOLA: No sisters, two brothers. MOORE: Two brothers. And what were their names? JOCOLA: One was James, and one is Martin. MOORE: Martin, James and Martin. And those were their full names. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: And when were they born, where are you in relation to them?

JOCOLA: In the United States, that's right. MOORE: All right. Now, going back to when you lived in Italy, describe what you remember about the house. Now, you're very small, so it's a small boy's recollection, but what do you remember? JOCOLA: Well, like I say, when I come back, I really, I remember quite a bit of it. The houses there were all built of natural stone, and this was four, I'd say a five-room house. And I remember in one corner of the kitchen they had an oven, an oven where they'd bake their bread in there. The floors were all, not stone, but mosaic-like, you know. And a big cellar underneath there. MOORE: Did you have a garden? JOCOLA: Well, the gardens, they had gardens but they were spread out. They weren't connected to the house, but they had different tracts of land here and there in the valley there, see. MOORE: And how was it heated, your house, do you remember? JOCOLA: A big fireplace. MOORE: By a central fireplace. Which was . . . JOCOLA: In the kitchen. MOORE: In the kitchen. What about, how was the house lit? JOCOLA: I remember there was electricity there. MOORE: So you had electricity. JOCOLA: Yeah, we had electricity. MOORE: And you talk about the cellar, what was in the cellar? JOCOLA: Well, my grandfather kept a mule in there, I remember that. And he, a lot of, they had, he had a vineyard, and he made wine and kept that under there, too. MOORE: So your grandparents, was the vineyard for income, or was it only for family consumption, that you had? JOCOLA: Both. MOORE: Both. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, because they, he had an orange grove, too, and that was practically all a cash crop, the oranges. MOORE: What type of wine was it? JOCOLA: Well, it was both red and white. I remember that. MOORE: And the names of the white? Do you remember? JOCOLA: The white was what they call muscatel. I don't know about the red. The red had, I suppose it had a name, but I don't quite remember it. MOORE: And what about the furniture in the house? Do you remember? JOCOLA: It was, compared to what we have, it was simple furniture, you know, mostly homemade, from what I remember. MOORE: And the house, you said, was it, to go back a bit, was it inside or outside the town? Is it in the town itself proper? JOCOLA: Oh, it was in the town, yeah. MOORE: So, did you have any animals at all? JOCOLA: Uh, they had goats there, too. My grandfather had goats. MOORE: Now, you say your grandparents. Your grandparents lived with you? JOCOLA: Uh, my mother, on my mother's side, we lived with them, I would say. MOORE: So it was your mother's family's house? JOCOLA: Yeah. Well, my father was here, see. MOORE: I see. So your father married, came to the States, and you lived with the mother's family. JOCOLA: That's right. MOORE: All right. So basically you knew your grandparents. JOCOLA: Oh, yes. MOORE: And they helped raise you. JOCOLA: And my mother's brother, I remember, well, when we went back he was still alive then. MOORE: And was the family house still there? JOCOLA: Yeah. Oh, yeah, still there. ( he laughs ) MOORE: Who did the cooking in your family at that time? JOCOLA: My grandmother. MOORE: Your grandmother. JOCOLA: And my mother, I suppose, too. MOORE: And what was your favorite food, as a child there, do you remember? JOCOLA: We had spaghetti a lot of times. ( they laugh ) Yeah. MOORE: And that was your favorite? JOCOLA: That would have to be, yeah. MOORE: ( she laughs ) Did you ever help cook? JOCOLA: No. MOORE: No. And did your father ever help cook? JOCOLA: Not that I know of. See, I wasn't . . . MOORE: I mean your grandfather, sorry. JOCOLA: No. He strictly worked the fields. MOORE: And what was a meal like, mealtime like at home? Did you have, how many meals a day did you have? Did you eat together, or not? JOCOLA: Well, together it was in the evening when all the people come in from the fields, you know. And, of course, we had lunch between, around noontime as far as, that's about all I remember of that. MOORE: And the table were, your immediate family, and were there, was there anybody else at mealtime? JOCOLA: Only on certain occasions when we had guests. Mostly it was just the family. MOORE: What about your family members, your mother's family or your father's family? Did they live nearby? JOCOLA: Yes, they did. Just, I would say, right around the corner from there. MOORE: And who was they? Was that your mother's family? JOCOLA: No, my father's family. See, we lived with my mother's family. My father had a brother and two sisters in the same town, I'd say about two blocks from where we lived. MOORE: So did you know your father's parents, your grandparents? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, oh, yes. MOORE: So you visited them. JOCOLA: Oh, yes. MOORE: What were your grandparents' names, do you remember, on your mother's side? JOCOLA: On my mother's side? My grandfather was Eugene, and my grandmother was Domenica. MOORE: Domenica. And your father's parents' names? JOCOLA: Uh, Michael. I was named after him. And, gee, my grandmother, I don't remember her first name. ( he laughs ) MOORE: Do you remember her maiden name, your father's mother's maiden name? ( Mr. Jocola pauses ) It could come back to you later. JOCOLA: No. MOORE: It may come back to you later, just for record's sake because we write this all out. JOCOLA: No, I don't. MOORE: All right. To whom were you most, were you closest in the family, would you say? JOCOLA: Well, besides my mother would be her brother and my grandfather and grandmother. MOORE: Her brother, so that those people who were in the immediate household. Was her brother living with you? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, yeah. He was, he was just a teenager when we left, you know. MOORE: And did you maintain contact, then? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. My mother wrote back and forth all the time. MOORE: Do you remember your father's, your grandparents' on your father's side house? Do you remember that, down the street? You said you went to . . . JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, it was about the same type as where we lived. They were all stone homes. MOORE: And what did your grandparents do for a living? JOCOLA: My grandfather on my father's side was, he dealt more with animals than he did with agriculture. MOORE: And what type of animals? JOCOLA: Uh, cattle and sheep and goats and things like that. MOORE: And did he have a vineyard as well? JOCOLA: Yeah, he still had, they still had gardens, sure, because they raised most of their own food, yeah. MOORE: Do you remember any, this is some sort of artificial way of asking, but I'm asked to ask you about anecdotes about family members when you were little. Do you remember anything, what sticks out in your mind when you were eleven years old? JOCOLA: Oh, well, my father, my grandfather on my mother's side was known as a jack-of-all-trades in the village. He was in demand for all odd jobs. They'd all come to him. MOORE: Like what types of things? Like, for instance? JOCOLA: Well, he used to trim vineyards, you know, and if you had anything to do with animals or carpentry work, almost anything. He was, like I say, he was known as a jack-of-all-trades out there. MOORE: And did he work a lot? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. He was always busy. MOORE: And your grandmother, in terms of being a part of this farm, was she as hardworking in terms of what was required of her as . . . JOCOLA: Well, mostly she took care of the house. MOORE: What about your, how could you speak about your father's parents? Do you remember any anecdotes about them, or . . . JOCOLA: No, not, not really. MOORE: All right. ( she refers to her papers, and a rustling sound is heard on the tape ) Oh, yeah. What was religious life like in Italy when you were a child? JOCOLA: Religious? Well . . . MOORE: Or was there any? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. There was two churches in the town, and one was nearer to the village, to our home, where we lived than the other one, and that's where we went. Most of the people went there every Sunday. MOORE: And what denomination was that? JOCOLA: That was the Roman Catholic there. MOORE: And did you have your First Communion? JOCOLA: Yes. MOORE: In Italy? JOCOLA: Yes, in Italy. MOORE: And how, could you describe that? JOCOLA: No. ( he laughs ) I don't remember. MOORE: What age do you think that was? JOCOLA: Uh, gee, it would have to be, I don't remember, so it must have been five, four, something like that. MOORE: How close was the church to your house? JOCOLA: Oh, in terms of what we would say here, about three blocks, I would say. MOORE: And did, what did the church look like? Do you remember that? JOCOLA: Oh, it was, it dated back, they had records to the thirteenth century, and when we were there the last time in 1959 they had to tear it down because it was ready to collapse. But they told us that they had records of that dating to the thirteenth century. MOORE: And how would you describe it? JOCOLA: It was a big stone building, like it was built by hand. Well, it probably was, it had to be. But inside, outside it didn't look like anything, but inside it was all decorated up. MOORE: Do you remember any marriages when you were a child, that you attended? JOCOLA: Very faintly, it, amarriage, during a marriage there, I guess it was like a holiday, you know, in the village, and I remember people dancing and things like that, music. MOORE: So you must have, you think you attended a wedding? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, but it, it's real faint, a real faint memory. MOORE: In the home, how did your religion have any affect on your home life? What holidays were the biggest holidays for you, or how did you worship, as such? JOCOLA: Well, Christmas was the biggest, the big holiday there, just like everywhere else, I would say. Like I remember my grandmother and mother both, they went to church real regularly. MOORE: And what does that mean, real regularly? JOCOLA: Regularly, I meant. MOORE: Yeah, but, how often? JOCOLA: Every Sunday, and sometimes in the evenings they would go, too. MOORE: On Sunday evening, or during the day? JOCOLA: During the week on the evenings, during the week. MOORE: Were you taught prayers to say? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. MOORE: Or evening prayers? JOCOLA: Yes. MOORE: Do you remember any evening prayers? JOCOLA: No. ( he laughs ) MOORE: Back to Christmas, what would be a Christmas celebration at your household there? JOCOLA: Well, compared to what we do here it was real tame, I'll tell you. It was strictly religious, not commercial, no commercial there. MOORE: And so that meant what? So, for a little boy, what did you do? JOCOLA: Well, we, I remember the, uh, the big log on the fireplace there during Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was actually the big, the big. And there was presents, simple presents, toys passed around and things like that. But, like I say, there, no commercial there like here. MOORE: What about for children? Was there an equivalent to Father Christmas or St. Nicholas? JOCOLA: Father Christmas, I believe it was. MOORE: And so . . . JOCOLA: And they had this other custom that shepherds would come in with, with a type of a horn, you know, a musical thing. They'd come in the town there Christmas Eve. They'd play all through the town. I remember that. MOORE: And what about the food, what type of Christmas food? JOCOLA: Well, they had the best that they could afford then. That's . . . MOORE: Which was . . . JOCOLA: Well, I remember a lot of different fruit, a lot of fruit, yeah, and candies, chocolates, things like that. MOORE: ( she laughs ) All right. What about Easter? You also celebrated . . . JOCOLA: Easter was another big, in fact, I'd say Christmas and Easter were the only two I recall, yeah. MOORE: And you exchanged gifts at Christmas. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: And did you have, does Father Christmas bring gifts, or was it from the parents? JOCOLA: It was from the family members ourselves. MOORE: You were very small. Did you attend any school system? Did you go to school in Italy? JOCOLA: Yes, I, well, I'd just started. I remember I learned to write my name. That's, see, we started at, I had, I would say, about one semester of school there. And I had, I had never, I didn't learn to read the language, you know, read or write it. But I do remember I learned to read, to write my name. MOORE: And where was the school that you went to, do you remember? JOCOLA: In a neighborhood right there. MOORE: So you walked. JOCOLA: Oh, yes, every day. MOORE: And was it a crowded school? What was attendance? What were the classes? JOCOLA: Oh, I remember a lot of boys there. In fact, it was all boys, yeah. Girls had to, see, our school would be public school where the boys were, and the girls went to a church school there. MOORE: And what about playmates or teachers? Do you remember any? JOCOLA: Well, I remember the teacher because I met him again when I went back. Yes, he was well-known there. MOORE: What was his name? JOCOLA: I, what the heck was his name? I can't recall right now. MOORE: We'll get back to it. What about school friends, or playmates? Did you have any? JOCOLA: Yeah, because I looked them up when I went back. ( he laughs ) MOORE: So you're still in contact with the kids you grew up with. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. MOORE: All right. I suppose you have to be older to ask you if you had any favorite subject in school? JOCOLA: No. MOORE: You were only there one semester. JOCOLA: Like I say . . . MOORE: Um, the question of language, knowing that you're coming to the United States at one point, did you know any English before you came? JOCOLA: No. MOORE: And did your mother know any English? JOCOLA: No. MOORE: Do you know whether your father knew any English before he came? JOCOLA: Yes, he probably did, because he was in the service for five or six years, and they had the . . . MOORE: In Italy. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: And there he came in contact with English. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. MOORE: Back to when you were a child, what did you do for entertainment at home? JOCOLA: There wasn't much, I'll tell you. ( they laugh ) Most of our entertainment was, well, there was movies, there was outdoor movies. They showed them. And also you made your own entertainment. Boys picked up games, and things like that. MOORE: Do you remember any names of childhood games, or types of games that you played? JOCOLA: That bocci is, that was like football is here. MOORE: So you played bocci. JOCOLA: Bocci, and soccer, too, I guess. I played soccer, yeah. Outside of that . . . MOORE: You don't remember any games on the street? JOCOLA: Well, I remember playing with other boys, but I don't know just what we were playing. ( a telephone rings ) ( break in tape ) MOORE: When you talk to your family about your life in Italy, what you remember, what stories do you tell about it? ( Mr. Jocola laughs ) Or do you tell? JOCOLA: There isn't much to, see, I only remember maybe a year from before we came here back five or six years old. It wasn't, I don't, just like I remember what I've been telling you, just most of it is real faint, you know. MOORE: You were very young, that's right. You remember more than most people do, actually. JOCOLA: Yeah, I do. MOORE: Now, about America, about coming to America and the United States, whose decision was it to come here? JOCOLA: Well, my mother told me this a lot of times. After the war was over, and the people come back from the service, they didn't have much, there wasn't much, no opportunities of any kind in them small villages. And it had been for years before, before my father came here, that the people, as soon as they got a chance, they'd immigrate. So his brother left when he was eighteen years old, and came here. MOORE: And is that the connection, what connection did your father have to the States? How did he get here? JOCOLA: Through his brother, see, his brother had been, he came around 1910, and my father didn't come till about ten, eleven years after that. MOORE: What was his brother's name? JOCOLA: Anthony. MOORE: Anthony. And to get to the States, how did he finance that then? JOCOLA: Well, see, his brother, his uncle, my father's brother, his uncle had been here for years, and that's where he came, so that's when he came here. They all came to this area, right around here. MOORE: To Ohio. JOCOLA: Yeah, to Ohio. MOORE: And what brought them to Ohio, of all places? Do you know? JOCOLA: Well, there were jobs here in the mills, steel mills. MOORE: So they came, let me get this right, now, so I understand. Your father's brother's name is Andrew. JOCOLA: Uh, Anthony. MOORE: Anthony, sorry, Anthony. Anthony came at eighteen years old. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: Now, Anthony came here because he had an uncle? JOCOLA: Yeah, he was here. MOORE: All right. So you had, all right. So your uncle was here. Was he the first in your family? JOCOLA: As far as we know, yeah. He was . . . MOORE: What was his name, do you know? JOCOLA: I don't remember. No, Ferdinand. Ferdinand Modarrelli. MOORE: All right. Modarrelli. Okay. So Ferdinand Modarrelli came here first and, you say, because of the steel mills, you think. JOCOLA: Yeah, there was work here. MOORE: So that your father's mother came here, too. All right. Do you remember about your father, your, any preparation for you and your mother coming to the States? Do you remember the idea coming up, or when did they talk about it, or any of that moment when . . . JOCOLA: Well, they were corresponding by mail, you know. And they talked about it all the time. He, my father, he was working here, and he saved money, and he had a home already built. In fact, it wasn't quite complete when we got here, so we stayed with our uncle for about two weeks while they completed the house there. But they knew all along that they were, that, when he came here that she would follow sooner or later. MOORE: And what did she tell you about America before, when you were a child? Do you remember anything that she told you? JOCOLA: Well, she didn't, she didn't really know anything about it either as far as that goes, see. MOORE: So do you remember when you left what happened before, how you packed anything, what you left behind? JOCOLA: No. Yeah, the big recollection I have is when we climbed that stair from the dock to the ship at Naples. The last thing I saw was my, my mother's brother out on the shoreline there, and that was, I just stood in my mind all the time. And then when we went back in 1960, he was, he was on the dock again waiting for us to embark. ( he laughs ) MOORE: And what about, so, you remember school a little bit, learning to write your name in school. JOCOLA: That's about all I can . . . MOORE: Right. And then you remember walking up those steps. Do you remember anything in between that, anything? What toys you could bring or not bring, or clothing you packed, or things, or . . . JOCOLA: Well, my mother packed everything that we had, practically, and took it. And, but after we got here they, there was a big wooden box that my grandparents shipped over here, but that's about all. MOORE: Do you remember parting from your grandparents? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. We left our village to go to the rail station, which was about ten miles away during the night in order to catch a train to Naples and get to the ship on time. MOORE: Do you remember your mother's reaction to leaving with her parents? JOCOLA: Well, I remember a lot of tears on both sides. That's about it. MOORE: And was your father's family there to say goodbye, too? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. All the, everybody in the neighborhood, actually. MOORE: And they saw you to the train? JOCOLA: No. When we left for the train they were there. MOORE: And how did you get to the train? JOCOLA: Uh, by horse cart. MOORE: Do you remember that ride? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, yeah. MOORE: And so who came in the horse cart with you to the train? JOCOLA: My mother and I were in the cart. MOORE: And who drove. JOCOLA: Uh, my grandfather. MOORE: So, your grandfather. And was your grandmother with you? JOCOLA: No, she didn't go down with us there. MOORE: So that's how you got to the train. Now, on the train to Naples, do you remember that trip? JOCOLA: No, it was during the night. I probably fall asleep, because I don't remember it at all. MOORE: Okay. And the brother went to the boat to say goodbye. JOCOLA: Yeah, he came with us actually, see. MOORE: He was in the cart. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: All right. And did you take, do you remember taking any food with you? JOCOLA: No, no. MOORE: And any special belongings? JOCOLA: All we had, as far as I can remember. MOORE: Do you have any of those things left that you left with? JOCOLA: No, I don't. MOORE: And so what port did you leave from? JOCOLA: Naples. MOORE: Naples, right. And, how, uh, we already talked about that. Once you got to the port, did you have to wait for the ship? JOCOLA: Yes. All, we were there in the morning, and the ship was there, all you had, all the ships left at noon there from Naples. But we got on the ship a few hours before it actually left port. MOORE: And the time between the train and the ship, what did you do? Do you remember? JOCOLA: I don't remember, but I was told that my mother and her brother were, uh, window shopping, I guess you'd call it, in Naples, you know. MOORE: What did you, when did the ship depart? JOCOLA: At noon. MOORE: At noon? JOCOLA: It was in, the exact date I don't have, but we got here the last week in July, and it took seven days to get here, so. MOORE: Now, what do you remember about the ship and the accommodations on the ship? JOCOLA: Well, I remember the cabin. Mother and I were in the same cabin. MOORE: And what deck was that cabin, what class was that cabin? JOCOLA: What they call tourist cabin, tourist class at that time. MOORE: And could you describe that cabin? JOCOLA: Well, it was kind of small, but it had, you'd have to call it bunks, you know, one bed on top of the other. MOORE: And the eating situation that you had, how did you have meals? JOCOLA: We had meals three times a day in the dining room, like a long table. I remember long, sitting at the long tables there. MOORE: And what was the food like? Do you remember lining up for food, or . . . JOCOLA: The first time I tasted ice cream was there. That's what I remember. ( he laughs ) But the food was good. I remember my mother always talking about it. They had everything there. MOORE: Was it crowded, the eating conditions? Do you remember any people scrambling for food, or . . . JOCOLA: No, no. Everything was in order. MOORE: And what about the deck? Were you allowed on deck? JOCOLA: Oh, we were on deck all the time. I remember ( he laughs ) The thing I remember there we, actually, what happened was we passed another ship going in the other direction, and they blew the whistle, and that was the loudest whistle I had ever heard. Boy, that scared me. ( Ms. Moore laughs ) I can still hear that thing. We were on deck all the time, practically. MOORE: Were there other children to play with? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, a lot of them. There were mostly women and children on that ship on that particular crossing. I don't know why, but that's . . . MOORE: Were there, what nationalities predominantly were on the boat? JOCOLA: Oh, they were practically all Italy, I would say. MOORE: So you had other Italian children to play with. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. MOORE: And did your mother keep in contact with any of the other people she met on the boat? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. She, right to the end there. The other woman, the lady there, she got off in New York City, see, and that was the end of that. She never, I don't believe they ever corresponded after that. MOORE: But were there any people on the boat that your mother made friends with? JOCOLA: Only during the trip, for the length of the trip. It took a week, you know. MOORE: And anything happen that you remember that was funny during that voyage? JOCOLA: I got seasick one day. ( he laughs ) I remember that. Outside of that, that's about it. MOORE: Was it a smooth or rough trip? What type of trip was it across? JOCOLA: It was smooth outside of that one day. MOORE: And were other people also sick? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, yeah. Everybody was laying down on the deck, I remember that. ( they laugh ) MOORE: What activities were there on the boat? What type of conditions? Did you have any organized activities? JOCOLA: No, I don't believe. They might have had, but I don't recall. MOORE: Okay. So at one point you saw land. Do you remember it? JOCOLA: The Statue of Liberty. Early in the morning, it was foggy, it was fog, but you could see the Statue real easy. MOORE: And how did you see it? Where were you? JOCOLA: On the deck of the ship there. MOORE: And were there many people there? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. Everybody was there looking for it. MOORE: And what was the reaction at that time? JOCOLA: Well, they, everybody realized that it was the end of the trip, you know. MOORE: What, did you see New York City at all for the first time? JOCOLA: The Battery, right at the tip, the tip of Manhattan. The ship docked there, and then we took, they took a smaller boat from there to Ellis Island. That's the way they worked it then. MOORE: You have a good memory. JOCOLA: Oh yeah, well, I remember that. MOORE: So you got from a small ship to Ellis Island. JOCOLA: Yeah, just. MOORE: Do you remember seeing Ellis Island, your first impression of Ellis Island as you entered it? JOCOLA: No, just, just another, it was a fancy building right there. I remember that part. But it wasn't, it was right on the seashore itself, so that I remember everybody walking from the boat up the steps and into the building there. MOORE: And was it crowded? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. It was mobbed. That big room was all filled with people. MOORE: And what was your mother's feeling about that? Do you remember what she said about that time, arriving? JOCOLA: Well, she was kind of apprehensive about the examination that was coming up. Outside of that, I don't know. MOORE: And do you remember, going back to the examination, do you remember what people were wearing at that time? Do you remember, do you have a visual image of what was the dress? JOCOLA: Well, I remember what I was wearing. We had, in Italy the boys our age wore shorts, like. I remember that. It was, like I say, it was in July, it was warm, but just actually streetwear, everybody. MOORE: Do you remember the conditions at Ellis Island? Were they clean? Were they, was there any impression you had about the facilities in terms of, you know, bathrooms? JOCOLA: Everything, I remember, was clean, real clean. MOORE: All right. So the medical examination. Why was your mother apprehensive about the medical examination, do you know? JOCOLA: Well, she had heard stories that a lot of people were failed and some had to, they sent some back, you know, things like that. MOORE: They did send some back. JOCOLA: Oh, yes, oh, yeah. MOORE: And did you have a medical examination actually? JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: And what did they do? JOCOLA: Well, they said I had a cold of some kind, and that's, so that I had to stay there in the, I guess you'd call it a hospital. They had a hospital there. My mother passed all right, but they wouldn't let, of course, she couldn't go until they, until I got out, and I spent almost a week there. MOORE: In the hospital. JOCOLA: Yeah, in the . . . MOORE: Was your mother with you? JOCOLA: No, no, no. MOORE: So you were separated from your mother? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. See, that's the, she knew what was going on, but I didn't. I remember somebody took me by the hand and went up the steps. ( he laughs ) That's the last I saw of her for about three days. Then they had visiting hours, you know. That's the way it worked out. MOORE: How did you feel about that? JOCOLA: That was the worst part of the trip as far as I was concerned. MOORE: And no one explained to you why? JOCOLA: Well, if they did, I didn't understand it. ( he laughs ) MOORE: I want to change this. Hold on. ( referring to the tape ) END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE JOCOLA: Well, nothing . . . MOORE: Did they check your eyes? JOCOLA: Just a normal, as I know now, just a normal examination. MOORE: But this cold you had, did you have it on the boat, too? JOCOLA: Evidently that's probably where I got it, because we passed examinations in Naples and everything was all right, so naturally we figured, my mother figured that's where I got it during the trip. MOORE: Do you remember your mother's reaction when they informed her that you were going to be detained? JOCOLA: No, she didn't seem too excited, you know, nothing, that's what I couldn't understand, why they just took me and not her, you know. MOORE: And where did she stay during that time? JOCOLA: Evidently they had dormitories for women right there, too. MOORE: So you didn't see your mother for three days. Do you remember any other children that were kept? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. I remember the dormitory was a real long, and you had these white, white single beds lined up on both sides. And after a couple of days, why, we'd go outside. There was a, it looked like a big fish pond there. I looked for it when we got there a couple of years ago, but it wasn't there any more. I don't know what happened to it. But we used to go there, and there was a fellow, a man who worked there, and he was feeding the fish, I remember that. Every day he had a loaf of bread there, and he was throwing food to them. MOORE: So you played with other children? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. MOORE: And do you remember, was this whole dormitory only children? JOCOLA: Yes. MOORE: So the children's hospital. JOCOLA: Evidently it was just for children. They had to have it for adults, too, but I, we never saw. MOORE: What about, what were the other children there for, do you remember? JOCOLA: No, I just took it for granted that we all had the same thing. I don't know. MOORE: And were they Italian, other Italians there? JOCOLA: All nationalities. In fact, the one I made friends with, we couldn't understand each other, but we still went outside together and everything else. MOORE: And so at the end of how long, then, you were separated from your mother? JOCOLA: They said about a week. For the, after a week everything was all right. MOORE: And do you remember seeing your mother for the first time after the three days? JOCOLA: Three days, yeah. MOORE: And she came in? JOCOLA: Yeah. Then she come in another time after that, too. MOORE: So you remember all that. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, naturally. That's why, she wasn't, when this happened that I couldn't come, that I had to stay there, Mother sent a telegram to my father, and he came to New York. And that's, he got there, oh, about two days before, before I was discharged. That's where I, the first time that I actually saw him, right there. MOORE: So you had this rocky road. I mean, first you were taken away from your mom. JOCOLA: Yeah. ( he laughs ) That was, that's the thing that stayed with me. You know, I could remember, in fact, I'll always remember that. MOORE: So you got out, and what happened? How did you get discharged? JOCOLA: Well, I found out later that they wouldn't let any women go out of Ellis Island alone. So that's why my father had to come, and then they, when they, all three of us went to the, we went to that Erie Railroad Station there, and home. MOORE: Now, why do you think they wouldn't let women alone? JOCOLA: I don't know. MOORE: So women had to be escorted? JOCOLA: Yes, with a man, by a man, at that time. Probably need it more now than they did. ( he laughs ) MOORE: Well, all right. So you got out. Your father was waiting for you where? When did you first see your father, your dad? JOCOLA: There was a waiting room on Ellis Island. I don't know where it was, but they took me there to the room and that's where he was. MOORE: Let me backtrack a bit. When you were given food in that hospital, do you remember eating at that hospital? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, yeah. MOORE: How was the accommodations for food and . . . JOCOLA: It reminded me a lot on the way things were on the ship, the same way. Everybody sat on a long table there. MOORE: And they were all children? JOCOLA: Yeah, all children. MOORE: And no one spoke the same language? JOCOLA: Well, I don't remember anybody. I suppose there were others there, but I, there had to be. MOORE: And were there kids crying a lot? Do you remember that? JOCOLA: Yeah, there was a lot of that. I remember that. Because it was probably all the same, the same feelings that I had, you know, the same experience that I had. They probably, I don't remember anybody explaining anything to me, but I would imagine they did, you know. But I, it took me a couple of days to really get used to the idea that I was, I wasn't going to see my mother for a while. MOORE: When you saw your father, what was your first impression of him? JOCOLA: ( he laughs ) We were strangers, that's all. But after that we were always together. MOORE: So you went with him, and where did, you went, the three of you. Was anybody else with him? JOCOLA: No, just by himself. MOORE: By himself. And what happened then? JOCOLA: Well, I don't know how we done it, or what the thing, but we ended up at a railroad station. I believe it was in New Jersey, on the New Jersey side there. MOORE: And then what? JOCOLA: Well, it was an all-night train ride to Niles. I remember getting off the train in the morning. We walked to our house, which was on, say, about a ten minute walk. MOORE: And what was that house like? Describe that. JOCOLA: It was a brand new five-rooms and a bathroom. It was just brand new. It was, it's still there. I lived in, we lived in it. My mother lived there all her life. MOORE: And your father built that house? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. MOORE: What was the address? Do you remember? JOCOLA: Yes. 303 West Federal Street, in Niles. MOORE: West Federal. JOCOLA: West Federal. MOORE: And when you got to the house, did anyone meet you or greet you? JOCOLA: Well, my father's brother, that's where he lived when the house was being built. They lived right across the street from there. That's where we stayed for a couple of weeks while the house was completed. MOORE: When you first came here, do you remember anything you'd never seen before? You said ice cream was the first time you'd eaten that on the boat. JOCOLA: I ate it on the boat. ( he laughs ) Bananas. We didn't know, I didn't know bananas, and I couldn't eat them. ( Ms. Moore laughs ) I don't know why, I can eat them now, but I couldn't eat them at that time. And my cousins, they gave me a banana, they followed me around, because they knew that I wouldn't eat it. ( they laugh ) I remember that. MOORE: Anything else, do you remember? How about . . . JOCOLA: Well, the language. That's, you know. We, that was, I had cousins where we lived that were almost my age, but they didn't speak Italian either because their mother was born here, and they only spoke English. So I didn't really, until I started school in September, I didn't really get to learn anything, you know, start to really learn the language. MOORE: Because you spoke Italian with whom, your father and your mother? JOCOLA: In the house, yes. MOORE: In the house. What about your cousins? You had to speak English to them, right? JOCOLA: Well, ( he laughs ) I don't remember. We did play together, so evidently we got to learning quick. MOORE: Now, back to that house, how many rooms was that house? JOCOLA: Five and a bath. MOORE: Five and a bath. And how many people lived there, then, once you got there? JOCOLA: Well, my mother, my father and myself. MOORE: And your uncle? JOCOLA: They lived across the street. MOORE: Okay. And how was it furnished? JOCOLA: Oh, everything was brand new. ( Ms. Moore laughs ) Everything was new in it. The stove, the beds, the living room couch and the chair there, everything was. MOORE: And they were store-bought? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. They were all bought. MOORE: And how was it lit, the house? JOCOLA: Electricity. MOORE: Electricity. And heated? JOCOLA: Gas. Well, we had a coal furnace, but the stove was gas. MOORE: And what about indoor plumbing? Did you have that? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, oh, yes. MOORE: Back in your home in Italy, did you have indoor plumbing? JOCOLA: No, no. MOORE: In Italy, what was it, outdoors? JOCOLA: Outdoors, that's right, outdoors. MOORE: What about the neighborhood? Describe the neighborhood you lived in in Niles when you first got there. JOCOLA: Well, it was, at that time it was a new neighborhood. All the houses were practically new. All the people were young, young couples. MOORE: And were they, what ethnic background were they? JOCOLA: Man, there must have been at least five different ones. I know there was Hungarians, there was two English families there, and Croatian. And our neighbor was Serbian, and there was two Hungarian families. MOORE: And so it wasn't an Italian neighborhood? JOCOLA: No, no. Not at all, no. MOORE: How big was the town at that time, Niles? JOCOLA: Uh, probably fifteen thousand. It's twenty-five now. MOORE: And did you get along well with your neighbors? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, yes. MOORE: Did you have any type of prejudice or slurs because you were Italian? JOCOLA: No, not, I didn't hear any. I never heard any either down there. MOORE: What about your family members' jobs? Your father at that time was working where? JOCOLA: At Republic Steel Corp. It was a big steel plant in Niles here. MOORE: And what did he do at that time? What was his job? JOCOLA: They, he worked on a big shear that cut steel. MOORE: And that was something that he had never, had he done that before he came to this country? JOCOLA: No, no, no. MOORE: So who supported your family then? Was . . . JOCOLA: My father. MOORE: Your father. And did your mother seek any employment here? JOCOLA: No, no. MOORE: So she stayed at home. JOCOLA: She stayed in the house. MOORE: Did anyone not work in your family? Your uncle, your aunt? Was there unemployment of any sort? JOCOLA: I guess there was a few years later, yeah. Well, around 1930, when the Depression set in. MOORE: And how did that influence your neighborhood at all? JOCOLA: Oh, boy, that, hardly anybody was working. I even, I remember soup kitchens down here in Niles during the Depression, you know. People, I remember people carrying kettles and going down to the soup kitchen at the end of the road. A lot of them, that's all they had to eat. MOORE: What about your own family? Did your father . . . JOCOLA: Well, he was laid off for quite a while there. But we seemed, my mother, we had a big garden. We had a big, and my mother done a lot of canning, a lot of canning. I don't remember any time that we really were in need, you know. MOORE: So you, did you use a soup kitchen yourself? JOCOLA: I went down there a couple of times, yeah. MOORE: And so the '30s, the Depression time that hit, do you remember when it hit, the Depression? JOCOLA: In 1930, '31 and '32 was the real bad part. I remember I was twelve years old then. MOORE: And did you work around the house, then? Did you help? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, around the house, the garden, things like that. MOORE: Did your family receive any support from coupons or things at that time? JOCOLA: At that time they had, what the heck did they, every family got so much a week or a month. MOORE: Rations. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: Let's go back to when you first went to school that September. How was it? What was the experience like? JOCOLA: Well, I'll tell you. It was really something looking back on it, because I didn't, I couldn't, if you didn't understand. ( he laughs ) But I had, I had a cousin in the third grade, and I had one in the fifth grade and one in the sixth grade. And, of course, my aunt, she explained it to the teacher, so actually they knew what it was. And it seemed like after a couple of months I could talk, speak the language and understand. It probably took longer than that, but that's the way it seems now, you know. MOORE: But when you, you started, what grade did you start in? JOCOLA: One, first. MOORE: In first grade. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: So other kids, you learned to read here. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, everything. MOORE: In the beginning were there any names, was there any name-calling or anything? JOCOLA: Not that I know of. I don't remember anything. MOORE: Were there other children in the same situation, not knowing English? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. Well, no. I don't believe there were, no. Not in that first room that I was in. I don't recall any. MOORE: How big was your school? JOCOLA: It's still there. It's three floors, and had, they had six grades. Now it's part of the high school. That's the way it was then. MOORE: How many children were in each class? JOCOLA: I'd say about twenty-five. There were a lot more bigger families then than there is now, you know. MOORE: What about your teachers? Do you remember any teachers? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, yeah. Our first grade teacher was Miss Campbell. At that time the teachers, the teachers couldn't, if they got married, they couldn't teach, you know. They'd lose their jobs. All the teachers were single at that time. Oh, I remember, I still remember the principal, real, Miss Moral. Because we, I had met her after I graduated from high school for, we always talked about what, she told me more about what was going on that I knew, you know. But . . . MOORE: And did they help you adjust? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. Evidently, looking back on it it seemed like a simple thing. ( he laughs ) But I know that it wasn't, but it. MOORE: How about your family? So your mother was Italian-speaking and didn't know English when she came here. Did she learn English? JOCOLA: They had to because, like I said, our neighbor was Serbian, and she couldn't, she was in the same, she couldn't speak English any more than my mother could. But then, like I say, my aunt, she knew the language well, and the people directly across the street were English. Little by little, you know, she learned enough to get by. MOORE: And so, but at home, when you came home, what did you speak? JOCOLA: We spoke Italian. MOORE: And your younger brothers, did they . . . JOCOLA: They learned to speak their language, too. They can still speak it now. MOORE: Italian. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: So Italian was the home language. JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: And everything else was in English. JOCOLA: Yeah, everything else had to be in English. MOORE: Including your cousins. JOCOLA: Oh, yes. MOORE: So Italian was confined to the home. JOCOLA: To the home, yes. MOORE: And your father, he learned English? JOCOLA: Well, yeah. See, he had been here for since, like I say, 1920. MOORE: When your family socialized, did they socialize with any other Italians besides your cousins? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, because we had a lot of relatives here. MOORE: But outside, were your friends Italian? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, oh, yes. That family on the opposite end of our street, we were on one end and they were on the other, they were Italian. MOORE: Wait a minute, this was an Italian, there's Italian towns. JOCOLA: That, but the section was on this side, up this way, and we were down that way. ( he gestures ) MOORE: So your father did not, decided not to live in the Italian section. JOCOLA: Well, he built beside his, close to his brother. MOORE: Right. JOCOLA: That was the, well, why my brother built down there, I don't know. MOORE: Now, when you came here, you'd been religious back in Italy. What did you do about your religious practice here? JOCOLA: Oh, they had the Mount Carmel Church right up the road from us. MOORE: So you maintained . . . JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, same thing. MOORE: Same thing. So did they go to Mass during the week at all? JOCOLA: No, just on Sundays. MOORE: Just Sundays. And the family went together? JOCOLA: Yes. MOORE: Who was more, who would you say was more religious, your mother or your father? JOCOLA: My mother. MOORE: And did your father attend church with you? JOCOLA: Uh, not as steady as my mother, though. MOORE: And was that the same thing in Italy? Were the women more religious than the men? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. MOORE: All right. Did you stay in that house the whole time? JOCOLA: Here? Yes. MOORE: And what did you do for entertainment in Niles, then, when you came there as a kid? JOCOLA: Well, the cousins always took us to the movies there. They had a lot of movies in Niles. That was, indoor movies, yeah. And we had picnics, and the ballfields, and the playgrounds at the schools. But whatever every child does nowadays, I guess. MOORE: Do you feel that your parents, then, did your parents adjust to life in the States? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, I would say so. MOORE: Did they speak of homesickness or missing . . . JOCOLA: No, no. MOORE: And your grandparents, how did they keep in contact with their parents, or did they? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. They kept, they all, all four of my grandparents lived to be in the eighties, and they were writing back and forth all as long as I can remember, as long as they lived. MOORE: And did your grandparents in Italy come here? JOCOLA: No, no. MOORE: And did your parents ever go back? JOCOLA: Just me and my mother went back. My father didn't want to go back. MOORE: Really? Okay. So your father, once he left for the States, didn't see his parents. JOCOLA: He didn't want to go. We went, I took her, my mother, in '59 we went back. And the fact of that experience on Ellis Island, you know, that kept her from going. She always remembered that. But we had to convince her that Ellis Island wasn't, we were citizens now, and all you were just a tourist, you know. You come back, and you go wherever you want. MOORE: Through customs. JOCOLA: We finally got, finally convinced her of that, so she went. MOORE: What did she say about that Ellis Island experience? I mean, what, why did she think it was so terrible? JOCOLA: Well, she didn't like the idea of being separated from me. That was the main thing. MOORE: So she didn't return for thirty-two years or something, thirty years. And the reason she gave was . . . JOCOLA: '27 to '59. MOORE: Oh, twenty-seven, sorry. Okay. JOCOLA: No, '27 when we came, and she went back in '59, yeah. MOORE: '59, right. So, that's thirty-two years. So the reason she gave when you asked her to go back was she didn't want to go through Ellis Island. JOCOLA: Yeah, that's what she wanted. We would have probably went right after the war, you know, but that was always on her mind. MOORE: That's good to record. JOCOLA: Sure. MOORE: ( she laughs ) So, anyway, to backtrack, I've asked you this, you didn't experience any bigotry or any racism for being your nationality. JOCOLA: No, nothing. MOORE: Okay. Did any family member, including your cousins, anyone in your extended family, did they return to Italy and pack it up and go back? JOCOLA: No. My father's brother had the same notion. He didn't want to go back. He had plenty of opportunity but he didn't want to go. MOORE: And how did you feel particularly Italian? You came here, you adjusted here, you learned English, you went through the school system. Did you ever feel as if you were Italian as opposed, I mean, did you feel that besides being American that you had an Italian identity? JOCOLA: Well, yeah, sure, I had that, but people, the kids I grew up with, and after we got to work, to working and all that, we were all different nationalities, so it really didn't matter, you know. Nobody paid much attention to it. MOORE: Did any family tragedy occur in the time that was significant in the time after you came to the United States? JOCOLA: The family here or over there? MOORE: The family here. JOCOLA: Here? Well, we had a little sister, and she died in, she was about twelve months old when she did. MOORE: And when was she born? JOCOLA: She was the youngest one. She was born, she had to be around 1933. I remember she died of pneumonia. MOORE: And do you feel that your parents, did your parents ever talk about the fact that they thought it was good, that they wanted to come to the States and that it was a good decision? JOCOLA: Oh, yes, because over there right after the war there was nothing. MOORE: So did they express this? Did they have any regrets? JOCOLA: No, no. They, all in all they made a good life here. MOORE: And what about you? How did, you went on, and what occupation did you have? JOCOLA: I became a welder. MOORE: A welder. JOCOLA: And that's, I done that most, till I retired. MOORE: So what was the course of your life? You went through high school in Niles. JOCOLA: Yeah, I graduated from high school. MOORE: And then what did you do? JOCOLA: I took a, I don't, I guess you'd have to call it a, some kind of a school, a welding school there for three months, then I got a job from then on. MOORE: And where were you a welder? JOCOLA: I had two different places. What they call the Youngstown Steel Car Corporation here in Niles, and the Grenell Corporation in Warren. That's part of ITT. That's where I'm retired from. MOORE: And what about your brothers? What did they do? JOCOLA: Well, one brother was a, before he retired he was a machinist at Republic Steel, and the other one was a baker. MOORE: Good for family gatherings. JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. MOORE: To be a baker. What about marriage or your family? Did you have children? Did you . . . JOCOLA: We have two children. The wife and I got married, we, well, it was pretty late, not too late, but late. She was thirty-seven, and I was thirty-nine. And we have a son and a daughter. MOORE: How did you meet your wife? JOCOLA: Uh, she, just before the war started, they needed welders bad, you know. And there wasn't any train - they started to train women, women, you know. And she, she graduated in '41, she got a, she got a job where I was working. That's how we met. MOORE: And were there many other women? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah. MOORE: She was a welder? JOCOLA: Yeah. MOORE: With you, on the job? JOCOLA: Not with, well, yeah, sometimes. MOORE: So you fell in love at work. JOCOLA: Well, I guess you'd have to call that. ( they laugh ) But we didn't, after, you know, after the war was over and that, they let the women go. But, of course, that's, she got a job other places. MOORE: Wait a minute. Why did they let the women go after the war? JOCOLA: As welders, I mean. MOORE: Why did they do that? JOCOLA: Well, I guess they had the men come back from the service that were welders, see. MOORE: I see. So the women were substitutes. JOCOLA: They were actually substitutes. But she didn't, we went our separate ways. And, well, it was almost twelve, fourteen years. ( he laughs ) I don't know, we got acquainted all over again, and we got married. MOORE: Was she a welder then, afterwards? JOCOLA: No, no. She was working in the steel mill up here, but she wasn't welding. They were, they were little sheets of metal that they made tin cans out of. She would inspect them to see that there was no holes in them, and there was about, oh, twenty girls doing the same thing there. MOORE: But this welding time, how long was she a welder, actually? JOCOLA: Oh, I'd say maybe two years. MOORE: Wow, the women. So fourteen years goes by, and then how, I'm not being nosy, I'm trying to get this down. Fourteen, ten, twelve, fourteen years goes by, and how did you meet her again? Did you just call her on the phone? JOCOLA: Well, we'd run into each other. She just lived, oh, five miles down the road here at a place called Lenore Ridge, Ohio. MOORE: So, and then you have two children, a boy and a girl? JOCOLA: A boy and a girl. The boy was just transferred from Indiana back here. He had gone to school here and all that, and the girl, she'd been here all the time. MOORE: Were you, what's your boys' name? JOCOLA: Michael. MOORE: Michael. JOCOLA: And the girl was Jan. MOORE: All right. And how old are they now? JOCOLA: Well, the boy is thirty, thirty-three, and she's thirty-two. MOORE: And what do they do? JOCOLA: Uh, she's, she works at the headquarters of the company that my boy works for. In fact, she's the business manager of the office. She runs the office up here. And she married a fellow that owns what they call a ski chalet, you know, the skiing and scuba diving. They're all over the country. Florida, Vermont, out west, Lake Tahoe, all over the place. And then the boy is, he's a, sort of like a troubleshooter for this company. He was working in Indiana, and they moved him over here now. ( a telephone rings ) MOORE: Hold on. ( break in tape ) You said your son, what is the name of the company your son works for? JOCOLA: Uh, they call it The Alphabet Corporation. MOORE: Its business is? JOCOLA: Well, he goes from plant to plant checking on the, what they're making, you know, things like that. That's all I know. ( he laughs ) MOORE: Did you speak Italian to your children? Did you speak Italian to them? JOCOLA: No. See, my wife's not Italian. MOORE: What ethnic background is your wife? JOCOLA: Uh, she's German. MOORE: She's German. JOCOLA: German. MOORE: So, did the grandparents, were your parents alive when they . . . JOCOLA: Oh, yes. My mother lived, she just died about three years ago. She was ninety-one. My father died when he was sixty-eight. In fact, my father died about ten days after my son was born. MOORE: At least he knew that your son was born. JOCOLA: Yeah. He knew he had a grandson. MOORE: And so your children, how in any way did they pass on anything Italian? Were they interested in their background? JOCOLA: Oh, yes. The boy, especially. He always wears a, I guess, sweatshirt with the word "Italy" across it all the time. MOORE: Were they ever interested in learning Italian? JOCOLA: No, I don't believe so, because it's not a major language nowadays, for around here anyhow. MOORE: If you look back on your life now, you came when you were very small here. Did you ever want to go, would you ever consider going back to Italy to live? JOCOLA: To live there? No, not to live there. Well, now I could, yeah, but, I mean, as far as going back when I was young, no. MOORE: And so do you have in reflection, what is your attitude towards your parents immigrating to this country? JOCOLA: Oh, I'm very happy they did. MOORE: And do you think that your parents, in the course of their lives, felt the same? JOCOLA: Oh, yeah, sure, oh, yes. MOORE: Well, that's a good place to end this interview. I'd like to thank you very much for taking the time for Ellis Island, on Ellis Island's behalf and on my behalf, and we're going to send you a copy of the interview as well. JOCOLA: Oh, good. MOORE: And, anyway, this is Kate Moore in Warren, Ohio on the 4th of January, 1994.
