She came to work where I was working, at a laundry. MRS. CAPP: That's right, at Thornton's. MOORE: And where was that? CAPP: Thornton's Laundry. MRS. CAPP: Thornton's Laundry. MOORE: Thornton's Laundry. And you guys were working together, then? CAPP: She was in the front, I was in the washroom. MRS.

CAPP: Do you know what they are? MOORE: I had one. CAPP: You had one. What did you do? MOORE: Just fixed them with inserts in the shoes. CAPP: No. I went to the doctor for two months. He soaked my feet, and then he had a big, bigger than my toaster, an electrical machine and he had another thing I think he was scraping my heel. MOORE: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, that's one possibility. You, uh . . . CAPP: And since then my corn don't bother me. After that, nothing in my shoe. My (?) in my shoe. MOORE: But you guys, okay. You guys got married how long after you met?

CAPP: Hey, are you married? MOORE: No. CAPP: No? How often do you see your parents? MOORE: How old are my parents? CAPP: I said how often do you see them? MOORE: I try to see them as much as I can, but it's not that much. CAPP: What do you mean "not that much." MOORE: Well, I see them like once every two months, maybe. CAPP: Do they live in the same town? MOORE: No, they don't. They live out in New York. CAPP: Oh, that's a different story. That's a different story. But here the kids are under your nose and they don't know you unless they want something. ( Ms. Moore laughs ) Why are you laughing? MOORE: If they live close, they take you for granted, maybe.

CAPP: '57, and his mother was what? '69? CAPP: '69. MRS. CAPP: 1969. END OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE ONE, TAPE TWO MOORE: If you look back on your life . . . CAPP: I wish I knew then what I knew now. MOORE: You wish you knew what you knew now, but are you happy, I mean, how do you feel about coming to the States? How do you feel now? Was it a good decision, do you think? CAPP: Yeah. What the hell would I do in a Communistic country? Hey, hey . . . MRS. CAPP: (?) He'd like to go back, I think, just to see the place. CAPP: Hey, here's the point. I don't walk straight. I walk like I'm drunk. On the farm you got to do work from daylight to night time. I couldn't do that. MOORE: So you think it was a good decision. CAPP: That's right. MOORE: Did she feel the same way, your mother and your father? Did they feel the same way? Was it an okay decision, or did they want to go back? CAPP: My mother wanted to go back the first year. After that, she was on her own. See what happened today (?). We (?). MOORE: Hold on for a second. CAPP: (?) CAPP: Honey, one minute . . . MOORE: One second. CAPP: Let her go. (?) I got (?). MOORE: No, I got it. That's all right. CAPP: I got (?). ( break in tape ) MOORE: Okay. So you said that your mother and father, your mother wanted to come back after one year. CAPP: After, about, that was if it was (?) my little sister. I bring her to her senses, (?) used to be. And Mama wanted to be, Mama wanted Dad to work somewhere, so we moved down, down this way, and he got a job in the concrete company, concrete sales. He got a job working where my uncle worked. Boy, I don't know, my mother had a sister over here, too. And church on Thursday evening for seven o'clock Mass. And we had a storm. See that crack over there? Behind it there was a chimney, and there was a piece of tin. Coming down the stovepipe, because, at that time. My uncle was sleeping like near the cabinet, the storm came in and hit the chimney, and he got up, thrown on (?). MOORE: Now, who came in, you said? Who came in? CAPP: No, my mother and her sister-in-law went to church on Thursday evening, on Good Thursday, and in the church for Good Thursday. Easter time, Good Thursday. All night they washed, everything ready for Easter, and the storm came around. He hid down in the chimney, like I said, and my uncle was right under it, all the soot came out over his face, over his face. MOORE: Well, we're going to go back to the story about your parents. Did you think your, so what did you say about your parents? Did they ever talk about coming to America, whether they found it a good decision or not? Did they ever talk about that? CAPP: No. MOORE: Why not? CAPP: Because they were used to it, when you get used to something, you've had a job at night, didn't you? MOORE: Yeah. CAPP: And didn't you like it? MOORE: Yeah. CAPP: Oh, my it's the same damn thing with foreign people. MOORE: Well, so, do you know anybody in your family that ever went back to Poland, at the beginning? CAPP: No, no. Well, I had, my uncle that, my father's brother was here in America about, around 1910 or something like that. And he went back to his wife. I don't now how long he stayed and he went back, and he's never been back. MOORE: So that's the one person you know who didn't go back. CAPP: Yeah, that's all. MOORE: Well, we'd like to thank you very much for the Ellis Island Oral History Project for helping us. CAPP: You can take that home. MOORE: We'll take those and we'll put this in the record. We have a record there. We're going to take a picture of you. All your papers will be there. These medical records I can ask about. I don't know much about that system, but I can ask you. But we will also send you a tape at the end. CAPP: (?) MOORE: A copy of this. It will take through the summer.
