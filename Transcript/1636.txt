If you'd, the other one woman, next to the one (?), she was very hard up for everything. She'd come and beg for something. She'd come to beg for something, she'd bring some false stories against any of us. RODNEY: The children, any of you children. ST. BERNARD: Yeah, yeah.

A couple next door to me, the MacMillans, they belonged to the Methodist Church, and they go to St. George's also. They go to St. George's Church. Where I lived at, we used to go to St. David's, so my sister said, "I'll go to St. George's." And my sister go to St. George's, and my sister go to St. George's, and the rest of us go to St. David's church. RODNEY: Did you like going to church? ST. BERNARD: Huh? RODNEY: Did you like going to church? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, I did. RODNEY: Do you remember the holidays in the country of Grenada? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. RODNEY: What were they like? ST. BERNARD: It was very pleasant to every one of us because we would say education was good for every boy and girl. If you seek it, you'll find no fault, and the result will be welcome, so we were welcome the teacher. Teachers needed less (?), so we would welcome vacation. RODNEY: Do you remember the names of any holidays? ST. BERNARD: Yes. The 24th of May was Victoria Holiday, and Christmas Holiday, New Year's. RODNEY: And what kind of things did you do to celebrate?

RODNEY: Did you cook special foods? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, we do cook special foods. RODNEY: Can you tell me about them? ST. BERNARD: Well, in Christmas time in the nearest time, like in August, independence day. We used different things that we doesn't use, different meats like we never use every day, you know. We used them in the holidays, like beef and lamb and chicken and fish. Those were the things we used on those occasions. RODNEY: Now, do you remember what school was like? ST. BERNARD: Yes. School was very pleasant to me. I remember I would, one of my teachers that I couldn't remember her name was Clarista Forrester. She was very educated person, and she was a really good teacher, and she, she took a liking to me because I was, pay attention to my lessons and pass my marks very well. And when I reached to eighth standard, my schoolmaster's daughter was in the same class with me, and she was making good marks. So he took me from eighth standard and put me through the second standard where there were rough children didn't care about, and they knocked my arms off when they were lighting everything. And then I stopped the hand, they told (?) to come and beat me for that because his school, his daughter was in love with me. And, uh, I was trying to avoid her because he paying attention to that, so he be crying she wasn't making marks, so he beat me unnecessary for that. And then I got an examination, I got a present from the Board of Education, I got, I got good marks, I got a pennant from the Board of Education, books and stationeries and opens and pencils and some other articles. And the schoolmaster, they, they go to education, direct that they should have a holiday, one day of the week, two days. Very pleasant to me. And the schoolmaster kept it, you wouldn't believe it, kept it, never leave it. And then the war broke out, and then I went and enlisted, and then he had an elegnation who had the highest marks for fifth, sixth, fifth standard, sixth standard, seventh standard and eighth standard, who have the highest marks in two months will get the present. I won. He wouldn't believe it to me. So I, until I enlisted in the army and he had this elimination and won, and my cousin won all the presents from me. And I never, I never see it at all until I came back from the war, and they showed me all the presents that he won with all my name printed on it. I never got it, so he hand it to me, because his daughter wasn't making none of the marks close to mine, you know. So that's, he held it on. And my cousin got that present. So I went to the war, and there he totally assess my (?) from Grenada to Alexandria, Egypt. And there was, there was the camp for all the arrangements, you know. Alexandria, Egypt . . . RODNEY: All the regiments. ST. BERNARD: Regiments, yeah. So I was belonged to the second battalion, big company, and we were assigned to the eighth brigade, Australian and (?) brigade, and that's where we functioned from there. And they, they choose so many from each company to go to the firing line sometimes when I went to the firing line. And I, so there, and the back of the (?) I got wounded, and I went, I took the camel back and cross the George River on the Camel's back, went down, took care of Egypt Hospital. And it was yesterday getting better, and I was told she gonna send me. I come to the convalescent camp, and she told me that half an hour they (?). And she come back and tell me bad news, that the French line had lost so many, had so much causalities that the commander-in-chief ordered that any soul that could stand on the street was to go back to his camp, get equipped and go back to the firing line. So I went back. And then before later on, I was assigned to the no-man's land to get locations of the enemy. RODNEY: Mr. St. Bernard, when were you discharged from the, from the, uh, you were in the army? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. RODNEY: When were you discharged? ST. BERNARD: Huh? RODNEY: When were you discharged? ST. BERNARD: I was discharged in Ishmania, Egypt, after we came from the firing line back to Egypt from (?) back to Egypt. That's where, that's where I got my discharge. RODNEY: So when did you decide to come to America? ST. BERNARD: Oh, decided, in the 19, uh, late in 1923. RODNEY: Did you already know someone here? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, I knew someone, but I don't decide to come right away. I went to, to Cuba. I went to Cuba and spent about three-and-a-half years, about four years in Cuba. And from Cuba I decided to come to America. RODNEY: Did you tell anyone that you, did you tell members of your family that you were coming to America? ST. BERNARD: No, no. No, because my mother had died and my sister had treated me rough, you know, so I didn't tell them. I came to America then, and, uh, from there I travelled in different locations. RODNEY: I wanted to ask you, did you take anything special with you when you came to America? Is there anything that had great value that you took? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, my discharge, honorable discharge papers from the, signed by the King George V. It's read. We . . . RODNEY: Go ahead. ST. BERNARD: By St. George. RODNEY: You . . . Go ahead, I'm sorry. ST. BERNARD: King and emperor of England. I can read it to you. RODNEY: That's fine. Did you, do you remember what port you left from to come to America? Where did you, what, where did you leave from? ST. BERNARD: Oh, from, um, the port in, um, come to, uh, Flanders, Erliante Province. RODNEY: What country was this in? ST. BERNARD: I was in Cuba. RODNEY: Cuba. ST. BERNARD: Yeah. From Cuba I came right to, uh, New York. And, uh . . . RODNEY: How was the, how was the journey on the boat? ST. BERNARD: It was very pleasant. And when I went to the port, I had, I had quite an amount of money there because I worked through Cuba, I worked with contractors and then I became a contractor myself. So I accumulated money at that time. The Cuba wasn't collecting taxes from the money you make at all. Just make it and save it. You can save all, you can raise all you want. Everything you make you can save as much as you can. So that's what I did. I saved as much as I can. And when I reached the harbor in, in New York, the, you had to show how much you have, if you have enough money, if you have fifty dollars or something like that. But I had about, I had about two thousand dollars on me, so the harbor master shake my hand, he said, "Welcome to our port, and hope you like it and become a citizen." I say, "I will." And . . . RODNEY: Before we talk more about that, I also wanted to talk, ask you about the actual journey over on the ship. What kind of ship did you come on? ST. BERNARD: The S.S. Munago. RODNEY: Was it a big ship? ST. BERNARD: A great big ship, yeah. RODNEY: Do you remember what class you traveled in? ST. BERNARD: I (?) first class. It was, the passenger and cargo ship was a great ship. It took a lot of sugar from Cuba to America. RODNEY: How long did the trip take? ST. BERNARD: I can't really remember. It was a very short voyage. RODNEY: It was less than a day. ST. BERNARD: No, it was more than a day. RODNEY: About two days? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, about two days, yeah. RODNEY: Do you remember where you slept when you were on the ship? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. I was in the first class for (?) cabins. RODNEY: So you had a cabin to yourself, or you . . . ST. BERNARD: Yeah, to myself, yeah. RODNEY: Did you know anyone on the ship? ST. BERNARD: I knew just people that I knew in Cuba that, none of my relatives. RODNEY: Were they friends of yours? ST. BERNARD: There were no friends, but just were traveling with me, that's all. RODNEY: Was there anything to do on the ship? ST. BERNARD: No. I just viewed the, viewed the (?) as we travelled I saw. RODNEY: Do you remember what you ate on the ship? ST. BERNARD: No, I couldn't remember that. The meal was very good, that's all. RODNEY: Do you remember seeing land for the first time? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. The land, the first time I see was America, because the other places I saw was no, after I leave Cuba to America, we just see no other country until you reach America. RODNEY: Do you remember what it was like when you saw land in America? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. First I saw the Statue of Liberty, and it was very interesting to me. Yeah. RODNEY: So you'd never seen anything like that before? ST. BERNARD: No. RODNEY: What were your impressions of New York City the first time you saw it? ST. BERNARD: The Statue of Liberty. That impressed me the most. Then I saw the other tall buildings in New York then, in Brooklyn, saw the other tall buildings along New York and then in Brooklyn. I could view the buildings in Brooklyn. RODNEY: When you got from the ship onto Ellis Island, what did you notice? Did you see the buildings? ST. BERNARD: Yes, the buildings, and all these buildings and, uh, I never, and there. After the directions, you know, I wanted to go, to go, nobody came to meet me. But when I reached, when I landed I took the boat from, um, Ellis Island to go to Brooklyn. RODNEY: You didn't have to have any medical examinations? ST. BERNARD: No. You had to go through medical education, examinations from Cuba or you weren't allowed to travel. RODNEY: And who gave you that examination? ST. BERNARD: Huh? The doctor gave you that examination. RODNEY: At the port? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. Yeah, before they signed the passport, yeah. RODNEY: Can you describe any of the things or people you saw on Ellis Island? ON Ellis Island? ST. BERNARD: No, I couldn't tell you. After that I visited Ellis Island several times. And when my friends come I bring them to Ellis Island and we go right to the top, right up to the hand. I think that impressed me very much. RODNEY: I think that's the Statue of Liberty, Mr. Bernard. ST. BERNARD: Huh? RODNEY: I think that's the Statue of Liberty. ST. BERNARD: Yeah. I went up through, right through her arm, uh, to her hand. The head was broken, they had to repair it. Took quite a while before they repaired the head. You remember? But that was a new, the new Statue of Liberty that was built over, you remember? RODNEY: Right. ST. BERNARD: Yeah. RODNEY: Well, Mr. St. Bernard, what did you do after you left Ellis Island? ST. BERNARD: I went to 727 Washington Avenue. And then I settled there four weeks, you know, and then afterwards got a job, just a temporary job. RODNEY: But how did you get there? Did you take a taxi or the subway or . . . ST. BERNARD: No, the trolley. It was at the trolley then. RODNEY: Did you know someone who lived there? Did someone put you up? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. Well, I had a brother-in-law. I was staying at my brother-in-law's place for a while, and then afterwards i moved downtown to Willoughby Street. RODNEY: Were you living by yourself at that time? ST. BERNARD: All the time, yeah. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO RODNEY: Did you ever have to deal with any bigotry or persecution or prejudice since you've been here? ST. BERNARD: In the building? RODNEY: Well, since you've been in America? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. RODNEY: Could you talk about that? ST. BERNARD: Persecution? RODNEY: Or prejudice, or . . . ST. BERNARD: No, no. I couldn't see that. I wouldn't call it persecution. And a job that some guys wanted, in a job that all of us were doing, and afterwards the foreman give me a lighter job, and the chemical office, it's a dispatch from the chemical office to the boiler room, so that they're jealous of me, and I an (?) young fellow took a bag of acid, soaked a bag of acid and throw it on my head through lunch hour. They had to take me from there to the Brooklyn Hospital the same night. And he just ran away. He never had to come back. RODNEY: Were you all right? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. Well, afterwards, they saved my eyes, but years afterwards it, I had to, I developed cataracts. I had cataracts, examined, I had surgery on both eyes so I can see ordinary now. Not quite well. My reading had been very close right now. Well, I can still read. RODNEY: And that happened because that man did that to you? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. Well, afterwards they say it blew apart in my head. I remember a lot of it blew in my head. RODNEY: When was that? ST. BERNARD: Some sugar fell on my head in the sugar refinery, you know. RODNEY: When did you work at the sugar refinery? ST. BERNARD: That's, when did I work? It was after late, while I was living in, um, 424 Willoughby Street, Ashland Place. RODNEY: In Brooklyn? ST. BERNARD: Brooklyn, yeah.

Did you get along with them? ST. BERNARD: In Brooklyn? RODNEY: Yes. ST. BERNARD: Well, in Brooklyn when you're, you're living in a house like that, somebody next door to you doesn't even know them. They go from their house to the work and come back. If you meet them in the streets, perhaps you know that they live next door to you. That's the only reason that you know them. They live next door, that's all. RODNEY: So you've never been very close with your neighbors? ST. BERNARD: Close to my neighbors, I talk to them like that, but never let them come in and out of my house, apartment, no. RODNEY: When you, since you'd been in America, have you gone to church regularly? ST. BERNARD: Yes, I do. Up to now is, since I can't travel by myself, and I have a lady living right in (?) Street, Ms. Helen Gaskin, pick me up and take me to church. RODNEY: Could you spell Helen's name? ST. BERNARD: H-E-L-E-N, G-A-S-K-I-N. RODNEY: So how far is the church from where you live? ST. BERNARD: Oh, it's quite a while, quite a while from 728 to 765, put them (?). RODNEY: And how do you get there? ST. BERNARD: This lady take me, take me in the lobby and take me there. RODNEY: What's the name of your church? ST. BERNARD: St. Leonard's, L-E-O-N-A-R-D-S. RODNEY: St. Leonard's Church. ST. BERNARD: Yeah, St. Leonard's Church. RODNEY: Do you enjoy going to church? ST. BERNARD: Huh? RODNEY: Do you enjoy going to church? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, I do, because I pay attention to the lectures, pay attention to the lectures whether they're interesting or not, I listen to them attentively. RODNEY: Do you, did any of your, other members of your family also come to America? ST. BERNARD: Yes. I have a niece live at 923 Lincoln Place, and I, my daughter live at 1099 Barbie Street. They had the reception for me on my 100th birthday. That's where I had the reception on my 100th birthday. And . . . RODNEY: Did any of your brothers or sisters come over to America? ST. BERNARD: No, I'm the oldest one in the family. Both my father and my mother's side, I'm the oldest alive. All other died. RODNEY: So can you briefly describe for me your life since coming to America? Marriage, children, occupation, anything about meeting a spouse? ST. BERNARD: Oh, well, not pleasant, far from being pleasant. I went to a party and a fellow introduced me to a girl (?) and she was a maiden, and she had nobody and everything, and I had dates with her, and she move in in my apartment, and that's (?) living hell. She had lied to me. She was married, left her husband down south. And I was working hard, and I worked, all through the Korean war I was assistant machinist and I was working eighteen hours and giving her money to bank, and she was said not to bank the money, not to bank the money, all going out, and she wouldn't bank the money. "I'm saving it, I'm saving it." Every day was Christmas in my apartment. The house was full with people. She feeding all the friends and relatives. She had a mother and a sister, and niece down south. She had a niece. She had a sister in Jersey, another one in Flushing. And she, every time they need money they come to her. She just giving my money right on. And I couldn't get (?) come and (?). She tell me I give him two hundred dollars, and all the money she, I said, "How much money you think?" "I saving the money. You don't trust me." She was working low (?), and couldn't demand it to show my money, until afterwards I said I was going to follow. So I decide, then I got hit by a car. I went to Jewish Hospital, and she thought she'd get rid of me then. She got a crooked lawyer to put, put her name on my deed, and all on my insurance, liability insurance, fire insurance, furniture insurance, all this, I had all this. She got the (?) and everything, and put it in her name. So I got better, when I came out, and see what's going on. The minute I came in, went through the door, I came back and I was working in the factory, at Rand Rubber Company, which I worked there for thirteen-and-a-half years. That's where I retired. RODNEY: What's the name of the company, sir? ST. BERNARD: Rand, Rand Rubber Company. RODNEY: Could you spell that? ST. BERNARD: R-A-N-D, R-U-B-B-E-R, Rand Rubber Company. So when I saw that she, my name wasn't on it, she put her name, she got a crooked lawyer to, and the insurance company saw it, knew it was crooked, why my name wasn't mentioned at all, change of name, know of any sale. So they, the insurance about five times what it was, what I was paying. And she didn't pay it, believing I gonna play it. When the notice came that I, the insurance had lapsed, I paid so much and so much. When I looked at the amount they charged for six months, it was more than I was paying for three years. So I said, "That's that." I let the house, and I let it foreclose the house. Then her brother came and tell her he take her up to Connecticut, I will follow. That was the best thing happen to me. RODNEY: Did you ever have any sons or daughters, Mr. St. Bernard? ST. BERNARD: No, no. One I met, one girl said I was, had a child from me, but that I left home then and I didn't know nothing about it. RODNEY: Well, in conclusion, are you happy that you came to America? ST. BERNARD: Yeah. I went through rough, thin and thick, I made out. Never had to go to the red line or go in, or getting the relief or nothing. When, when they called it hard time coming, Hoover and everything, I got a friend of mine, we took, with credit cards, came to interior decorators, and we went around painting, all around we're painting all from Brooklyn, New York, Bronx, until he died. When he died then I took the job at the Rand Rubber Company and I worked there until I retired. That's the last place I worked. RODNEY: Are there any closing comments you'd like to make? ST. BERNARD: Huh? RODNEY: Are there any closing comments, anything you'd like to say before ending the interview? ST. BERNARD: Well, a fellow, before I left Rand Rubber Company, the salesman, the head of the, the head of the, um, factory, they change and we got a bigger job and got a new, what do you call, is it, master of the workers. RODNEY: Supervisor? ST. BERNARD: Yeah, supervisor. So he start up, wanted to cut off so much thing as was, trying to do, on the city now. Give me so much extra job, extra job, extra job, extra job. I had to take care of one hundred and twenty-five machines, put it, service them, you know. I was assistant to the head machinist. Then he make me had to go assist in the printing press, cutting cards and everything. And then, in the cutting room they used to have the cutters deliver the goods in the sewing department. He cut that out, make me, had to go it, and they do that now also. Then afterwards as a machinist finish work, I had to go and check, and check how much work and give them the, see how much work they do and deliver the work in the next floor. So I said, "How much work are you going to give me? There's no laws of limitation?" He says, "No, no, no, nothing like laws of limitation. If you don't like what I'm doing, you can report to the, to the insurance manager. And what they have to tell me I can tell you to stick it up his hind part." Where the office have, anything you say is, I can tell you here. I say, "Yeah." I say, "Well, the hell with you." So he fired me then. He say, "You're fired." So I went to the arbitration board. I went to the arbitration board and I told him exactly what happened. He told me I was overworked and underpaid, so they demand him to raise my salary and cut off so much of the other work. So then they paid the fellow working in the shipping room from Baltimore, they came here. Yeah. They set up the thing and then a lot of, a lot of (?) to the ceiling, because the factory, the ceiling is high, you know.
