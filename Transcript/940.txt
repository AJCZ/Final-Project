SIGRIST: Good afternoon. This is Paul Sigrist for the National Park Service. Today is Thursday, April 6th, 1995. I’m in the Ellis Island recording studio, however I’m using the digital machine, the portable machine. And I’m here with William Arnold LaBell. And LaBell is spelled capital L-A, capital B-E-L-L. Mr. LaBell came from Sweden in 1920, and he was six years old at that time. Mr. LaBell, thank you for coming up here. LaBell: Well, it’s a pleasure. SIGRIST: Can you begin by you giving me your birthdate, please? LaBell: May 18th, 1914. SIGRIST: And where in Sweden were you born? LaBell: In (unintelligible), in, in parts called Overby. O-V- E-R-B-Y, Sweden. SIGRIST: Where in Sweden is that? LaBell: Well, that’s up. Well, it’s near Stromstad. S-T-R-O- M-S-T-A-D. Because my mother worked there as a nurse. SIGRIST: Good. And I appreciate you spelling everything for us. All right. You said your mother worked as a nurse in this town. Tell me a little bit about your mother’s background. What was her name first of all? LaBell: Her, her maiden name was Nelsen. SIGRIST: Can you spell that, please? LaBell: N-E-L-S-O-N. SIGRIST: And her first name? LaBell: Matilda. M-A-T-I-L-D-A. Olena. O-L-E-N-A. SIGRIST: Tell me a little bit about what you know of her background. LaBell: Well, she came from a family that had about four daughters and three or four sons. And they all were very productive. She herself had three boys and two girls. One girl unfortunately died before we left Sweden. So we only had one. And we had one daughter born here in the United States. SIGRIST: Do you know how your mother got involved in the, in the, you said she worked in a hospital. Did she have training... LaBell: Not in the sense that you people here have nurses in the hospital. Over there they had what they call a, people would go into have a treatment for their aches and pains, like arthritis or rheumatism or something. And her job was to take them into this bathroom. And they covered them with seaweed, and then get a temperature going on. And after they, after they had this treatment, they then came and dried themselves. Then she had to rub, rub them down with an, an oil to more or less give a little, and that was a thing that she did for years. And she enjoyed doing it. And it was... SIGRIST: That’s very interesting. LaBell: Yeah. Ladies, men. Now whether they had other (unintelligible), I don’t know. That’s seventy-five years ago. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Do you remember any other kinds of treatments that your mother may have administered in... LaBell: No. She was not in the professional nursing. She, she always called herself as a nurse in that particular treatment center. So that’s where I came out. SIGRIST: Can you describe your mother in words for me? What did she look like? LaBell: Well, she looked like an angel. She was really a very good, dear and sweet mother. She cared for her children very much, and she protected us and watched over us at all times. SIGRIST: How tall was she? LaBell: I’d say she was about five foot nine, five foot ten. SIGRIST: What color hair? LaBell: She had dark hair but it turned grey when she came here to the United States. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Before you came to the United States, when you were still in Sweden, is there a situation or a story that you remember specifically about your mother in Sweden? Something that happened or a story that you like to tell about something she did? LaBell: Well, I know that when word got around town that we were going to go to America, the people, my aunt and uncle, got together and they decided to have a party. And it was decided before we left that they all came over to our place, and they were carrying all kinds of delicacies. And we had a wonderful evening. And I was about five, going on six then. And I was so happy to see so many people. And Mother said, ‘See how many friends we have?’ (he laughs) And they really gave us a good send off. And there’s many times over there in Sweden that I remember that during the holidays, Christmas came around, we would have our what they call a community bake shop. And the ladies in the neighborhood would get together, and they’d make an arrangement, they would go over in teams to the particular bake shop. And they’d do their baking over there rather than do it at home, because they had all the facilities there. And my mother used to take me along. My other brothers were back at the house with my aunt. And I got a big kick out of that. That was like a community project. And they worked very nicely together. And I sat in the corner and just played with another kid, and we had a good time. (he laughs) We had a good time. SIGRIST: What kinds of things would have been baked in a situation like this? LaBell: Crackers. Cookies. Anything that pertains to Christmas. It would be like cinnamon crack, tarts. And they made sort of a bread, and it was, everything that they imagine that you want. SIGRIST: What, what else do you remember about food in Sweden? What kinds of food did you eat that stick out in your mind? LaBell: Well, we had, we ate a lot of fish. SIGRIST: What kinds of fish? LaBell: Well, no, I wouldn’t know. But we had fish, we had sill, potatoes... SIGRIST: Sill? LaBell: And potatoes. SIGRIST: What is sill? LaBell: Sill is like sardines. Big sardines. SIGRIST: S-I-L-L? LaBell: L, right. And potatoes. And then we had shot, meatballs, shotballe [PH] we call it. And we had knackebrod. That’s like... SIGRIST: Can you spell these? (he laughs) LaBell: Well, knackebrod is almost like, what would you call it over here? It’s brown, like this here (he indicates), and it’s all hard. It was more like the size of a pizza pie, and it’s all got little holes that was hard, and you put butter on it and eat it, and it’s very good for you. So it was... SIGRIST: Like a heavy cracker kind of texture? LaBell: Yeah. Right. Yeah. So... SIGRIST: What was your favorite food as a child in Sweden? LaBell: Anything that came before me. (they laugh) SIGRIST: Who did the cooking in your household? LaBell: Well, my mother did most of the cooking. SIGRIST: What was the best thing she made? LaBell: Well, the best thing she made I would say would be her rice pudding. SIGRIST: How did she make her rice pudding? LaBell: Well, I couldn’t tell you, but it was delicious. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Was that something for special occasions, or... LaBell: No, we, she gave it to us quite regularly. And I think another thing she used to make is what we call ‘grat.’ G-R-A-T, grat. And that was what was used as oatmeal would be over here. And that was delicious. And that was our, our morning food. So then we had pancakes. And we used to have eggs. SIGRIST: Did you have your own livestock? LaBell: No. She had to buy... SIGRIST: You bought it? LaBell: Yeah, bought it. She got it from my uncle, because my uncle had a farm abut a mile away from where we stayed. So it was very nice. SIGRIST: Were you living in town? LaBell: No, we lived out, out of town. The town there wasn’t too big. I’d say maybe if you had thirty or forty families you had a big, big, big... SIGRIST: Do you remember the layout of the town? What... LaBell: Well, no. In a way I could tell you that we were up on like a little knoll. And then we walked down, and down sort of a winding road, and it would take us down to the what we call, the, to the main highway like. And that road we would take then to walk over to my uncle’s farm. It’d be about a mile. And... SIGRIST: Now, is this uncle, is this your, your mother’s brother? LaBell: My mother’s, my mother’s sister’s husband. SIGRIST: I see. LaBell: And he would, he would, he had a large family. He had fourteen children. Two died. But... SIGRIST: What was his name, do you remember? LaBell: Gee, I forgot his name now. It was seventy-five years ago. (he laughs) But it was, he, he was a real nice, nice, nice, Anders. A-N-D-E-R-S, Anders. SIGRIST: And his last name would be your mother's... LaBell: Well... SIGRIST: Oh, no. He, he’s something else. LaBell: Well, he, his name now was, you see, over there you took the last name of the father. If, Uncle Gustaf, (unintelligible) Gustafson. And he would take the word, son of, he would be son of Gustafson. So he would, they took the last name Gustaf. SIGRIST: Oh, interesting. LaBell: Gustafson, yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember visiting the farm? LaBell: Oh, yes. SIGRIST: What sticks out in your mind about visiting your uncle and aunt’s farm? LaBell: Well, I tell you, my grandfather was over there. That was his fa, my mother’s father. And we used to go over there, I used to go over there and play with him and talk to him. And I would always sit on his lap. And he’d be so nice. And then he’d say, ‘Now you want to go out and see the, the livestock and the barn?’ So we go look at the livestock. And then we went to the pig pen, and we’d go over and see the horses and the cows. And he took me all around, and he, he treated me just like his own son. And he was so happy to be, and I was so happy to be with him. (he laughs) SIGRIST: So your grandfather was sort of your buddy when you were over there? LaBell: Right, right. We grew up together. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Tell me a little bit about your grandfather, and what you know about his history. LaBell: Well, I don’t know too much about his history, but I know that he was just wond, wonderful man. And he did a great deal. Like, of course, my, unfortunately my father’s father died at a very young age. My father was about sixteen or seventeen when his father died. So that was before he was married. SIGRIST: Why don’t we talk about your father. What was his name? LaBell: His name, name was John, John Adolf. SIGRIST: And tell me what you do know about your father’s background and his family... LaBell: Well, my father’s background, going back his name was LaBell, came from the French Revolution. And some of the LaBell’s went to England, some went to Sweden. (unintelligible) And some came to the United States. And the funny part of it is that once we got to the United States here, my mother happened to read in the Swedish paper that there was a Dr. LaBell up in Connecticut. And Mom followed that up. And she wrote this doctor, and gave him the background of our family. And he wrote back. He says, it sounds as though you’re, you’re a part of the LaBell’s that migrated from France during such and such a period. And it so developed. (he laughs) SIGRIST: That’s interesting. So your father actually is of French derivation. LaBell: Right. Right. SIGRIST: What was his personality like? LaBell: He was, he was very nice. He was a very good father. Very, very dedicated. He was, he was for the family one hundred percent. And... SIGRIST: What... LaBell: Go ahead. SIGRIST: I’m sorry. Go ahead. LaBell: When we were over there, and before we came over here and when my sister died, my father wrote my mother and told her that he thinks the best thing for her to do is to come over to the United States. SIGRIST: When did he come to the United States? LaBell: He came over here in about 19, 1916. SIGRIST: So he had been here for a while... LaBell: Oh, yes. He worked up in Connecticut in one of the schools up there for a while. Then he came beck to New York. And while he was in New York he heard that the, the Hotel Irving out in Southampton, Long Island wanted someone to do the gardening. So Pop says, ‘Gee, I’d like to do that.’ So he applied for the position. He was accepted. They took him over there. And, of course, in 1920 he had accommodations for us and everything. So he wrote Mom, you come on over here and bring the boys with you. SIGRIST: What was he trained to do in Sweden? What had he been? LaBell: Well, this is going to strike you funny. He was a stone cutter. You know, they, they made these cobbles, these stones for the road. He’s go up to the mountains with a crew, and they would take these things and chop them up and straighten them out, and he was a stone cutter. And that was his job. And he enjoyed doing that. SIGRIST: Why do you suppose he came to America? LaBell: Well, he wanted, like everybody, come to America and make a new life for himself and, and possibly for his family. There was no future in, in Sweden for him. SIGRIST: Did he have relatives who were already here? LaBell: No. SIGRIST: He just came... LaBell: He just came right off the bat. SIGRIST: Do you know how long he had been married to your mother before he came? LaBell: Well, I was born, and I was the youngest at that time. And so with my other brothers they must have been married about fifteen, sixteen years before he came over (unintelligible). SIGRIST: So, so you pretty much grew up in Sweden anyway without your father... LaBell: Right, right. SIGRIST: ...he was here. Do you remember him writing to the family? LaBell: Well, no, except that my mother would say that my fa, your father send his love to you. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Did he ever send you a gift from America? LaBell: No. No, he didn’t make that kind of money. Salary those days was very, very small. As a matter of fact when we came over here his salary out in Southampton was seventy dollars a month. And he had no vacation. He worked seven days a week, twelve hours a day. And he, that man really worked. There was no kidding around about it. He had to mow the grass around the hotel, he had to take care of the garden. He had two men working with him. And he supervised them. And he really worked, worked. And then he had to milk the cows, and feed the chickens. (he laughs) He really, he, he really worked hard. And then my mother would help out. The hotel had a laundry. So they, Mom says, well, I can do some ironing and things like that. So the hotel says, okay fine, because some of the guests would like to have their clothes washed and ironed and returned. And they’d bring their wash over. And, of course, they’d have one crew doing the personal wash for the guests, and then they’d bring the clothes over to Mother. And she would iron them and then stack them up, and put them back in the things to go back to the guests in the hotel. And then she did that, and she started work at seven o’clock in the morning till seven o’clock at night. Twelve hours a day. And then she would come and she would feed us. (he laughs) They, they really put out. Honest and truly sometimes I, I really cry thinking about it, because it’s, it’s such a great thing. SIGRIST: It’s a good thing she had a lot of energy. LaBell: Oh, she did. (they laugh) SIGRIST: Let’s go back to Sweden. Name your brothers and sisters for me from the oldest to the youngest girl who was born in this country. LaBell: John was the oldest. SIGRIST: Is that his Swedish name? LaBell: Johan. That’s J-O-H-A-N, Johan. And then there was George, which was Jarl, J-A-R-L. Fritz was his real name. And then it was Signe Matilda Oleana LaBell. That was the sister who died in Sweden. And then little Bihle, B-I-H-L-E, Arnold Erik came along. And I became the youngest. And then when we came over here to the United States, my sister that I have in this household now, she, she was born in 1921, September the 9th. SIGRIST: And what was her name? LaBell: Signe, S-I-G-N-E. SIGRIST: I see. LaBell: And she, she... SIGRIST: Was she named after the, the sister who died? LaBell: Yes. Right. Right. SIGRIST: I’d like to talk about what you remember about the death of your sister. First of all, what did she die from? LaBell: Well, my sister and I were very close, because we used to play out in the back or front of the house. And we had a lot of fun. And there’s one day just before she got sick. We were out there playing, and Signe said to me in Swedish, ‘I don’t feel good.’ So I says, ‘Well, why don’t you go in and rest.’ She went in and rested, and then Mom came home that night. She was a little upset that Signe wasn’t feeling good. So he, she, then the next day stayed home, and she called up the doctor and the doctor came. And he said to him, ‘Well, your daughter has diphtheria.’ And he says, ‘I’ll give her an injection and that should take care of it.’ So he says, ‘I’ll think I’m going to give her two injections.’ And after she had the injections she got out of bed and she was walking around. And I was outside playing, and I waved to her. And she waved back to me. And she was happy. But she was so sorry that she couldn’t be outside there playing with me. So then that night she went to sleep and she never woke up the next morning. The medication was too strong for her heart and she died. SIGRIST: How old was she? LaBell: She was about, I’d say she was about seven, seven and a half. SIGRIST: And how old were you? LaBell: Just about five. SIGRIST: This is really just before you came... LaBell: Yeah, right. SIGRIST: ...that you were so... LaBell: Yeah. A couple of months before we came over here. SIGRIST: Tell me what, how that affected your mother and, and the situation with the family. LaBell: Well, we were all, we were all very saddened by it. And, of course, my father made the suggestion that we come over here to America. It was a great responsibility for my mother to get the, get the three of us lined up to come. And... SIGRIST: But this was a great reason for her to come. LaBell: Right, right. SIGRIST: I mean, she’d lost the child and she’s unhappy. LaBell: Of course, Pop said that you had better treatment over here in the United States than you have in Sweden, and I don’t want you to stay over there by yourself. SIGRIST: Was that a common problem at that time? Diphtheria? LaBell: It was, yes. Ever since I was (unintelligible). As a matter of fact Mom was scared that I was going to get, too. But then it didn’t hit me. SIGRIST: In fact, and you mentioned that your aunt lost two children also... LaBell: Well, that was, it was just... SIGRIST: Was that different, though? LaBell: Yeah. They, they didn’t die from diphtheria. They died in child birth or else they die shortly after child birth. And my... SIGRIST: I see. So they died as babies. LaBell: Yeah. And they had quite a few sets of twins. And my uncle always passed the remark. He says, ‘You know,’ he says, ‘It’s all right to raise a family. But when they come two at a time,’ he says, ‘It’s too expensive.’ (he laughs) SIGRIST: Good thing he had a big farm. Tell me what you remember about the funeral practices at that time for your sister, or for anything. LaBell: Well, it, well, it was very simple. It isn’t like we have here. It was at, she was laid out at the house. It was a plain, ordinary wood coffin. And this minister came, did the service, and then the coffin was closed, and she would be put aboard the, sort of a horse drawn wagon, and taken to the cemetery, and she was buried. And, of course, we felt very, very bad about it. So, I wanted to go back these years ago to pay my respects to her, but the boss didn’t want to go. (they laugh) SIGRIST: Is, is there a mourning period in Swedish culture after someone dies? LaBell: Well, there is, there is a mourning period, because we, there was very little activity as far as the house was concerned. We were very sad and depressed for about thirty days. And then, of course, we got out of the shell and got back into regular things. Mother went to visit her friends and things. And when we had, we had to go the store, we had to walk about a quarter of a mile up the main highway. We had to walk down this winding road down to the main road, then walk the other way opposite from my uncle’s farm to go to the store. And then we come back with our stuff, bring it into the house. And it was good. SIGRIST: Can you, speaking of your house, can you describe the house for me? What it was made out of and what the layout of the house was? LaBell: Well, it was just a, sort of a one, one story house, and it was sort of long and flat. And you come out in the front, and the first thing you see is an, an open space I’d say about fifty, sixty feet, and then you see the mountain going up. And there was like a ledge there. And we used to love going up on that ledge then come running down. And it was, we really had an awful lot of fun. And the, the house, then the back of the house, over in the back, there was a barn. There was a barn, formerly used. But not used to today. (unintelligible) And up to the barn there was still some hay. And what we had, we had an apple tree. And we’d go and take the apples that we got and brought, (unintelligible), and brought them up into the barn and put them in the hay, and then they would sweeten in there. And we would go up there a couple of weeks later and pick them up. And boy, I tell you, you never had apples like that in your life. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Did you grow any food? Did you... LaBell: No, we didn’t have any farm. SIGRIST: And the apple just happened to be there? LaBell: Yeah, yeah. It was a part of the place. Mom, we rented the place. I don’t know how much she paid in rent, but whatever it was it was very nominal, because it didn’t amount to much. SIGRIST: How did you light the house on the inside? LaBell: We had carbonated lamp. It, it, we didn’t have electricity. And then we had a coal stove. Wood stove. Mom would bake, heat up the thing. That’s why they had the community bake oven, bakery where they baked cakes, because they (unintelligible), and they a big oven, and big stove. They could do all their cooking there rather than have individuals. And it would be less work for the individuals. And the men would be there taking care of the furnace while the ladies were baking cake. (he laughs) SIGRIST: Well, and, of course, there’s always the expense of fire wood and stuff you wouldn’t have to... LaBell: Right, right. Yeah. SIGRIST: How many rooms did the house have? LaBell: Oh, we had, I think it was four rooms. George, John and I slept in one room, and Mom and Signe slept in the other room. Then we had the living room and the kitchen. SIGRIST: Did you have running water inside the house? LaBell: No. We had to got out and pump out water. SIGRIST: Uh-huh. LaBell: We had sort of a retainment well inside that we had water to drink and everything like that. SIGRIST: What about toilet facilities. LaBell: They, that was an outhouse. We had no flush toilet. And bathing, well, then you had to stand in, in the kitchen, and you had one of these great, big washtubs you call them. You stand there, and then you sponge down. And that’s how you take a shower or a bath. (he laughs) We had no bathtub. SIGRIST: How often would you bathe? LaBell: That would be about twice a week. SIGRIST: And was this sort of big family thing? Everybody got in line... LaBell: No. Well, you pick your own days. In other words, you go, the one go, I used to enjoy taking a bath almost every day, but Mom says it was too much, because she had to carry the water around, you know. And we had no place to pour the water. You had to take it out in the back yard and dump. (he laughs) SIGRIST: What about furniture in the house? Does any furniture stick out in your mind as being very distinctive? LaBell: No. There was just the usual chairs and beds and sofa and some pictures. And we had a, a victrola. So we had music. Swedish music. And it was nice. And the stove was an old wood burning stove, and it had three sections on it. It had an oven, and it was enjoyable. SIGRIST: What about, what about the floor? What kind of flooring did it have? LaBell: It had real plank like flooring. Like something like that over there. (he indicates) It’s like all wood... SIGRIST: Just planks? LaBell: Right. Yeah. Very nice. SIGRIST: Do you remember, I assume the winters were cold. LaBell: They were cold, yeah. SIGRIST: Can you describe for me what a typical winter would be like, and how you would protect yourself? LaBell: Well, to be honest with you, being about five years old at the time, I don’t recall too much of the winter, because I managed to keep, keep warm, and keep on the go. But Mother made sure that, made sure that we had plenty of clothes on when we got out side. And it was never a situation where we were snow bound, by being in the house. Mother would always see to it that we could get out and run around and frolic a little bit. So that was it. But we never, she didn’t have too much trouble with the winters as far as I could recall. Though my brothers went skiing from our, in, in our house, you know, in the mountain that we had. And my uncle made them each a pari of skis. And I asked my uncle to make me a pair. He says, ‘Billy,’ he says, ‘I can’t make you a pair, because your mother won’t let me.’ Because I was too young. So I says, ‘Okay, fine.’ So what I did, I took two barrel hoops, you know, those orange slivers, things. I made two of those, got two of those, tied them to my shoe, tie, took some rope, and I went up on top of the mountain, and went to tie them on my, my foot. And my uncle come by, and he saw me. And he got up there. And he says, ‘Now, what do you think you’re doing?’ Says, ‘I’m going to ski.’ So he says, ‘You can’t ski with that.’ He says, ‘What’s the matter with you? You, the rope is going to be in your way, you haven’t got anything smooth to go on.’ So I says, ‘Well, I want to ski.’ He says, ‘Oh, no, no.’ He says, ‘Instead, I’ll make you a sled.’ So he made me a sled. (he laughs) And I had more fun with that than I (unintelligible). It worked out all right. SIGRIST: What religion was your family? LaBell: Lutheran. SIGRIST: And were you practicing Lutherans, or... LaBell: Well, yes. We, we went to church on Sundays. SIGRIST: There was a church in town? LaBell: No. We had to walk about two miles. And it, it was, it was nice. It was real good. And, of course, every night before we went to bed, Mother would read the Bible and have a little prayer with us. So we were a religious family. Yeah. SIGRIST: Is there a prayer that you remember in Swedish? LaBell: No. That was... SIGRIST: Too long ago. (he laughs) LaBell: Too long ago was right. SIGRIST: What about Christmas? How did you celebrate Christmas? LaBell: Well, Christmas would be usually a family thing. We’d go over to my uncle’s house because he had the facilities. He had the big house and big family, and we all got together with him. And the first thing you come in for you, you come in to see, ‘Yule Bugge,’ That was at Christmas. That’s Yula, Y-U-L-A, Bugge, B- U-G-G-E, Bugge. See, a Yule Bugge. That’s, idea to give you a feeling of Christmas. Then he’d hand out little presents. So you get a little box of candy or you get a piece of cake or something like that, just as a symbol of Christmas, you know. So, and then, then my aunt would arrange to have a Christmas Eve part, supper before we go to church. And there it would be the same thing. It was very nice. It would be lutfisk. And there would be all kinds of delicacies that you could have to eat before you go to church. SIGRIST: And lutfisk is a type of fish something? LaBell: Fish. Right, right. Right SIGRIST: Can you describe what exactly it is? I’ve always wanted to know. LaBell: Well, it’s almost like, I don’t know what you could say. Cod. Take cod, cod, and just break, cook it, they, they don’t fry it or anything or bake it. They just cook it. And you put it out and put little decorations around it, and make it a little attractive, and eat it, and it’s very good. SIGRIST: Now, would they have used Christmas trees in Sweden, or did you have anything like that? LaBell: Oh, no, yeah, they had like a little, Christmas, Christmas tree. But then, there wouldn’t be an extent to like they do here. Here we go overboard by having these big Christmas trees in the house. But over there it’s just a little ornament that you’d have to want to symbolize Christmas. It was very, very interesting. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO SIGRIST: Well, so your father’s in America, and your sister died, and he suggests that maybe... LaBell: Be better off... SIGRIST: ...the rest of you should come. LaBell: Right. SIGRIST: How did your mother initially feel about leaving Sweden do you think? LaBell: Well, she didn’t feel like leaving it, but then, she said, after it’s her husband. And her husband’s children. And I, that comes before her family. So she says, ‘We will go. Though we go with sadness, we will go.’ And we went. SIGRIST: What do you remember, what did you know about America when you were in Sweden? How did you envision America? LaBell: (he laughs) Nothing. I didn’t have the slightest idea what we were getting into. I, I, even my brothers even said, they didn’t know where they were going to go. So we got on a boat. We went down to Goteborg, Sweden... SIGRIST: What do you remember about the, before you went down to, to Goteborg, what do you remember about getting ready to go? LaBell: Well, Mom, Mom had to get rid of all the furnishings she had in the house. She had to get rid of all the extra clothes that we had. Bedclothes and everything, of course, she couldn’t take that with her. SIGRIST: How did she do that? LaBell: Well, neighbors who needed some stuff, why then, she let them have it. And they can help themselves. So the house was already cleaned out. And when we left there that morning we just had what was on the bed. So we got up and got dressed and got, went. (he laughs) We were on our way to Goteborg to... SIGRIST: Now you said there was a party before you left? LaBell: Right. On Saturday. SIGRIST: Did, did anyone give you a present for you to remember Sweden by? LaBell: No. Nobody said, they, all they said was lots of luck, may God bless all. SIGRIST: Do you remember what your mother packed, what you had that you wanted to take with you to America? LaBell: Well, all we took was was just a change or two of clothes. And we had what we call a utika [PH]. It’s like a suitcase, big suitcase, where, closed together, two sides. And she fixed that up. And then she carried that plus the fact that she had those three kids. And it wasn’t an awful lot, because we figured, well, we would only be only for a couple days. But it took us twelve days to come to America. SIGRIST: Well, how long did it take you to get down to Goteborg before you... LaBell: It took, oh, it just took us a couple of hours. That’s all. SIGRIST: How did you get there? LaBell: By train. SIGRIST: Had you been on a train before? LaBell: Never. SIGRIST: Does anything stick out in your mind about that? LaBell: No. It was, it was just comfortable, because I think we were all tired. We slept. (he laughs) We slept on the train. We got to Goteborg and... SIGRIST: So there are three kids, right? LaBell: Right. SIGRIST: There are three boys that she’s... LaBell: Three boys, yeah. SIGRIST: ...taking. Did anyone travel with you to Goteborg before you left? LaBell: No. No, we left all by, all by ourselves. SIGRIST: I see. What happened before you got on the ship? LaBell: Well, Mom had to go and sign in on the, on the, at the office that she was there, and with her children, and they took her luggage and put it to one side. And then we had to stand with my mother till we got boarding orders. And then when we got, once we got aboard boat we were assigned to rooms, and that’s where we, we went to our rooms, and... SIGRIST: You didn’t have to stay overnight then in, in Goteborg? LaBell: No, we, no, we just came down, we got on the boat, and the boat left late in the afternoon. SIGRIST: What was the name of the boat, do you know? LaBell: The Stockholm. SIGRIST: I’ll have to write that down. And... LaBell: S.S. Stockholm. SIGRIST: And tell me, tell me what it was like for a six year old to be on this ship for the first time. What, what did you think when you saw it? LaBell: Well, I, I didn’t see the ship to be honest with you. (he laughs) But we were like in a shedded [sic] area, and we got aboard the boat, and we got in there, we went into our room where we were assigned, our rooms, and there were really bunks that we slept in. And we stayed there. And we went and got, ate in the dining room. There, they had like a little opening so that you could go and have your lunch and your breakfast and supper if you wanted. And I think that the whole feeling was that we wanted to get to America, and we weren’t concerned about the luxuries of life aboard the boat. So we, we did have it, though. And, of course, Mom didn’t have too much money with her so she couldn’t do too much. So as it worked out it worked out very well. SIGRIST: Do you remember eating on the boat? LaBell: Well, just a little bit. Just a little bit, because I said I got a little seasick, too. And my brother’s got seasick, too. And so Mom had her crow [sic] with us and cheese, (unintelligible), but we got, we got over it all right. We got to America here in twelve days. SIGRIST: Twelve days. What time of the year is this that you’re travelling? LaBell: Oh, about the, we left the 18th of May from Goteborg. My birthday. My sixth... SIGRIST: I was going to say, you just turned six. LaBell: Right. Six years old. And we landed here on the thirtieth of May. And I’ll never forget, we got off the boat, and we no sooner got off the boat, and I says, ‘Oh, boy, now we’re going to see Papa.’ And Mother says, ‘No, we’re not, because they herd us off here to Ellis Island.’ And we got here, and when we got to the island here, why, they, we were, my mother was told she could not take my brother John and George with her. They were too old. So they, she, they went to the more adult side for the men’s part. And then... SIGRIST: Oh, I see. She couldn’t have them with her during the examinations. Okay. LaBell: Right. Right. So they stayed there, and then she and I went over to her side. And then the next day we got up, they called us out, and they called our names, and then we, they said that we can now go back on the mainland. So we went, went to New York. We got into New York, and we no sooner got off the boat than walked in, we were like on the, on the deck, area there. I looked over and there I saw a bunch of soldiers on the other side of like a fenced, chicken fenced area. And one fellow, (unintelligible) like James Cagney. And he waved to me, and I waved back to him. And then he did this way to me. (he gestures) He waved me over. So I walked over, and he says, he must have said, where are you from. And I says, I had a Swedish sailor outfit on with a cap on, and then with a cap with a name, Sverige, S-V-E-R-I-G-E, on, on the top. So he says, ‘What’s that?’ I says, ‘Sverige.’ So he says, ‘Oh.’ So with that he gives me a nickel. And he, he must have said, welcome to America, because he was all smiles, and I waved to him, he waved to me, and he threw me a kiss. And he was such a nice man. I wish I could see him today. (he laughs) Seventy-five years later. (he laughs) SIGRIST: That’s a great story. LaBell: So, if you see, if you see, hear this tape. (he laughs) SIGRIST: That’s right. If you’re out there. Stranger things have happened. LaBell: Right. SIGRIST: Let’s go back a little bit to before they let you off of Ellis Island. You said you stayed there overnight here. LaBell: Yeah. SIGRIST: What happened to you here that you can remember? What kind of examinations... LaBell: Well, they just check, check your eyes, your mouth, your ears, and see if you have any sores or anything like that. Everything was clear. And they looked at the passport and they examined everything, your feet, to be sure that you didn’t have anything that would be injurious to the people in the United States. Some people were held up. So we were very fortunate, all five, four of us. SIGRIST: Do you remember when, when your brothers were told that they had to separate from you and your mother, do you remember how your mother reacted to that, if she understood, or... LaBell: Well, she, well she, she was a little disappointed. But then it was explained to her by a lady who spoke English and Swedish that that is the procedure, that they go through here on the island, so, ‘We’ll take care of your sons. Don’t you worry about it.’ And with that assurance she let them go. But I’ll tell you what happened when we got off in, in New York, and we start making our way to our destination. A man came over to our mother and said, ‘Where are you going?’ And Mom says, ‘We’re heading for Southampton, Long Island.’ So he says, ‘You got money? I’ll go over and buy tickets for you. How many are you?’ So we, Mother says, ‘There’s me and then my three children.’ He says, ‘Okay.’ So he went over and he bought the tickets. Came back, and he gave Mom the change and the tickets. So then a lady was standing there and she says, ‘May I see those tickets?’ So Mom showed the tickets to her. And she says, ‘Do you know where you’re going?’ So Mom says, ‘Yeah, I’m going to Southampton, Long Island.’ She says, ‘Well, what are going to do with Chicago tickets?’ Mom says, ‘Chicago?’ ‘Yeah. These tickets aren’t for you. You want Southampton. I’ll go over and changed them.’ She went over to the ticket agent and changed them to Southampton and got a refund. And she came back and she said, ‘That fellow was not doing you any favors.’ So we says, she says, you, then my mother says, ‘Now, where do I get the train to get to Southampton?’ She says, ‘I’ll take you up to Penn Station.’ So we got up to Penn Station, and there we got on a train, and in three hours we were out in Southampton, and we no sooner got off the train that I saw my father come running. (he laughs) He saw the family, and he was so happy. He grabbed my mother and he grabbed us, and he, he was so happy, that we went there and stayed in Southampton, Long Island. It was very nice. SIGRIST: You know, your father came to America prior to World War One? I mean, he came before... LaBell: No, World War One was in... SIGRIST: Had it started already? LaBell: Oh, yes. It... SIGRIST: Oh, he came in 1916. Right. So the war was already starting. LaBell: Right. SIGRIST: I was just wondering, I didn’t ask you back then, did the war affect your family in any way, like your older brother, or... LaBell: No. No. SIGRIST: No? He was just young enough. LaBell: Right. He was just, well, over here you mean? SIGRIST: No, no, when you were still in Sweden if, if you... LaBell: No. No. We weren’t, we weren’t in the war. We had, the Germans were staying on the continent. They weren’t up into the Nordic country. SIGRIST: I see. LaBell: But then we did say, one time there was a, a display in the air. And we’re all out, standing outside, and we’re looking up into the sky. And Mother says, ‘I wonder what that could be.’ So one of the neighbors says, ‘That’s the Germans trying to scare us.’ (he laughs) It was, it was nice. Yeah. SIGRIST: So you made it to Southampton. Your father, you’re reunited with your father. Of course, you’ve never even met your father... LaBell: No. Well, I, I, my father knew me when I was born, because he left right as I was born. SIGRIST: But in terms of you remember him... LaBell: Right. SIGRIST: How did you, what was your initial reaction to your father? LaBell: Well, I was very happy to know that I had a father, and that he was my father, because my mother said that your father was a very nice man, and... SIGRIST: And you understood what all that meant? LaBell: Right. And I, well, Pop was very good. He was very good to us. He was very nice indeed. SIGRIST: What about your older brothers? How did they react to him having been away for so long? LaBell: Well, well, they knew the situation, that Pop was over here making money. And we were over there living on his earnings, which was not too much. So it was very good. SIGRIST: You said you were put up in the hotel? He had his own quarters in the hotel? LaBell: No. No. SIGRIST: No. LaBell: Pop rented an apartment on Elm Street in Southampton. And it was a, something like a four room apartment. It was two bedrooms, living room, and a dining room, and a kitchen and a bath. And the bath, of course, was a big hit, because we all wanted to sit in the tub at the same time. (he laughs) And we, we lived there for about a year. In the meantime at the hotel where my father worked as the head gardener, they renovated an old, an old building, and they rented a five room apartment upstairs for Pop. And then we moved in there. And that’s where then my mother got involved with the laundry, because the laundry was like in back of the house. So that worked out all right. And then, but then we saw, Pop took us over for a walk in the hotel grounds, and he showed, showed us where he lived before we came over. And I’m telling I was, I was devastated. I was just disgusted. Because he had a small room. I don’t think it was more than about six by six, with a bed in there and a dresser, and that’s all that he had. With a little light in there. And he lived like a pauper. And I, I felt so bad that he had lived for so many under those conditions, for five years in those conditions. So now he was out in the free, and he was free to - (he laughs) - but he was, he was very nice. He, and... SIGRIST: Tell me about starting school. Did they put you in school right away, or did you wait through the summer, and then... LaBell: No. Waited through the summer, and then August my father had to take me to the school. I went to Southampton New School. And while we were there I was registered in, and Mrs. Sabine came in... SIGRIST: Mrs.? LaBell: Sabine, S-A-B-I-N-E, came in. And she said to my father, ‘And who is this little man?’ So my father says, ‘That’s my son from Sweden. So he just came over here in May. End, end of May.’ So Mr. Sabine, ‘Well, it’s nice to, and how are you, sonny?’ And during the summer when I was there I couldn’t play with the kids out in the street or out in the yard, because I, I spoke Swedish, they spoke English. And all they said to me was go to hell. So when he said to me, now, how are you today, so I said to him, ‘You go to hell.’ (he laughs) So, he, he said to my father, (unintelligible) that’s what the kids say to him when he went to play ball with him. (unintelligible) So when I started school in the fall, and I’m going through the hall, and Mr. Sabine come walking down, and he sees me, he says, ‘Well, if this isn’t my ‘go to hell’ boy.’ (he laughs) (unintelligible) But his son, Jack Sabine, and I became very good friends. We, it was just a great, great life. It was real nice. SIGRIST: Tell me, you mentioned before we started recording about the change in your name occurring when you went to school. LaBell: Yeah. SIGRIST: Can you just tell that story again for us? Your name was originally spelled how? LaBell: Originally the name is capital L-E-, capital B-E-L. That’s when they migrated from France to Sweden. SIGRIST: B-E-L, one L or two L’s? LaBell: One L. SIGRIST: One l. LaBell: Hm-hmm. And that’s when they went, migrated to Sweden. Then when they were in Sweden in changed there from capital L-E to capital B-E-L-L. We came over here on L, capital L-E, capital B-E-L-L. Then when we signed up for school it became capital L-A, capital B-E-L-L. And we were told, I said, ‘Well, that isn’t the right name. It’s L-E.’ ‘Oh, it doesn’t make any difference.’ (he laughs) It won’t make any difference. SIGRIST: It’s been so changed, changed so many times that it... LaBell: Right. So anyway, we, we then adopted the name. My oldest brother and George, George I think, and John took the old name, L-E B-E-L-L, and I took stuck to L-A B-E-L-L. So I took it for my social security, I told them that, and they, they accepted my application for social security as L-A, capital B-E-L-L. It worked out all right. And even I went to school, college and everything. SIGRIST: Tell me about, I’d like to talk a little bit about that first year school and what it was like for you to finally learn English. Did your father speak English? LaBell: Well, he, he had a, a limited amount of, of English. And he, he, he got along all right. And he managed to make, make ends meet. But the family... SIGRIST: I mean, we know you can say go to hell. (he laughs) LaBell: Yeah. Well, when I went to school, I paid attention to what, I started in kindergarten. And the big, big thing I liked in kindergarten was that you got plenty of time to play, because they had all kinds of games, and they had books you looked at, and they had this story and that story, and they really tried to get you into it, you know. And they knew that I couldn’t speak English, but I did the best I could. And even the people, the Mr. Terry who had the hotel had a daughter, Elizabeth. And Elizabeth was, well, about sixteen, seventeen years of age. And she took a liking to me. And what we did, she taught me English. She would tell me what to say, when to say it, and everything like that. She was very good. And what we used to do, we used to play ball, I would have a catch with her. And we would go walking together, we talked. Then when she got into high school I was the messenger between her and her boyfriend. She’d give me a note for her boyfriend, and then I’d have to wait at Arthur’s house to get a note to go back. (he laughs) So I was her means of communication. And we, she was very nice. SIGRIST: Can you tell me perhaps words that were difficult for you to learn? Do you, any stick out in your mind? LaBell: No. They, no, the words aren’t too difficult. I was told just use simple, simple American language, and you wouldn’t worry, you know, you wouldn’t, you’d be able to express your, your feelings. SIGRIST: Tell me about your mother. Did she learn English? LaBell: Well, she learned English, it’s funny, I’ll tell you this story. She said that she didn’t speak English very well. But one time we had company out in Southampton. And these people just came over from Sweden. And they were just visiting. And they came out to see Mom and Pop and us. So as they were sitting in the dining room having coffee and cake, they started a conversation. Well, before you know it, my mother started rattling off English like a, it came right out of her mouth like nothing. (he laughs) I says, ‘Mom, they don’t understand English. Talk to them in Swedish.’ She says, ‘Oh, they understand.’ (he laughs) Then she realized she made a mistake. She, she talked Swedish. But she could speak English all right. SIGRIST: How did she learn English? LaBell: Well, she worked with people. And then she had Swedish girls that did, that were English, well versed in English. And they helped her out with her speech and everything, and she did very well. SIGRIST: Did she ever attend night classes or anything like that? LaBell: No. No. They didn’t have that in those days. Seventy-five years ago. They didn’t have that. It, she, she wanted to, but then she says, ‘No, I’ll have to,’ and then of course, she picked up when my sister was born here in the United States. And when she started going to school my sister would more or less give her a little more background on English and everything. So she... SIGRIST: The parents learned from the children? LaBell: Right, right. SIGRIST: Yeah. LaBell: Right. SIGRIST: Did your mother like America? LaBell: Yeah, she enjoyed it over here very much. She enjoyed here. But she, her heart was still in Sweden. SIGRIST: And, and what did she do to stay in contact with Sweden? LaBell: Well, she corresponded with her sister over there. And also she had her sister-in-law and brother over there. And she had relatives, friends, other relatives there like aunts and uncles. So that, that worked out all right. But she want, she wanted to go back. But Pop says, no, not even for a visit we won’t go back. So she says, okay, we’ll stay here then. SIGRIST: So she never made it back even for a visit? LaBell: No, no. No. No. Seventy-five years later I’m in the same boat. I can’t go back. SIGRIST: Well, tell me a little bit about, were your brothers put into school in lower grades than they should have been? LaBell: No, they, they were in the right grades. SIGRIST: No. Had they learned any English in Sweden in school? LaBell: No. No. No. They didn’t have any English over there then. Now they, the, the students over there can take as a choice of American English. SIGRIST: Were there any things in America that you came in contact with that you had never seen before, that were, were new to you? Maybe foods, or devices of some sort? LaBell: Well, I, I don’t really know, because you, you didn’t have too much when you’re six years old, how many experiences. Coming over here you just follow the trend that you’re in. SIGRIST: How long did your father work at the hotel? LaBell: Well, he worked there from, I’d say about sixteen years. SIGRIST: Oh, so you were there for into your adulthood then? LaBell: Well, no. Well, he worked there for, he, we (unintelligible) when I was about sixteen years old, came from New York. And while I was at the hotel, and I got over, about eleven or twelve years of age, I and another fellow, Harry Bethel, we worked, and we were, we prepared vegetables for the hotel. We strung string beans, we peeled the potatoes, we get the peas out of the pea, pea pod, and we cleaned the celery. And then when had twelve years of age I was told that I should help the steward, so I helped the steward, and I fixed up stuff in the store room, and I pulled the ice downstairs. They had a little ice machine that made cakes of ice. I pulled the cakes of ice out of the forms, and then I’d refill them so that they would freeze up again. And I worked, and for the whole summer I’d get, maybe get seventy-five dollars for the whole summer long. (he laughs) And then after the second year, third year, they put me in charge of the washing machine, and I washed dishes. And they had a... SIGRIST: Can you describe what the washing machine looked like? LaBell: It was sort of a square box. And you had this tray. And you put the plates in, and saucers and everything and cups. And you just shove it in there, and you turn it on the machine, and it washes, and you throw a little soap on top, rinse it, and it comes out on this side. Then you take the things off. Then you take the plates, cups and everything, carry them over to the steam closet, and they stay in the steam closet till they’re needed again. They come out again. So that’s what I did that for a year... SIGRIST: This hotel really got its money’s out of the LaBell family. (he laughs) LaBell: Oh, they got more than what. Then... SIGRIST: What was the name of the hotel? LaBell: Hotel Irving. SIGRIST: The Hotel Irving. That’s right. You said that. LaBell: Hotel Irving in Southampton, Long Island. SIGRIST: I see. LaBell: I don’t know (unintelligible), but my sister thought, well, she’s in Southold, and she tells me it’s no longer a hotel, it’s a condominium. SIGRIST: Oh. LaBell: So. But... SIGRIST: Did you ever go back to Sweden? Did you ever want to as an adult? LaBell: No. No. I wanted to go back now, but such isn’t the case. I’ll tell you about the hotel. I remember when a person, John Kennedy first got married, he and his wife came out to the hotel and stayed at the Hotel Irving. And we were coming back from the ocean, and we passes by the hotel. And there’s John Kennedy chasing his wife on the porch on the outside of the hotel. And I said, ‘Oh, there’s President, young Senator Kennedy.’ And sure enough it was. (he laughs) He’s a great guy. SIGRIST: How do you think your life would have been different if you had never come to America? LaBell: Well, I don’t think that I would be as well off over there as I am today here, because the opportunities in Sweden weren’t as great, as open as they are here. Here I think that it’s a great gift in the United States if you want to really take advantage. I worked forty-five years for my company, for the American Metal Company. SIGRIST: The American? LaBell: Metal Company. SIGRIST: Metal Company. LaBell: Originally American Metal Company. Then it became American Metal Climax. Then it became Amax. And now it Cyprus Amax Minerals Company in Denver, Colorado. So... SIGRIST: But you worked there for forty-five years with that company? LaBell: Forty-five years while I was in New York. SIGRIST: Wow. LaBell: I retired 1979. SIGRIST: Oh, you’ve been retired for a while. LaBell: Sixteen years. SIGRIST: When did you get married? LaBell: 1937. May, May 22nd, 1937. SIGRIST: And what was your wife’s name? LaBell: Alice Mildred. SIGRIST: Maiden name? LaBell: Ross. R-O-S-S. SIGRIST: And children? LaBell: No children. SIGRIST: No children. And did you ever maintain any Swedish at all, language, as an adult? LaBell: Well, only when we got together with my brothers and my cousins. They came over. And when they, they came over here to this country they stayed with us in the Bronx, I mean in Harlem. And they had, they, they didn’t want to pay board. So my mother says, ‘Well, who do you think is buying, paying for the food. You’ve got to get a job.’ Well, then they went and they had to go and get a job someplace. So they got jobs as painters, and they did this and they did that, and they finally made a go of it themselves. But they’re all dead, too, now, so. SIGRIST: Did any other members of your family, or your, your mother or father’s family I should say, come to America to live after you did? LaBell: Well, yeah, my cousins did. SIGRIST: The cousins did. LaBell: Right. The cousins did. SIGRIST: And they, they didn’t go back? They stayed? LaBell: They didn’t go back, yeah. SIGRIST: Did they come here because of the example that you had set? LaBell: No, I think it’s a feeling themselves, that they wanted to come to America and make a living for themselves and everything. So it’s an unfortunate thing, but that’s where it is. Opportunities in Europe isn’t as great as they are here in the United States. If you have the ability here you can go far. But it’s up to the individual. SIGRIST: Mr. LaBell, I think that’s probably a good place to, to end the interview. I want to thank you very much. LaBell: Oh, okay. SIGRIST: And, Mr. LaBell, for your patience while you sat here. (they laugh) This is Paul Sigrist signing off with William LaBell on April 6th, 1995, using the digital machine in the recording studio. Thank you very much, sir. LaBell: Okay, fine.
