LEVINE: Can you spell that? SKAPIK: Well, no. Matt. LEVINE: You want, you can write it out afterwards... SKAPIK: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got seven passports over there. LEVINE: Oh, okay. Okay, so tell me about the town where you, where you grew up. What do you remember about it? SKAPIK: Well, I went to school, but I don’t remember much, because we, I’m Slovak. And we had everything Hungarian in the school, except one day catechismus [sic]. That was in the Slovak language. The rest of it was all in Hungarian, because lot of that place belonged to the Austria, so... LEVINE: So you spoke Slovak at home? SKAPIK: Oh, home, yes. LEVINE: And then when you went to school you learned Hungarian? SKAPIK: Yes. Well, we can speak, but reading books, that’s all we had Slovak in the catechism. That was in the Slovak. The rest of (unintelligible) was, one day a week we had speaking Slovak, yeah. But it was Hungarian. LEVINE: What was the, what, was your family a religious family? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: Very religious. LEVINE: And what did, how did they observe the religion? Like what did you do of a religious nature? SKAPIK: Well, we pray a lot and go to church every chance we get, and read catechi, catechismus [sic], (unintelligible). And we pray awful lot, home we pray by ourselves (unintelligible) rosary and all that. (unintelligible) religious. LEVINE: Was there a Catholic church in your, in your town? SKAPIK: Yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah. LEVINE: Was it a big town or was it a village? SKAPIK: It was a, it was a pretty, pretty well town. There was another one, small town they call it. Yeah, that was a smaller than I, because when they want to see like a big office, they have to come to our school, they have, oh, what do you call it, small offices there. But when it, (unintelligible) it’s a large office that they have something filled out they have to come to our town, because... LEVINE: I see. SKAPIK: ...that was like a second hand. That was a ‘Dolde [PH]’ or a (unintelligible). Dolde is like a, well, what would you call a Dolde. Like a, well, well, I don’t know what you say they’re like, but the town where that was Dolde Oroshane [PH]. It was Oroshane, but it, it was much smaller than our Oroshane, so. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Now when you, when you were a little, do, do you, well, what did you father do for work? SKAPIK: He was farming. They, they, all, all men work for the, the baron. And that was another town. That belonged to all the, all the, I don’t know how many acres of land. So these people that worked for this baron, and they get paid by day. And my father was a, he’s got a farm. Beautiful, beautiful pair of, pair of horses. That was, that was not his. He, he was take care of them, and he worked with them. LEVINE: Uh-huh. What, what kind of farm was it? What did they... SKAPIK: They grow everything. Everything. Everything. Potatoes and all, all vegetables. All vegetables and grain. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: And, and you remember those two horses? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yes, because anytime we get a chance he take us, take us for a ride. And what we, well, what he does, he was very particular about his horses. And they were beautiful. And that’s why he was chosen to go to the next town where the, where the baron live. He used to bring wine and whatever we grow in our Orashane, he carried out every day food from our town to there, because lot of, lot of stuff that we grow, they don’t grow where the baron live. He had a big castle there. LEVINE: Oh. So he would bring the, the food that he... SKAPIK: My, my father was chosen because he had the most beautiful, clean horses, that, so he that was chosen from the baron, to come to do, the kitchen, and they rolled out, because he was bringing the food, and raise there a lot of the sheeps [sic]. So he bring a lot of meat over there and all that. So he’s got to be very, very particular about his carriage, and all that, so bring in the food over there. LEVINE: I see. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: So he really had, he was in a way privileged. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: That was a privilege to have that particular a job. SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. LEVINE: Yeah. Well, did, did the horses have names? Did he name the horses? SKAPIK: Just, just for himself. No, no, there, there wasn’t... LEVINE: That he really would have called them. SKAPIK: ...nothing, nothing particularly. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: So, did you have chores as a little girl? Did you have chores that you had to do? SKAPIK: Yeah. Oh, yes, I had to work out on the farm. LEVINE: Would that be what, like, picking vegetables, or... SKAPIK: Everything. Digging, digging, loosening the dirt, and then try to plant things, and all that, working in the, where they grow them grapes. We did one, raise a lot of grapes, making wine. LEVINE: Oh. SKAPIK: Yeah. So my father was even that, of bringing the barrels, and there the gallons of wine and, he always was chosen to bring it over to there. That was the next town. Take him about half an hour with the carriage with two horses. LEVINE: Do you remember the baron’s name? SKAPIK: I used to. LEVINE: Yeah. SKAPIK: Palfe. LEVINE: P-A-L-... SKAPIK: ...F-E. Palfe. Yeah, that was their name. Yeah, while we, he used to know all the, all the girls that (unintelligible), princesses or something. LEVINE: Did he have a big family? The baron had a big family? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He had, because he had two castles and then he’d live in the town, too. That’s where they, change of places. The castle was right on top of the mountain. And so my father knew them all, and he was telling us all about how that he can’t stand all the picking and best cookies and best meat and all that. He was, he was very, very fine (unintelligible) because he was more chosen from the, from the better, because he’s got a beautiful carr, piece of carriage. Well, it was a carriage, big, because he bringed [sic] a lot of food. Meat and wine and all that. LEVINE: Wow. Now was the wine made in your town? SKAPIK: Yes, it was made in our town. LEVINE: Did you ever see it being made? SKAPIK: Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I was right there with my father. (she laughs) LEVINE: Did you, can you tell me what it was like? What, what, what did they do... SKAPIK: Well, they, they had presses, some smaller, some big ones, but because each, like a small holiday, they make their own wine, use the small press. And when they make the gallons and gallons of wine it was, they’d use the big, big press to press that, the grapes, and end up running to the, to the pots, and all the other, the barrels, and it was very interesting. (she laughs) LEVINE: So was your father involved in that? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yeah. Of course, they didn’t, he didn’t, like I says, he didn’t work, am I talking too much? LEVINE: No, it’s fine. I was just making sure. No, go ahead. SKAPIK: See, he’s, he wasn’t working on the farm like, like other people. He was more most with the food bringing to the baron, the castles, after and all that. He was chosen for that, because he was very clean, and his horses were the best horses in the, in the miles and miles. And that was the baron wanted that’s one that clean horses. So it’s, well, he was, he was working the, also this town. Well, it was when I littler. I think he work in a factory about many, many (unintelligible) town. It was, oh, a lot of cattle, that was working in horses on the farm, but they were just working horses. But his was very, very, very special. Very special. LEVINE: Did, what kind of factory was it? SKAPIK: It was, when I was growing it was a vinegar factory. They make vinegar. And from that they, they make a, like a, a rubbing alcohol and all that. Different, these, and, and, because that was, that goes in, in a, like ovens. Big ovens. All that. That was in (unintelligible) that factory. And they were, even the, oh, well, anyway a lot of, a lot of liquor was chosen from, from the trees. They got the trees now and squeeze them and all that. That’s how they make the vinegar. And it was a very strong vinegar when they, when they pull three, three drops, that make it one cup of vinegar. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: Very, very, very strong. LEVINE: I see. SKAPIK: And later on there it used to call it chemical factory, and while I was growing up that was, that was mostly from wood. Vinegar and all that (unintelligible) what do you call that, vinegar factory. And like rubbing alcohol and all that. That was, that was all from the, from the trees. LEVINE: Do you, did you ever go to the castle? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. LEVINE: To the baron’s castle? SKAPIK: Yeah. Yes. LEVINE: Tell me what that was like. SKAPIK: Oh, very interesting. LEVINE: What did it look like? SKAPIK: Oh, my goodness, you can’t explain it. I was there 1947 and ‘48. LEVINE: Oh, you went... SKAPIK: When I went, after twenty-five years I went to first town to visit, and I was up there because their daughter and my nephew had a child (unintelligible) my sister, so, so he brought me up there was a great, big gate. You, you have to have something to let you in. So, well, I took my daughter, she was twenty-one years old, with me. LEVINE: Did you ever go to the castle when you were a little girl? Did your father ever take you? SKAPIK: No, not, not much, no, we weren’t allowed. We weren’t, no, just the special people, go, they was all gaping, so just look from the gates, and they’re all down (unintelligible) somebody and somebody and somebody. LEVINE: I see. Was it made out of stone? SKAPIK: Yes. Oh, yes. Everything was made out of stone. Yeah. Because it was already on top of the mountain. Yeah. I got pictures of it, some day, some day. And when I took my daughter there 1947 and ‘48, I take her up there. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: And she see what, what I used to visit with. It was my daughter, my father used to take us once in a while there, just permission from the baron, touch the finery. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Could you go inside the gate, or just... SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yeah. LEVINE: Yeah. SKAPIK: Yeah. Just, you have to know somebody there. LEVINE: Yeah. SKAPIK: Yeah, you have to know somebody. LEVINE: Wow. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: Well, how long did you stay in school? SKAPIK: Well, I stay in the school whole six years, but we didn’t, we didn’t have no teachers. All our teachers was a woman. LEVINE: One teacher? SKAPIK: We have two teachers, and one woman. But the woman, she didn’t get along with the, with the man teachers, so she left. And two men and there was another boy, he was a priest. There were three brothers and daughters, go to school. But, so, we didn’t, we didn’t have no, no, no, no teaching until, I went to first, second and third grade. That’s about all. The rest of the three grades, I was just, whatever we, what I read was all right. LEVINE: Oh. SKAPIK: It’s, it’s lot of, lot of, lot of, there, what they usually did, the priest and who (unintelligible) head of the school choose the one boy or one girl, smartest. So he tell them to read this and this, and which want to listen to him, we listen to him or not. So that’s, three years school, that’s what I had. I had first, second and third grade. That’s all. And a lot of the boys, the girls, (unintelligible) mother and father, want to get married, don’t care if they go to school or not. They don’t even learn to write and to read. My mother couldn’t read. She can, she can read, but she can’t write. Yeah. So. LEVINE: Now when, when you stop school after the six years, then what did you do? SKAPIK: Well, what I do, once in a while I work on the field. But what I do, I don’t know why they chose me, my sister and my brothers that, cooking. I was doing all the cooking. LEVINE: For the family? SKAPIK: From seven, eight years, I was making a bon fire, big pot of noodles, and a big pot of pheasant, because we got mostly soup and like noodles and things like that. We didn’t have no meat, on a Sunday. We have just, just a little piece of meat. Everybody just taste (unintelligible) make a pot of soup out of that. So during the week we had just everything made out of the flour. LEVINE: So did you bake bread and everything? SKAPIK: Yeah, well, that, that my mother did. But on the cooking, you had the food and all that, peeling the potatoes, and beans, and all that, that, that, that was my job. Cooking, cooking, cooking. But the... LEVINE: Do you remember any kinds of dishes that your mother or that you learned to make... SKAPIK: Oh, yes. I still make them. LEVINE: What? What is it? SKAPIK: (she laughs) Make blintzes. I make a lot of noodles, and the little, little pieces, they call it ‘harischkit [PH]’... LEVINE: What is that word? SKAPIK: Harischkit. (she laughs) LEVINE: Harischkit. SKAPIK: That’s a little dumplings. LEVINE: Oh, I... SKAPIK: He likes them. (she indicates her son) LEVINE: Yeah. He likes them? SKAPIK: So, I, what I used to do, when I was young, when I got married, because I have a Slovak husband. So... LEVINE: You married someone from the same place? SKAPIK: Yeah. Oh, yes. LEVINE: But after you came here? SKAPIK: Yeah. Oh, yes. I was only seventeen. And he start to go with me first week. LEVINE: First week you were here? (she laughs) Okay. I want to hear that story, but let’s, let’s talk a little bit more about when you were still in Europe. Do you remember the house you lived in? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. LEVINE: Yeah. Could you describe it? What did it look like? When you went in the door, the front door, what, what did you see? SKAPIK: Well, we have a, what they call, they used to call it open kitchen. That was in the middle. And then there was a big door, back room and front room. Because in the kitchen had chimney going all the way up to the roof. LEVINE: Was it one story, the house? One floor? SKAPIK: One story. One story. Yeah. LEVINE: And was it made out of stone? SKAPIK: Mostly, mostly stone. Yeah. Yeah. And the front room was beautiful, but we use it for sleeping anyway, because everybody had to have a bed for sleep. And then the kitchen, and others (unintelligible) the kitchen we always have a door open because it’s open kitchen. Because was right in our, our, not, not middle, it was a little bit further, from, from door, because that goes up to the roof. LEVINE: Now did you, what did you use for, to cook on? SKAPIK: Wood. LEVINE: Wood. SKAPIK: Wood. Yeah. LEVINE: You burned wood? SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: And was it like an iron stove, or it was like a fireplace? What was... SKAPIK: All the, built, house was built of stone, and it was just, just, well, brick, part of it was stones, most, most of it, most of, and mixed with sand and all that, oh, what do you call that... LEVINE: Like cement? SKAPIK: Cement, yeah. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And did you have like an oven? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We have oven. And we have oven, we have, well, we have oven, like in the kitchen, stove, but in a open kitchen that was done in the, in the wall. LEVINE: In the wall? SKAPIK: They baked bread. LEVINE: Oh. SKAPIK: Uh-huh. Yeah. Because they, they, they make a, well, big (unintelligible) there of four or five at once. Because they only baked that once a, once a week. Yeah. So that was, that was, oh, you have to have a big shovel to put the bread in the, in the, like a, like a, what do you call it, things that pull it out. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: Like a (unintelligible) Slovak. (she laughs) LEVINE: Yeah, they use that in pizza ovens... SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: ...here. They have, yeah, like a shelf. SKAPIK: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. LEVINE: And, and did you help you mother make the bread? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, I do, because I, I always was with her. So that’s why when I come to eight and nine years old, she went on the field and I used to do the cooking. When they come home from the supper, or it was lunch as they usually take something to, to have in a hurry, but supper was at six, five o’clock, (unintelligible) seven o’clock. They never know what they’re going to eat. And I just choose myself, because I know we get lot of beans and lentils and all that, so I (unintelligible) the soup. And that’s all right. When I make noodles here, you know what, I says you’re going to have a dish of soup. Oh, he says, fill this up. I says, that’s what call the Slovak like appetizer. Dish of soup. And I still doing it here. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Good. Well, so, let’s see. So you were like your mother’s helper. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: And after you stopped school you were really cooking for the whole family? SKAPIK: Well, oh, yes. When I come home, well, school was morning and afternoon, and about three o’clock from, come from school. Then I start to do my cooking. Peel the beans and start to cook the beans, because that (unintelligible) and all that, and make these blintzes or whatever. And when they come home they never know what they are going to eat. (she laughs) I... LEVINE: So what did you do for fun? What did you do when you lived there? What was enjoyable? What... SKAPIK: Well, they, like my sister, she likes dancing. I never did like dancing. Now. I was dancing, but I stop when I come here, because my, or when I was younger I, I liked to sing and much dancing. I went to hear music, listen to music, but I never cared for dance, unless somebody coax me into it so I went. But I could dance, but I never cared for it. But my sister, she was crazy about, about the dancing. So that was the entertain, and once a week, once a week on a Sunday afternoon. That’s all. LEVINE: Dancing? SKAPIK: Dancing. LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: That’s all. LEVINE: And what kind of music? SKAPIK: Well, accordion. And once in a while we have a gypsies playing the violin, and cymbal. That’s it. Once in a while when was some kind of a special music. But accordion. LEVINE: Tell me about the gypsies. Were they, did they, they didn’t live in the town. They were passing through? SKAPIK: Well, no. The end of the town, oh, well, about half a mile, there was their special houses. LEVINE: Oh. What were their houses like? SKAPIK: Well, it was sim, similar as, as, as us, only they were neglected. They were, they were nice house, because they got wood piled over there, pile of wood over here, they, we have, our wood was just nice and pile and all that. So. But they live altogether different. Only half a mile from, from our, the rest of the people, but they live altogether. All, and what, what they usually eat, anything that dies from the sickness, like chickens or pigs and all that, we give it to them. And they know how to cook it. They bury it in the ground first. They never got sick. We, we never, never, even the chicken, and big pig was sick, (unintelligible) we throw them out, cover them on the dirt, on the field. But give them to the gypsy. They know how to cook it, and they never get sick. Never got sick. Because they kind of bury them, but they (unintelligible) what they put in the ground, they wouldn’t let any, any outsiders to see that. And then they cook it. They have to be, be in the ground some, some, buried. And they never got sick. LEVINE: Did the gypsies go to school, too? SKAPIK: One girl in the whole town went to school with me. One girl. That’s the one (unintelligible) So they don’t care if they learn read or write or what they were about. LEVINE: Did people, did people look down on the gypsies? SKAPIK: No. No. LEVINE: Were the gypsies considered... SKAPIK: No. They treat them good. LEVINE: They did. SKAPIK: They treat, oh, yes. Yeah. And, of course, like when we have something left over or what, when our pig died or something, we just tell it to, give it to them. They’ll, they’ll eat it. Yeah. So we, we were good to them. Because they never work. They never work. They live... LEVINE: They make music. They play music. SKAPIK: Well, that’s only, that’s only manfolks [sic]. That’s only manfolks. But the women, they only, (unintelligible) like a pig get sick, a chicken get sick or something, they give it to them, and that’s, that’s what they live on. So. LEVINE: Did you have a best friend? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yes. LEVINE: What... SKAPIK: I have... LEVINE: What was your friend’s name? SKAPIK: Oh, well, there were a lot of... LEVINE: You had a lot of them? SKAPIK: ...yeah. But especially one that I, I was always, I live on the end of the town, and she live about the middle of the town. So when we go, want to go to church together or go to school together, she always waits for me from the, her house. They have the little bench to sit on it. And it was, Mary, that was her name, that was my very best friend. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And would you do, besides going to the dances, were there any other things that you would, do you remember games you played, or anything you did for enjoyment... SKAPIK: Oh, like a hopscotch and things like that?... LEVINE: Yeah. SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yes. We, who, who, like my sister, she was crazy about dancing. She was always, went over there for a while, and it doesn’t interest me, because I wasn’t interested in it... LEVINE: How about singing? Did, did... SKAPIK: I like to sing, but that was in the church. (she laughs) LEVINE: Oh. Uh-huh. SKAPIK: Yeah, I had very good voice. And I, singing, you know, I was St. Petersburg (unintelligible) choir. (she laughs) LEVINE: Oh. SKAPIK: In my old age. LEVINE: Oh, how nice. So you, so you were singing in Slovak? Or you were singing in Hungarian? SKAPIK: Well, at that time it was Hungarian... LEVINE: Yeah. SKAPIK: ...because I could speak Hungarian. Yeah. I even can speak in, I had one girl, she was from Budapest. I can talk to her. LEVINE: Oh. SKAPIK: Yeah. But she lived another town, and I, oh, for two, three years forget some of the words. But I speak very good Hungarian. Yeah. So. LEVINE: So, how was it decided that you would come to America? SKAPIK: Well, it’s a (unintelligible) story. My aunt got here, well, my mother’s step sister. My mother had two, two, her father died, while she was, while she was growing up. But she died while he was in (unintelligible). So the grandmother got married second time, so there were two sisters. One sister had a very drunken husband. So she left him and come into this country, and left her daughter, about seven years old, with my mother. Take care of her until she makes enough money to send for her. So that what she did. And then, oh, well, my uncle was coming in this country, too. My brother, my mother’s brother. And my aunt from here heard that, that her brother is coming in here. So she write to my mother, if you please put Anna, tell Anna that Ignatius, if he could bring my daughter, because they have no passport, nothing. They travel at night time. And this young girl travel with him. They were about four or five men. Night time, they were, they were sleeping under the bridges and they (unintelligible) go, most of them, they were travelling, can see. LEVINE: You mean in order to get to the port? Is that where they were, they were travelling from your town... SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: ...to get to, to the port where you left? SKAPIK: To, from city, city, city, city, till my mother take these, and that she was about a few years old, she went with her Vienna. But she can’t go any further, because she would have to have a passport and that. So that girl go with us, about five or six men I think they were. They took her because father was her uncle. Brought her in this country. So, few years after she got here, her mother was a cook for people thirty-three years. So she can her with her. Send her... END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO SKAPIK: ...my mother got a card, a letter from my aunt. It said, Cecilia, you take care of my daughter when I left (unintelligible), I would like to bring one of your daughter in this country. So my mother start to talk to us, she ask my sister. She says, ‘Oh, no. I’m not going anywhere.’ No. LEVINE: Why didn’t she want to go? SKAPIK: She, well, she likes to work like on the farm, and wintertime she, just like the piece I got over there. Embroidery. Fancy embroidery from, from Vienna, Bratislava. She said, ‘I’m not going.’ Then my mother asked me, ‘Would you like to go to America?’ I says, ‘I don’t know.’ But that means for her, yes. Next day she was packing my little, like a, not wooden, basket. What do you call it? Make out of the branches. LEVINE: Straw? SKAPIK: Yeah. Wood. So, that’s what I come here. So my aunt brought me here. LEVINE: So, so what was in your basket? What did you take with you? SKAPIK: Oh, just, my clothes, like. Nothing like these, but European clothes. My skirts and aprons and blouses and all that. And babushka. I always have babushka on my head. (she laughs) LEVINE: Uh-huh. SKAPIK: So, that, that (unintelligible) when I come here, they give that to Salvation Army. (they laugh) LEVINE: Well, tell me, how did you feel about it. Once you realized that you were coming to America, what did you know about America? Did you have any idea? SKAPIK: Nothing. Nothing. (she jostles her mic) Read about it once in a while, or read my uncle or my aunt the letters, that’s all what, what is going on, it’s going on. So, that’s, that’s about all. LEVINE: Were you afraid? SKAPIK: I, afraid? I was crying most of the time, because I couldn’t know the language. And I know I have to make money, make money, pay my way come here. Because my aunt bought me the tickets here and I have to pay her. And then I was travelling about two weeks before I get on the ship. LEVINE: Where, now, you left your town, and where did you go? Were you travelling by yourself? SKAPIK: No. I travel, well, with another girl that was my friend. She was year older than I was. But the two of us travel, oh, practically, oh, half a day, because we have to see ten doctors before we get on the ship. And then we were leaving like a barracks. They take all our clothes, and give ourselves something like they give in a hospital. It was a, and they put them in a oven because there were a lot of lice there. So that take us about five, five days before we get to the ship. LEVINE: Now, when you left your town, how did you leave? Were you on a, on a, a wagon? SKAPIK: Train. Train. Train. We travel on a train. And we didn’t even have a train in our town. We had to travel about three quarters a mile, three, three, well, three, one, one hour to, to the other, other village where they have the train where they have the trains. And then from there change from... LEVINE: Well, did you walk to the train? SKAPIK: Yes. LEVINE: Yes. SKAPIK: Yes, we did. Yes, (unintelligible) wherever we got the paper, like from my aunt, they got all the (unintelligible) there, and we had to stay there ten days to get these, get these clothes cooked, (unintelligible) there was four or five doctors. And last one was American doctor. When he signed your papers, or tell you were to go, you were to go. And there’s lot of them, because they got lice and all that. And they wasn’t clean, so they have to stay there until they clean themselves, and got nice clothes, better clothes or something. So I was chosen because I had nice, clean hair. I never have lice, lice and all that. So I went to the ship. LEVINE: Uh-huh. And what was the name of the ship? SKAPIK: Mount Clinton. LEVINE: Do you remember what it looked like? Tell me about the ship. SKAPIK: Well, it was a, it was a nice ship, but what the ships are, later on, it was old fashioned. Old fashioned. Food wasn’t very, very, very. Most of them feed us with the frankfurters. That’s what I ate. (she laughs) And when I come here, what they gave us in a, in a New York first day? Frankfurters. (they laugh) LEVINE: Well, so, were you down in the bottom of the ship? SKAPIK: Yes. LEVINE: Were you in the steerage... SKAPIK: Yeah. Yeah. LEVINE: ...everybody was in a big space? SKAPIK: Yeah. And we had the double beds. I was on the bottom and that girl that travelled with me, she was on the, on the top. So believe it or not I just went to see it first time, that Ellis Island, last year. LEVINE: Oh. (Mrs. Skapik starts to get up) Wait, wait. Don’t forget you have the mic. SKAPIK: Oh, oh, oh, oh. LEVINE: When we finish. SKAPIK: I was going to show you that that’s in the picture over there that... LEVINE: Oh, I see. SKAPIK: Yeah. LEVINE: The Wall of Honor. SKAPIK: Oh, yeah. I forgot it... LEVINE: Yeah. Uh-huh. SKAPIK: ...to put these on there. LEVINE: Yeah. Well, well, tell me, what was it like aboard the ship? What was the trip like? SKAPIK: Well, it was, it was very nice, but when we got about middle of the ocean it was very rough. Very rough. It was September. So it was very cold. Yes. So, but, I was, I walk around, I was outside. I never got sick on the ship. I was on the ship for I think fourteen days. And that was very good. But, well, about, when we got in about middle, very rough, rough way, but I never got, never got sea, seasick. LEVINE: Uh-huh. What were the people doing for those fourteen days? SKAPIK: Well, which one, like me, walking around, walking around, going around, because there, there were a lot of (unintelligible) and some of them was just reading, and they bring any kind of Slovak books or whatever, whatever that (unintelligible) because, and sometimes they have some kind games. You want to play that, and sometime they are speaking to us about the, some, what they come to America, what, what we should learn and all that. So it was interesting. But it was long. Fourteen days. (she laughs) So. LEVINE: Yeah. Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yes. LEVINE: Did you know what it was when you saw... SKAPIK: Well, I see a picture already in the books and magazines and all that, but that’s the first time I see from the ship. Yeah. (she jostles her mic) So after that was very, very, very interesting when you see it so close to us. Yeah. LEVINE: Was, was everybody up on the deck? SKAPIK: Oh, yes. Yeah. We practically keel the ship over. They start to holler, ‘Don’t everybody go on one side of the ship of it.’ (she laughs) So, yeah. Well, it was, it was interesting to see it. LEVINE: And then what? And then you went to Ellis Island. SKAPIK: Ellis Island. LEVINE: And tell me how that impressed you. SKAPIK: Well, we got there, well, I got here on a later day. And so I said my very good, three, four miles or six miles from the ship, we stopped there, changed captains. captains. This is the captain around the ship over the water, ocean, here to get off. And this captain come from the, no, from the New York, and the ship comes through there. So, well, we just, we just changed it to, to way, and what was that you asked me? LEVINE: I was saying when you, what was your impression of Ellis Island? SKAPIK: Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yes. So that time we, ship out I don’t know, four miles or so, they let us, tell that sending whoever us, going to pick us up, Ellis Island, the telegram. So we did. But my aunt, what was, she had left her husband, so when she come in this country she had to go to work. She was a cook for thirty-three years to, to, to one family. So I send her a telegram, but she didn’t get it till late in the afternoon. Then somebody got it in the morning. So I have to wait till next day. I have to sleep there one night. LEVINE: And was your friend still there, too? SKAPIK: Yes. LEVINE:Yeah. SKAPIK:And her, because her aunt and my aunt, they were very good friends... LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:...so that they travel together like I with her. So her aunt came and, I mean, it was, I don’t even know, because I hadn’t seen my aunt for so many years. We were walking around and walking around and looking at us, and I, I tell her, ‘What is she looking at us like that funny?’ And that was her. (she laughs) And then my... LEVINE:Well, what did you think when she didn’t show up? SKAPIK:Well, they keep on telling me, just go to your cabin, like they have, everybody had it, well, not the cabin, we had beds. LEVINE:Beds. SKAPIK:Yes, beds. Go to your bed and somebody bring it tomorrow. So the next morning she was there and her aunt, too. So, she bring us to, they call it Plainfield in New Jersey. LEVINE:Oh, uh-huh. SKAPIK:Yeah. So that was, that was very, very (unintelligible) because I come through (unintelligible) my, my Czechoslovak costumes... LEVINE:Yeah. SKAPIK:...because I didn’t have any, any like, like this. LEVINE:What did, what did you wear? Tell me what it looked like, what you wore when you came to this country. SKAPIK:Well, too bad I can’t show it to you because I gave it too my granddaughter. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:I have beautiful costume. Beautiful. It was a, well, like a petticoat. Long. And my skirt was like a taffeta, and lace on the bottom. I can show you, too, sometime a picture of it. LEVINE:Okay. SKAPIK:I have that. And so, for two days I was walking around Plainfield, New Jersey with, with my costume. And everybody look, they says, ‘Oh, take a look.’ Well, hat’s all I had to wear. But then my aunt says, no, we’re going to take that off. For a week you’re going to wear that in here, and then we’re going to get you dresses. And so when, well, when I, they put me to work for two, I stayed with her two weeks. And then I, I quit because I was, they, people in, where is it, where the Kennedy’s have their camps. What they call it? LEVINE:In Cape Cod? SKAPIK:Yeah. She went there on vacation. That’s why she had the time to spend with me, buy my clothes and all that. And so, but, well, they find me a job. Well, that’s was the best thing because I couldn’t speak a word of English and all that. And well, their name is Mrs., Mr. and Mrs. Marchand [PH]. They have a milk business in Plainfield. And when she showed me her bedrooms and all that, I see a picture on her, on the dresser like one over there. (she indicates) I says, ‘Oh, I know that girl,’ on her dresser, and she’s the one after the World War One come to the Europe first time in many years. And my aunt sent me a ring with red ruby. And she was the one that brought my (unintelligible). I says, ‘That’s Katie, that’s Katie.’ And Mrs. Marchand says, ‘Do you know my Katie? Katie, Katie.’ LEVINE:Oh, my goodness. SKAPIK:Well, she was very good to me. And she had a daughter, thirty-one years old. And she was somebody, he was married, the daughter wasn’t married. Oh, she was a wonderful, wonderful girl. Also she taught me... LEVINE:English. SKAPIK:English. And, and so, she was short. And anytime she needs something and (unintelligible), she says, ‘Philomena, I need you because this thing is up there.’ (she laughs) LEVINE:Do you... SKAPIK:But... LEVINE:Do you remember when you were first here, when you were in Plainfield, do you remember anything that struck you as different in this country? Different from what you knew? SKAPIK:Oh, everything was different. Oh, my. Especially, well, my language was the worst, my, because I need the language. So she, she was telling me I know. Oh, what was best for me, my aunt, my sister-in-law come to iron every Tuesday to these people. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:So I wait for like angels was coming from the heaven. I, my, my, Christine, that was her name, (unintelligible) anything Mrs. Marchand want to tell me, she have to put it on the paper until Christine, she to me. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:So, and then, the girl, their daughter was named Helen. And I promised myself because she was very good to me. She was patient with me. Sometime if I get married, if I have a girl, I’m going to name her Helen. And I did. My daughter in New Jersey is name after this Helen. Oh, when I told her that, you should see what she give me as a baby, for the, for the, oh, my goodness gracious. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:And they were very good to me. Very good to me. All of them. All of them. Mrs. Marchand and Helen, (unintelligible) and Walter. That was the son. And he was married. He was about twenty-three years, whatever, and Helen was I think twenty-five years old. Well, she never got married while I was there. No, she had boyfriends, but she never got married. LEVINE:How did you meet your husband? SKAPIK:Well, after, when I went to work the first time, I had to go on a bus. And there were three girls we were meeting on a certain place, and they had to take a bus to go to, that was on a Sunday. And there were three boys and three girls or four girls. Each, each girl got a boyfriend. I didn’t have no boyfriend because I, I don’t know anybody. But they all got out. I was the last one because I went there the furthest. And they all got out, and one boy stays on the bus. And when they all got out he come to sit with me on the, on the bus. And when I, I says, Slovak, I says, ‘Where you going?’ ‘With you.’ I says, ‘With you? Ha Ha.’ I says, ‘I don’t want you to go with me,’ well, because I didn’t want a boyfriend. I says, well, anyway, and who was that boy? That girl I told you that come with my uncle, he was practically engaged to her, this boy, and he went with me. So all right, he brought me to the, to the door. Open the, I give him key, open in the door, and I slid right in, and I says good-bye. And from that he come to see me any, anytime, any, anywhere, come as often as, as he can. And so, a year after I married him. LEVINE:So he was from, was he from... SKAPIK:From Horne Oroshane [PH]. He come here with his mother. Yeah. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:So he did that. And then... LEVINE:Did you know him? You didn’t know him... SKAPIK:No, I just see, see my cousin, and I says that’s, she came with the uncle. She, well, she like to take the pictures. Oh, she got pict, picture from the Mantush [PH] here to the Mantush over there. And my uncle and my aunt, she’s always taking pictures. So I see him, pictures on the wall. Who’s the Mantush, who’s Mantush, that’s all. And that was my Mantush. Year after I married him. So that, that was that. That was that. And then my aunt, well, she was very good to me for a while. But my cousin, she never speak to me after that. Never speak to me. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:Because I thought they were going to get married. I was, I was wondering, asking Helen, how much is our caterer, and my sister-in-law, what kind of clothes would I need for a wedding. I thought my cousin going to get married. My mother (unintelligible) I marry. Well, a year after I married him, and so. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:Yeah. LEVINE:Do you know why he changed his mind about your cousin? (she laughs) SKAPIK:He liked me. LEVINE:He liked you. (she laughs) SKAPIK:It’s because he liked me. When my aunt, well, she didn’t bring to the place where she was working, I have a cousin in next town, Dunellen, so she brought there. She’s told me, she’s gets my band ready and all that. Her name was Tilly. Tilly says, ‘All right,’ she’s got a bed and I can sleep there for a while. So, so I stay there for two, three days. And the rest of time I stay with aunt until her, well, (unintelligible) two weeks they put me to work, but it’s, well, hard, hard work. Oh, what, what (unintelligible) he brought me books, one Slovak and one’s English. She says you study that. And believe it or not I did. Every evening when I come upstairs to supper I studied the book, one about, about English, read it there, what’s in the Slovak, then that, and that’s the way I learned. And in less than a year I speak very good English, because I couldn’t go to school. I wanted to go to night school, but I was too far. I would have to go on the bus, and like (unintelligible) seven o’clock, by the time I got through it was nine o’clock. I think the school start seven or eight o’clock, so I never got chance to go to school. LEVINE:Uh-huh. Did you speak Slovak with your husband, or did... SKAPIK:Oh, yeah. LEVINE:...you speak English? SKAPIK:Oh, yes. He was eight years old when he come into this country with his mother. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:His father was here, and his father brought a daughter here. So they were in the Plainfield, New Jersey. And then (unintelligible) so then brought their daughter, sister and my father, they send them tickets for mother and Mantush. So he was eight years old. LEVINE:Oh, so he learned English early. SKAPIK:Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. LEVINE:Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So then, how many children did you have? SKAPIK:Three. LEVINE:Three. SKAPIK:(she indicates her son) That’s the baby over there. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:Sixty-five years old. (they laugh) LEVINE:And you have Helen? SKAPIK:Beg pardon? LEVINE:You have Helen? The child, Helen. SKAPIK:Child, oh, yeah, yeah, well. LEVINE:So you have Matthew, Helen, and who else? SKAPIK:Irma. LEVINE:Irma. SKAPIK:Oh, she’s Irma, but she’s Helen. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:After that Helen that teach me that how speak English, I told you. Well, then, when she was baptized, by husband’s sister was there like a godmother by children. So her name was Irma. So, because my husband liked that, that was his sister, so we used to all call her Irma. So after his, Irma. And she’s, well, she signed her name Irma Helen Skapik. LEVINE:Ah. SKAPIK:But her, her name was Irma. LEVINE:Uh-huh. And you have one other daughter? SKAPIK:An oldest what brought me here. LEVINE:Oh. And what’s her name? Olga? SKAPIK:Olga. LEVINE:Olga. Uh-huh. SKAPIK:Yeah. Yeah. She bought this place for me. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:Yeah, she was the oldest one. Yeah, she’s sixty-nine. Well, she’s nineteen years older than I am, so. (she laughs) LEVINE:Well, tell me what you’re proud of that you’ve, that you’ve done in your lifetime. What makes you feel proud of what you’ve done? SKAPIK:Well, I, I don’t know. Just, well, I, I, work all my life, all my life. LEVINE:Were you cooking or were you... SKAPIK:Cooking. LEVINE:...house, housework, and... SKAPIK:Yeah, yeah. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:One thing, my husband didn’t work for what, eleven years or twelve years. So I was cooking for people. LEVINE:You mean during the Depression was this? SKAPIK:Yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. I was, sometime I work like three to, to, three jobs in one day. From eight o’clock to eleven o’clock, from eleven o’clock to three o’clock, from three o’clock to six o’clock, because he wasn’t working. It was Depression. (she jostles her mic) And so I have to feed the children, and buy the clothes to go to school and all that. And they know some of that, but I never, well, talk to them much about it. So, but I work very, very, very hard. Very hard. And those, those people, well, they were good to me, but I have to get my work done. So I got three jobs in one day. LEVINE:Wow. SKAPIK:That’s the way it, so, well, anyway when they got grown, oh, well, Olga was, well, eighteen years old, she got a job in a, where is that? It’s on the water. And she got the girl friend to rent a room with her, so she work there. So that was one less to feed. And Irma, well, she was with me. And then, oh, when I take her to Europe. I stayed there six months with her. We were there in July and we come back in February. And by going to Europe she find a boy ask her to dance on that ship (unintelligible) Mount Clinton. And then by that time we got off, well, he got off in Paris, because he went for business. His father had a factory (unintelligible) in Tampa. So he went for the father there. So by, by that time, you know, my dear Irma, very good. He used to take her to all the nice restaurants and all that. But, of course, that was, we stayed there three. So, but I thought that was all. But when Irma got with me to Orashane, I thought it’s going to be forgotten. But they corresponded back and forth, back and forth. So, and so, when we come back after six months, they start to go together and they got married. But not right away, about a year. About a year. Because she had to go to work. She, money for me and money for different place, because she live with me when my mother and my father were still living. But for six months. We went there in July and come back February. And ocean was, one, the worst thing, that captain had an article in the paper, that was the worst travelling for him thirty-four years, the ocean was so wild. But Irma was in her cabin, because she wasn’t sick, only it was rocking once a while. But I was walking around, walking around, and I never was sick on the ocean. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:So, well, anyway, when we got to Europe, who is waiting for Irma, her husband. So, ‘I thought we’re not going to see you anymore.’ He says, ‘I’m not going to see Irma anymore?’ Because he called her Irma, too, because, so, and a year after they got married. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:And she’s got the best husband in the world. She travel all over, all over world. They take me to, around the world three times, my son-in-law. LEVINE:Wonderful. SKAPIK:I say, use to tell him, I says, ‘Dick, you don’t owe me anything, because you’re, let Irma dance with you and all that.’ And he says, ‘No, no, I know, but I like you, Mom, and I like you.’ LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:And still, they’ve been married, I don’t know, thirty, thirty-eight, thirty-nine years. I have never had one day that never speak to me or I speak to him. They’re very good to me. And I going to see them in a couple months. They’re going come here. LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:So... LEVINE:Well, let me ask you this. Do you have any ways about you that you think that you keep, that, that you learned when you were growing up in Europe? Do you keep certain customs, or certain characteristics that you keep that are Czechoslovakian or Slovak? SKAPIK:What, what, what, I didn’t know how you... LEVINE:Uh, what, what I mean is you started out for your first seventeen years. SKAPIK:Yeah. LEVINE:Do you keep up any of those, I guess the cooking is one way... SKAPIK:Yeah. Yeah. LEVINE:...that you keep the old ways. SKAPIK:Yeah. Yeah. LEVINE:Is there anything else that you do that you can, that you... SKAPIK:No. No. I... LEVINE:...started doing in Czecho... SKAPIK:...I do the cooking all the time, and I, well, when I, when I come here, two years ago that I’m here, well, I was still cooking in a, in a club. Three, three, I belong to three clubs. I cook every one of them. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:I love cooking. I love cooking. And now my daughter says, ‘Ma, I’m going to give you somebody once a day.’ I says, ‘I don’t want anybody in my kitchen, because I want to do my cooking.’ LEVINE:Uh-huh. SKAPIK:(she jostles her mic) So (unintelligible) I do what they call, my Orashaski [PH] food and all that. (she laughs) But better than American. Because I like to do that. But I love cooking. I, I do. So, well... LEVINE:And you sing? You’ve been singing? SKAPIK:Oh, yes. I, I used to sing all these club. I used to belong to four, five different clubs. When I come here I join every one of them. And we went away, only the, when I move, well, because they were diff, different things what I used to sing, with the Hungarians, with the, with the Czechoslovak, with the, with the, the, the Bohemian. And so I, every, every club I was singing in every club, because I... LEVINE:Now, do you, do you, given that you grew, that you were born in Europe and you were there for seventeen years and then you came here, do you think that you are different because you started your life over again, you might as well say, in this country? Do you think that made a big difference? SKAPIK:Well, I, I, I like everything, only because I went through the hard stuff, hard, hard days once upon a time and all that. Especially, well, well, I did not changes places, I worked for ten years, seven years, six years for people. But I liked all of them, and I learned a lot of, a lot of, a lot of stuff, only because when you changed from one you have to learn their style of cooking and all that. But I, I had very hard times. But in here I’m lonely, because they, when I was (unintelligible) to the three dollars a day, three dollars a week to school, oh, to club. And here, these people don’t want to talk to you. And when I go to the club, well, I’ll go just there, took a swim, I’ll, I would like to have a meal, but all the meals are only in the, in the evening, and I don’t go out in the evening. So, it’s, it’s little bit lonely. A little bit lonely in here. LEVINE:Yeah. SKAPIK:This, this guy here, well, he come to see me once in a while. (she laughs) LEVINE:Well, you have your family... SKAPIK:Yeah. Yeah. So... LEVINE:...close by, so that’s... SKAPIK:Of course, (unintelligible) in New Jersey. She comes here twice a year, and my daughter, she’s here every day. LEVINE:Well, that’s nice. Okay, well, the tape is just about over. Is there anything else you’d like to say before we close? SKAPIK:Well, I don’t know. What will you... LEVINE:Are you glad you came to this country? SKAPIK:Oh, yes, I am. My mother, when I was there with my daughter, my mother wanted me to stay there, and, or leave my daughter there. I says, I’m not going to stay because I got two children in America and I’m not going to be away from them, and Irma, I says, well, now that, she wouldn’t stay. Especially when she find herself a nice boyfriend. Oh, then, she’s, (unintelligible) because she’s getting very good along with my mother. And she learned a lot of, a lot of Slovak. LEVINE:Oh. SKAPIK:Yeah. So, but, well, I have very nice, but I have hard times, too. LEVINE:Yeah. SKAPIK:Very hard times. LEVINE:Okay, well, this is Janet Levine. I’ve been speaking with Philomena Skapik.
