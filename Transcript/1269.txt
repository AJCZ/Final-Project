LEVINE: This is Janet Levine for the National Park Service, and I'm very happy to be here today, July 5, celebrating the July Fourth weekend with Mr. Harry Parker, who was born Aaron Paraszewski in Poland. He came to the United States from Poland in 1910 when he was about six years old. I want to say that I'm very happy that you were able to come today, and that we have a chance to hear your story. PARKER: Thank you very much, Dr. Janet Levine, and first of all I want to thank you for having me here. In fact, you were very nice with all the phone calls we made just to set this up, and I'm very happy that I have my family here, especially my niece and her husband, who made all this possible. She's the one who took care of everything. And, because you're a little early, and, of course, I saw her name on the wall, on the wall here, and it's very good. In fact, I'm enjoying everything. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: Good. PARKER: Thanks to Janice. LEVINE: Well, maybe we could break precedent a little and you can just tell the little story about how you happened to come to be interviewed. PARKER: Uh, oh, yes. I think I was here about, we were here about two months ago, and I filled out a form, I filled out a form, and I guess they liked something I wrote, because a few weeks after that I received a letter, and the heading on the envelope was the Department of the Interior. I says, "Wow! I'm a big guy here. This comes from Washington." And I got this letter asking me if I would be interested in this Oral History Project, and I certainly was, and I answered that letter, and we tried to set up a date, an appointment. And I finally got in touch with Janet and, well, after about a dozen calls here and there and so forth, we were finally able to make it on this day. I have to remember that, I'd better remember it, because my anniversary is tomorrow. ( they laugh ) And, uh . . . LEVINE: How many years are you married? PARKER: Huh? LEVINE: How many years are you married? PARKER: Well, I think it will be thirty years tomorrow. Of course, I always sent my wife a, it doesn't seem a day over eighty-six or something like that there, see. ( he laughs ) She wants to throw something at me. But, if I may say so, I'm very happily married. She's a wonderful woman, and so she isn't here right now because, with the heat and the crowd and the holidays, it would be a little tough for her. LEVINE: Well, she'll get to hear the tape anyway. Well, let's start at the beginning. Tell me your birth date. PARKER: My birth date is April 18, 1904. LEVINE: And where in Poland were you born? PARKER: I was born in a little town which is outside of Warsaw. The name of it was Chopomova. That's the way we always pronounced it. And the C-H, as you know, is "ha" in some languages. It's spelled C-H-O-P-O-M-O-V-A. I hope that's the right spelling, because every time I would write a letter to certain people like my cousin, I would sign it "Harry from good old Chopomova." So I got it. LEVINE: Do you remember Chopomova at all? PARKER: Very, very little. I do remember, as I said, it's a suburb of Warsaw, and I used to have a fascination for the sun. For some (?). I remember crawling outside, and I would just lie down and just look at the sun, until they ran out to grab me. And I was lucky it didn't affect my eyes at all. But it was one of those things that I do remember that. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Do you remember the house you lived in at all? PARKER: No, that's something I, it was a small house. I remember because there was about two or three youngsters. We were in the bed, my brother and I, and it really was a small house. That I can remember. Because, however, we were comfortable. We were (?). LEVINE: And who was, who were your family members when you were in Poland? PARKER: Well, we lived with, of course, my mother passed away when I was maybe two, two years old. And after that my father came here. My father came to America first, and after a year or so he brought us over. We came over. I lived with my grandparents. I remember my grandfather. LEVINE: What do you remember about him? What do you remember? PARKER: Well, my grandfather was a very religious man, see. And maybe he liked the way I, on the (?) speaking my religion, he taught me very much about our religion and so forth. He was like an elder statesman in that little town. And he always lived up to. LEVINE: Can you remember him, what he looked like, and how he spoke to you? PARKER: I'm very sorry about that. Of course, we have his picture, and I can, through that picture I can see how he looked. He was my father's father, you know. LEVINE: What was your mother's name and her maiden name? PARKER: Her maiden name, I cannot remember, but her first name is Frances. My niece is . . . LEVINE: Named after her. PARKER: Named after her, yeah. LEVINE: And your father's name, first name? PARKER: Joseph. LEVINE: Joseph. PARKER: And what did your father do for work in Poland? LEVINE: He was a shoemaker, yeah. In those years they understand they were taught either to be a shoemaker or a tailor, as far as I can remember that, yeah. He was a very good shoemaker. ( he laughs ) I used to take care of him. I have a habit of walking, when I walk my shoes always, my heels always one side, and I remember he used to fix them every two weeks and say, "If you were to walk straight." Little things like that, I remember very well. He was a wonderful man and grandfather. As we spoke about grandparents, you know, and how we always looked up to grandparents, and I guess I was that way with my grandfather. LEVINE: Now, was your grandfather a shoemaker as well as your father? PARKER: That I really don't know. I never know what his occupation was as a young man. LEVINE: But he was religious. Do you remember any religious celebrations or any kind of observances when you were in Poland? PARKER: Well, I knew our Sabbath, you know, we started on Friday nights, see. And then I remember that everything would be, you know, always sort of set on hold and so forth. Very vaguely, very vaguely, because it was something that was very hard for me to remember all these years, see, especially when I was a youngster, you know. LEVINE: How about your brothers and sisters? How many did you have? PARKER: I had one brother, and then two sisters. LEVINE: And where did you fall in the line of children? Were you at the oldest end, or . . . PARKER: No, no, I was the youngest. LEVINE: You were the baby. PARKER: I was the baby, yeah. My sister Annie, she was the oldest. She was about seven years old, seven or eight years older than I, and we were sort of two years apart, see. LEVINE: And what were you like . . . PARKER: My other sister's name was Rose. Really two wonderful sisters. The most wonderful sisters anybody could have. LEVINE: Do you remember any experiences with your sisters, like when you think about them in your childhood times? PARKER: Oh, yeah, sure. I remember when I was going to school and, at that time my sister Annie was working, see. See, at that time we lived in Boston, and at fourteen years, when a youngster was fourteen years old, they could quit school and allowed to go to work, providing they had two years of night school, two years, until they were sixteen. And, of course, we weren't very financially secure and so forth, and all of us, when we were fourteen, we stopped school and started to work. And I do remember, when my sister was working and she used to get paid Friday nights. She worked in a stocking factory. And I used to wait for her to come home, and she would give me six cents. And, at that time, we'd go to the movies. Friday night they would have those serials, like The Perils of Pauline and stuff, and those, and we couldn't wait till Friday night to see the next episode. And here I had a nickel, I think, a nickel and a penny for, not jelly donuts . . . LEVINE: Jelly beans? PARKER: Jelly beans, yes, yeah. And I even remember at certain times the admission was two for five. That is, you could have two admissions for a nickel, see. And we had some pretty smart kids there, and they would say, "I've got two cents, who's got three? I've got two cents, who's got three?" I remember those things very well. LEVINE: Uh-huh. Well, let's, we kind of skipped ahead then. Let's go back to Poland. Your father left when you were about five years old. PARKER: Yeah, or earlier, because I don't remember when he left. LEVINE: You didn't remember your father in Poland at all then? PARKER: In Poland I really don't, no. I really didn't. LEVINE: So are there any other memories that you have of Poland before you left for the United States? PARKER: No. Well, I could remember that at times, at certain times, I don't know where we went, but we went to Warsaw then, yes, we went to Warsaw. It was about an hour-and-a-half ride or something. And I remember as a youngster my father would take my brother and I there, see. LEVINE: What would you go to Warsaw for? PARKER: That's something I really don't know. Maybe it was the examination for, in the hospital or something, or to a doctor. But honestly I don't know. But I do remember getting in a train and sitting, they didn't have no, it was like sitting in the steerage. We were sitting in back there, see, and trying to sit down someplace. LEVINE: Uh-huh. I see. PARKER: On the train. It was on the train, of course. LEVINE: Uh-huh. So until you came to the United States the furthest you'd been would be to Warsaw by train from . . . PARKER: Yes, yes. LEVINE: Right. PARKER: I mean, as far as going to other places, other cities, no. Outside of Warsaw, no. LEVINE: Okay. Now, how did you, who did you come to the United States with? PARKER: I came with a cousin, and my two sisters and my brother. There was four, five of us, yeah. And my father met us right here. LEVINE: Okay. Well, how did, did your father send money? How did you get the money for you and your cousin and brothers and sisters? PARKER: Oh, I guess he sent that, at that time they had quotas. I think every country had a quota, especially Poland, and so many could come. And I think we probably waited a couple of years, that I really, I didn't ask about that from the family. And, oh, he sent us tickets, of course. LEVINE: Oh, he did. PARKER: Yeah. LEVINE: And do you remember the name of the ship? PARKER: Yes. That I, it was the Kroonland. That's something I was able to check up on, and I found it was the Kroonland, spelled with a K. With a K, K-R-O-N-L-A-N- D [sic]. And I think I read about it. Much later it became a troop ship, probably (?), I guess. LEVINE: Do you remember leaving your house, or leaving your town? PARKER: That was something, that I cannot, no. I cannot remember. LEVINE: Do you remember traveling to the ship, the Kroonland? PARKER: Uh, I know we traveled. We traveled from one country to another, I think. Traveling was (?). But we were, I don't know, but I think we took the, I think it was in Belgium, but it could have been Antwerp or something. It wasn't in Poland. That I'm pretty sure. LEVINE: So you probably traveled to Antwerp. PARKER: I think it was Antwerp. LEVINE: And then you boarded the ship. PARKER: We boarded the ship there, yeah. LEVINE: Do you remember anything about that voyage? PARKER: Oh, I recall a fire that we had. At the time I didn't know it was a fire, and I found out later because I have a, I have a slight memory of many people. We were on deck, and they were all falling down and on their knees praying, see. Of course, I just looked around. I really didn't know that it was a fire, and I imagine there was a certain kind of anxiety. There wasn't a panic, as far as I remember, because nobody pushed me here or there or so forth. And I guess the prayers worked because nothing happened, to my knowledge. Although I did get seasick. LEVINE: Did you, were you down in the hold of the ship? Were you in what they call steerage? PARKER: Steerage, I think we were, yes. LEVINE: Do you . . . PARKER: That was about the lowest grade, I think. LEVINE: That was, yeah. That was where everybody was in one space. PARKER: That's right. LEVINE: Do you remember anything about the accommodations, the food, anything like that? PARKER: Well, as far as I know the food wasn't bad, because I wasn't very hungry, you know, at times. As I said, I got seasick, which of course is a few days we didn't (?). And yet it didn't make much matter. LEVINE: Now, your cousin was older than you and your sisters and brothers. PARKER: Yes. LEVINE: So she was kind of looking after you and taking care of you on this trip? PARKER: Yes, sure. We finally . . . LEVINE: Okay. So do you remember the ship coming into New York Harbor? PARKER: No, I do not remember that. I don't remember the ship coming in. Of course, I do remember, though, that my father was there because my cousin, of course, being older, she knew my father and, I guess, my sister Annie, who was the eldest, and probably Rose also, because they ran to him, you know, and embraced and so forth. And he took a look at me and says, "Is that the young one?" ( he laughs ) LEVINE: Do you remember how you felt seeing your father? PARKER: I was a little bit scared, you know, because, see, my father was a, he was a, kind of a strict man, see. You know, I mean, strict, I mean, as far as children were concerned, see, we had to, well, we had to be good kids, and we certainly were, see, and I was afraid, probably, how he would react to me. But he was a wonderful father, though, a wonderful father, a good provider, and I have fond memories of him. LEVINE: So he met, he met you . . . PARKER: Yes, he met us there. LEVINE: Do you remember, is there anything about Ellis Island that you recall in, how long were you here? Do you know how long you had to stay here? PARKER: In Ellis Island? No, I really don't. I don't think we had to stay too long because somehow I imagine they check up who's going to sponsor us, or taking care of us. And, of course, when my father was here, then that was it, because I do remember going to my aunt's house, my mother's sister, who at that time lived in Brooklyn. LEVINE: So you left Ellis Island. PARKER: We must have, yeah. LEVINE: And you went to Brooklyn. Do you remember anything about that, about your aunt's place, about your first few days in America, what struck you, or anything like that? PARKER: No, I really couldn't. I mean, as far as incidents and so forth, I couldn't remember. LEVINE: Okay. So then what happened? After you . . . PARKER: After we came to Boston. We took the boat, that I remember. We took the boat, the Boston boat, at that time, from New York, it went straight, was it went straight to Boston or not, but I know that the Boston boats from New York, we had to change in Providence, Rhode Island, and then take the train from Providence to Boston. We probably did at that time. LEVINE: And what did you do when you got to Boston? PARKER: Well, the first thing, my father had an apartment for us. We lived in the South End of Boston. And, of course, school was the first thing. We went to school right away. LEVINE: Do you remember any incidents learning English? PARKER: Well, of course, at first I mis-pronounced a lot of words, you know, see, but I learned English pretty good, fairly well. We couldn't, funny thing about those years, we did not go to the same school. The children did not go to the same school all the time. My two sisters went to an all-girls school, which was quite a way from where we lived. I think they call it The Franklin School. My brother went to a school that was called Abraham Lincoln School. I can't remember whether that was co-ed or not, and I went to a school, Quincy School, named after John Quincy Adams, who had, I think he was the fourth president of the United States, see. Named after him, and that was an all-boys school. LEVINE: So you had never been in school? You had not been to school before you came to Boston? PARKER: No, no. LEVINE: And did your sisters and brothers ever talk about school, and the difference between school in Poland and school in Boston? PARKER: Well, the only thing, I know that my sister Annie, she went to school in, I imagine it was in Warsaw, or maybe in the town there, see. And she could speak, she learned a little English there, as far as I can remember, because she was very quick in taking it up, you know, when we came to this country. LEVINE: Do you know how you learned English, what was really helpful to you in learning to speak English? PARKER: It was in school. It was just in school. There was no special school that I remember, when we learned English. Just being in school, and the teacher talking to us, and trying to answer, and so forth. It seemed to, it just came natural to us. LEVINE: Were there a lot of other immigrant children in your class? PARKER: I don't think so. No, see, very few immigrants would come to Boston in those years, see. They would probably stay in New York, or maybe further west, see, but Boston, I really don't remember any immigrants there. LEVINE: Okay. Well, so, you stayed in school. Uh . . . PARKER: I stayed in school, I was fortunate. I was able to graduate what they call public school. That was eight grades, eight grades. And, before I was fourteen, see. And, you see, graduation was in June, and the following year would be my birthday, April, so from three or four months I went to a sort of high school until I was fourteen. Then, of course, I had to leave high school like my sisters and my brother did, and I got a job as an errand boy, I guess, as an errand boy in a printing place. LEVINE: And then you had to go to night school? PARKER: I went to night school for two years. I think it was about two nights a week. And, though it wasn't bad, but it was a little bit different than high school, see, which, of course, we didn't have a chance to go to. LEVINE: What was the night school like? Do you remember it? PARKER: Well, of course, you see, it was at night, and I don't think they had a real teacher. Maybe, at that time, they could have had a substitute teacher, see. And it wasn't something that you could really learn a lot, let's put it that way, see. LEVINE: So you were, you took your first job as an errand boy, and how about your sisters and brother? What were they doing when they stopped school at fourteen? PARKER: Well, my brother, I think my brother came to New York. When he was fourteen he came to New York, and he learned a very nice trade through my, uh, as I said, my aunt lived here, see. And her son-in-law was in the, the business they had, it was part of a, it was part of a suit and clothes, where they had, embroidery, see. He was in that trade. Embroidery was very good in those years, and my brother became a very good operator, and I know he stayed in New York and he got married here, and he made a fairly good living through embroidery. LEVINE: And how about your sisters? PARKER: Oh, my sisters, one worked in, my sister Annie worked in a (?) factory. LEVINE: What kind? PARKER: A (?), they called it, you know. It was one of the finest companies at that time in Boston, in New England, you could say, for that matter. And my sister Rose liked to work in a store, see, food stores, see, very well-known as working in a delicatessen stores. She liked that very much, in Boston, and so forth. And later on I came to New York. My brother lived here. LEVINE: What prompted you to come to New York? PARKER: Well, I can't remember whether I was out of a job or not. I think I'd come to New York anyway, see. You know, I would take a trip and so forth. One of my greatest, I was in the Army. LEVINE: What year was that? PARKER: That was around 19, right after World War One, 1919. 1919, 1920. I was sent to Camp Upton in New York State, and from there we went to Fort Salem, Oklahoma. I remember the name of my outfit. It was Batter E, Field, First Field Artillery, stationed at Fort Salem, Oklahoma. LEVINE: Were you stationed there the entire time? PARKER: Well, at one time we were all set to go to the Philippines. I think they had some trouble there at that time. But that wore off, and that was straightened out. And I spent the rest of the time at Fort Salem. LEVINE: Huh. There's one thing that we neglected to discuss. Your cousin, who was older, then, your mother had died, your father then married that cousin. PARKER: Yes. LEVINE: Once you arrived here. Now, tell me about that. Was that a typical kind of, uh, family . . . PARKER: Well, oh, yes. LEVINE: . . . arrangement? PARKER: Well, I can't remember whether it was a family arrangement that I can't remember, see. But I guess my father knew her when we were in the old country, in Poland, and when she came over, I guess, to get married, and that's what it was. LEVINE: Yeah. I seems . . . PARKER: I can't remember any courtship or something like that. That I cannot. LEVINE: It seems very often we hear about cousins marrying, or people marrying in the same family. PARKER: Oh, yes, yeah. It's prevalent, as far as I know, in many countries, the countries that I know of, and so forth, intermarriage, and so forth. Whether you can marry cousins, or even nieces, or something like that, see. LEVINE: Well, do you think that your cousin came expecting to marry your father? PARKER: It's possible, it's possible, yeah, yeah. LEVINE: Okay. Well, I think we'll pause here, because we need to change the tape to the other side, and then we'll continue. PARKER: Sure. END OF SIDE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO LEVINE: Okay. This is Side B now of my interview with Harry Parker, and we were talking about you coming to New York and joining the service. Now, how old were you then? PARKER: Well, I wasn't quite eighteen, but at that time, I guess, everything was all right. I was able to join the, uh, I was able to become a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, something I was very proud of. I think I had written that down. Yeah. LEVINE: Yeah. Okay. And then, when you came out of the service, what did you do? PARKER: When I came out of the service, I came back to Boston, I guess, and I worked there, that's what I remember very much. I worked there, I worked in Boston for a while in the printing line, in the printing line. Then I came back to New York and got a job in the printing line. And then, further on, in the late 1940's, I joined the post office. I worked in the post office. I retired from the post office thirty-one years later. And I thank the United States Post Office very much, because it was a steady job for all that time, I made a fairly good living, and when I retired they, the benefits were very, came in very handy. After I retired, about two or three months after that, I just couldn't just walk around doing nothing, and I took some kind of a test they had. They had a very, a very good employment agency on the Grace Building at Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street, and after they give you some instructions or lessons for about three hours or so, they ask you what you could do, and whatever you said you could do, you have to write on it. In fact, they had something, they had all kinds of machines there. If you said you were very good at a computer, at that time it was an adding machine or something, you could work on an adding machine. Well, anyway, I think I did a fairly good job, because a couple of months later I was asked if I wanted to work in a bank, and so forth, as a temporary employee, just temporary, because the regular fellow was out. I think he was a floor man at the time. I accepted that, and after a couple of weeks, it turned out I worked there about six weeks, and then they called me back a few weeks later as a temporary employee, and that was almost twenty years ago, and I'm still working for the same bank, which has a different name now. And I used to work part-time about three or four days a week. LEVINE: Is the bank near your home? PARKER: No, no, the bank is in Manhattan, on the East Side of Manhattan, midtown. And, of course, I live in Queens, but I get up pretty early, and I approach how I'm getting there. The transportation's pretty good at that time. In fact, the New York subway isn't bad. ( he laughs ) It's very nice, air conditioned and everything. LEVINE: Well, do you, I take it you like working at the bank? PARKER: Oh, yes, yes. It's a very fine bank. Can I give the name of the bank? It's, yeah, it's The Commercial Bank of New York. It used to be the American Savings Bank. But since the, the American Savings Bank was very good but, of course, they ran into difficulties, like so many banks in the last few years, an four of our branches were taken over by The Commercial Bank of New York. It's The Commercial Bank of New York where I work now. Give the address, it's a branch on 79th Street and Second Avenue. And they treat us very well there, and I'm very happy to be there. LEVINE: Good. Tell me about your wife. How did you meet your wife? PARKER: Well, I think, let's see. When I worked in the post office I was introduced to her through one of the fellows I worked with, see. And, uh, I guess that's how it started, and we went out together. LEVINE: Do you remember what it was that you liked about her? PARKER: Well, she was sort of small. She was very cute, very petite, like. And, of course, she was a brunette at that time, and she could dance very well. And I became a good dancer dancing with her. And any time we had a wedding, or some kind of an affair, see, we'd go out to dance and we really made a good showing. ( they laugh ) LEVINE: Do you have children? PARKER: Uh, no, no. I haven't got any children. But . . . LEVINE: What is it . . . Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. PARKER: Yeah. But my wife has, as I mentioned before, she had a son who has four sons and a daughter, and they have grandchildren. So my wife is a great, great grandmother. She'll probably be a great-great-great- grandmother pretty soon. LEVINE: What is your wife's name? PARKER: Uh, Pearl. My wife's name is Pearl. LEVINE: What was her maiden name? PARKER: Uh, Puder. Yeah, Puder, P-U-D-E-R. LEVINE: Well, what are you proudest of? When you think back over your life, what makes you feel very proud? PARKER: I'm very proud of my family. I'm very proud of my family. I had a very nice family. My brothers, my sisters. I miss them very much, especially my sisters, and my brother. Now I have a very nice family, continuing, you know. I have four lovely nieces from my two sisters, Frances, of course, is at least number one. Her sister Ruthie is niece number two, and Jamie is niece number three. Now, my sister Rose also has a very fine daughter, her name is Rita, and she has three daughters. And they're very lovely, they're very nice. So, between both sides of the family and, of course, Frances has children, her son Mark, and there's another son, Jerry. Jerry's married to a very fine girl, Dawn. And Ruthie now is a grandmother. And she has two, three children, two very lovely girls and a boy, and they have children, so that makes her a grandmother, of course. And Jeanie, Jeanie has, oh, my goodness, she has two sons, two sons and a daughter. One of the sons is married and lives in Texas. We go to Texas often, because that's where Pearl's family is, and we try to get together many times. LEVINE: I see. PARKER: So I really have a very nice family. LEVINE: Good. PARKER: Very nice. I'm very, very proud of them. LEVINE: When you think about starting your life in Poland and coming here as a young child and living out the rest of your life here, do you think there's any influence on you that that early time in Poland has had? In other words, do you think having started out in Poland has affected you life in any way? PARKER: No. I don't think it did. As I mentioned before, see, it's hard to remember my life in Poland, but I know one thing, we had a tough life. Things weren't easy for my father, because when he married he had other children, you know, and quite a family, and we had to work hard, and so forth. And I'm thankful that we all made it, and we didn't have to go to anybody, and each one took care of themselves and never harassed anyone else. If we knew somebody was in, needed some help, we were the ones to ask them if they needed help, see? No, our family has been wonderful. And my life, well, whether it had to do with being in Poland, I don't know, but I guess I was brought up pretty well. LEVINE: Do you remember any of the values that your mother or father, or your father or your cousin, wanted to instill in you? Do you remember any of the . . . PARKER: Well, my father used to tell me that Harriet would say, "If you can't talk good about anyone, don't say nothing." I always remember that. And he would also say, "Never argue on politics or religion." You could discuss it, but don't get into arguments and so forth, because it's something that can never be solved. He was the best. I remember very well. And in school, of course, I had wonderful teachers, and they really had a great influence on certain things which helped me, helped me try and be a good citizen, I'd say, and a good person. LEVINE: Can you remember any of those teachers particularly? PARKER: Oh, yes. I do remember them very well. Yeah. I remember one teacher, it was in the seventh grade. She was very, very strict. In fact, us boys, you know, before the bell would ring in school to go to the class, we would kid around, you know, play games, or have a few fights or so forth, we'd get our hands dirty and our face dirty and so forth. And when we came in, the teacher would be at the door, and we'd have to show our hands, and she would look at our neck, and so forth. And if they weren't clean or anything, we would have to go and wash them, and wash them, and then come in. And then we would be late, of course, a few minutes, and we would have to stay after school because of that. But she was wonderful. She was fair and everything. And she taught us, she taught me, anyway, a whole lot. To be on time, and I always tried to be clean, and so forth. It was very nice, very nice. LEVINE: Okay. Well, is there anything else? Well, how about this phase of your life, what we could call old age? What is this part of your life like for you? PARKER: Well, I try to keep busy, because I just can't stick around or stay in a park too long. That's why I'm glad I'm working, I don't know how much longer I'm working, because it's getting pretty tough at this stage of the game, you know, and it's probably, I'm sure it will be my last year of work. LEVINE: At eighty-nine, that's pretty good. ( she laughs ) PARKER: I figure I can take a little easy for a while, and sleep a little late, like I did the last three holidays. And I don't know whether I mentioned it over here before, but I, this interview, by the way, Janet, makes me feel very, very, very good. It makes me feel that all of a sudden I'm somebody, see. Thanks to my niece and her husband, who made all this possible. She was the one that got in touch with the, with Ellis Island. And, of course, we have our family names on the honor roll, is it? LEVINE: The Wall of Honor. PARKER: On the Wall of Honor, and that's very something. And, of course, when we were here a couple of months ago we saw that, before we saw the film about the immigrants, and when the instructor or the guy there asked us, she was a very fine lady, by the way, and asked, "Is there's anyone here that passed through these, that passed through here at one time or another?" I guess I was the only one that raised the hand, and I became a sort of celebrity because . . . ( he laughs ) I got, first of all, I got a knockout. I got a hand from the crowd in the auditorium. And going out this group of girls stopped me and looked at me and said, "I always wanted to meet an immigrant." See, and she looked at me like I was something out of this world, and I really felt good, because, well, it didn't exactly (?), but I'd rather give it. So, and again, Dr. Janet, I appreciate all this, and I want to thank you very much for having me here. LEVINE: Well, this has been a rare pleasure for me, and maybe this is a good place to stop. I think you've waxed eloquent, and I want to thank you very much for being here. I have been speaking with Harry Parker who came from Poland at six years of age in 1910. And today is July 5th, 1993, and we are here at Ellis Island in the studio, and I am signing off.
