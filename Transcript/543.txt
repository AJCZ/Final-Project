LEVINE: Today is November 19th, 1995 and I am here in…at the home of Sonja [Safola], who came from Russia in 1921 when she was eleven years old. Today…today Mrs. Safola is eighty-five years of age, and this is Janet Levine for the National Parks Service, and we’ll begin here. If you would say for the tape please your birthdate and where you were born in Russia.

GABRINER: I was born January 25th, 1910 you know in a small town…near the Polish border. The name of the town was Kletsk. 

LEVINE: And did you remain living in Kletsk until you were eleven years old and left for the United States?

GABRINER: Yes. Yes. 

LEVINE: Okay so now speaking about life in Kletsk. How about first giving your father’s and mother’s names. 

GABRINER: Yes. My father’s name was David Gabriner and my mother’s name was Francis. 

LEVINE: Do you remember your mother’s maiden name? 

GABRINER: Yes. My mother’s maiden name was Ciok, C-I-O-K. 

LEVINE: Okay and would you spell Gabriner for the tape?

GABRINER: G-A-B-R-I-N-E-R.

LEVINE: And did you have grandparents who living near you in Kletsk? 

GABRINER: I had grandparents and at the time that we left Kletsk, they were living with us because they had…they had lived there [Recording skips at 0:01:44] My maternal grandfather was a blacksmith, and they lived in a village, which was like one street, and they…and he was the blacksmith for that village. But the house and the blacksmith shop did not belong to him, it belonged to the people who owned the village, or the head of the village, and at that time, right after the Russian Revolution, they were sent…they were relieved of their duties there, and they were sent out. They were expelled actually and my grandfather and his family came to Kletsk and they lived with my mother. [Phone rings interrupting conversation at 0:02:40] 

LEVINE: Okay we’re pausing here. 

LEVINE: Okay we’re resuming here after a telephone call. You were saying…something about your grandfather coming to live with you. Do you remember visiting that little village where… 

GABRINER: Yes I do. 

LEVINE: What…what do you remember? Is there anything else you could say about that village? 

GABRINER: When I visited there, I was very young but I remember the house. It was very nice. It was a sort of a farmhouse, and my grandparents had a very large family. They had five daughters and the daughters were all very creative, and they crocheted and sewed and everything in the house reflected their touch. They were great homemakers and cooks and they had a lovely little garden out in the back with vegetables and flowers; I remember that, and I remember there was one street, and one end was the…was the village inn. At the other end was the priest house, and my mother knew everybody in town, including the children of the priest. The Russian priests are allowed to marry I think; they are Russian orthodox, and she even played with the children of the priests, and had a crush on one of them—one of the men, she told me. 

LEVINE: Hmm. Now was this typical of a small village…in that area that it would have one street and probably what about twenty families? 

GABRINER: Yes, yes, and they farmed the land for the…well I don’t know what you would call them. In Russian I think it’s called a [poritz], which are I think he probably had a grant from the government—so much land that he could till—and he employed all the peasants who lived there in the little village 

LEVINE: To till the land?

GABRINER: To till the land. 

LEVINE: And then he, himself worked as a blacksmith? 

GABRINER: My grandfather worked as a blacksmith and all his sons, five sons, were also blacksmiths. That’s the way it was; you were what your father was. My father was a shoemaker and so was his father. 

LEVINE: Now do you remember anything particular about your grandfather or your grandmother—your maternal grandfather or grandmother?

GABRINER: I remember…I remember my grandfather reading the Bible I guess it was in the evening and he wanted to save kerosene because that was hard to get or expensive, and he would burn a very dry…I think you would call it a spell—its a piece of wood, and it would burn very slowly and he would hold that over the book, and he would be reading his portion for the evening. My grandmother wore a…she wore a kerchief all day on her head, and on Saturday she wore a wig. Her hair was grey but he wig was brown, I remember that, and she was short and stout, and was not very grandmotherly. I don’t ever remember her being overly affectionate or kindly. Once in a while she would give us a cookie, but other than that I don’t…I don’t seem to remember having any…having missed her when we left for some reason or another. 

LEVINE: Do you remember the disposition of your grandfather? 

GABRINER: Never talked very much; a very silent man; long gray beard. But I don’t think they were all that old because when we left, we left them in our house. What had happened to spur my father to come, to immigrate at the time was that they had built a new home and had borrowed money from various people in town to fray the expenses. I don’t think there was a bank, a formal bank. I think you borrowed money from private people and you gave them I.O.Us something like that. 

LEVINE: So your father had built a new house? 

GABRINER: Yes. 

LEVINE: Mm-hmm. 

GABRINER: We never lived it in because we couldn’t afford to. We rented it out because we owed all this money, and then they decided that he would go to America and work for a while—two years the most, and he’d send over all the money he earned, and she—my mother—would pay off the bills on the house. 

LEVINE: Was the plan was that then he would return at some point?

GABRINER: And the plan was that he would return, definitely. But the year was 1913 when my father left, and he left my mother with four children. The youngest of whom was in the cradle, and a year later of course war broke out, and from there on there was very little communication at times. Certainly no money coming through, and all during the war my mother did everything she could to make a living for herself and her four children and she did that by sewing and going out to the villages and buying things like butter or eggs and selling them in the city. And in that way she was able to sort of eke out a living. It was hard, but she did it. 

LEVINE: So she would go to a village not unlike the one that your grandfather and grandmother…

GABRINER: Yes. Mm-hmm.

LEVINE: …and bring it back to Kletsk. 

GABRINER: Yes they had a market day where all the villagers would come from around the area and bring their produce in, and she would go there and set up a little stand and sell whatever it was she had to sell. 

LEVINE: How about your grandparents on your father’s side. Did you know them at all? 

GABRINER: No they were…they died before we were born. I was named after my paternal grandmother. 

LEVINE: Sonja. 

GABRINER: So I didn’t…yeah so I didn’t know her. I didn’t know either one of them. My father was ten years older than my mother and had been married before. He was…he was a widower. He had been married to my mother’s cousin. 

LEVINE: Oh. 

GABRINER: And the house that they lived in—the little house in the back of the big house, this big new house—was inherited by my father from his first wife’s estate. 

LEVINE: Did you know anything about her—his first wife?

GABRINER: Well I knew that my…that my mother went to their wedding. My mother was thirteen years old when my father and her cousin were married, and never thinking that eventually this would be her husband. But she died. His wife died in childbirth, and he had had four children with his first wife, and none of them survived. I would ask them now and then what it was they died of, but he didn’t seem to know, said they all died of different things when they were infants. 

LEVINE: Was it that your mother’s cousin…did the fact that your father’s first wife was your mother’s cousin make it more likely that he would then marry her? 

GABRINER: Oh yes because when my grandfather would go into town for whatever reason he had to go into town, he would stay overnight at my father’s house because that was his niece at that time. And so when my father became a widower, he still would go and he would stay over, and one night he…he said to my father ‘you know I think you should come out for the weekend and be with us because you’re too lonely, and anyway I would like you to meet Francis’–my mother who was at that time eighteen years old and was the next in line to be married, and her younger sisters were sort of behind her, pushing because they wouldn’t get married until she got married. That’s the way it went. And so he went for the weekend, and my mother was…I think she was a little taken aback. My mother always said that he looked so old, and he had a beard, and he said about her that she was very pale and very thin, and her complexion was not all that great. They sort of ran each other down but he went out again for another weekend and he brought her a gift; it was a box of face powder. And I remember the box because one of my younger aunts used that powder on her face. It had swans on the cover and it was pink and blue some such thing, but and she when her father asked her if he liked him, she said well she sort of liked him, but she wished that he would cut off his beard. Well he didn’t comply completely but he did trim it quite a bit, and six months later I guess…well not six months…he had been a widower for sixth months when they got married, and she went into Kletsk to live with him. And I remember her telling me and my sister, I think, that she would like…she would like it if we did not marry widowers because he was still in mourning for his first wife, and she you know really had a rough time. She would wake up at night and find him crying and…but in no time at all she was pregnant, and he was ecstatic and very nervous because he had lost so many children; he was very anxious to have a family, and when my older sister was born and she was a big, healthy, thriving baby it kind of made up a lot for any other discrepancy. He adored her but she always tried to make us feel that she was hard to get and that he was the only one that was in love, but I did not believe her because she did tell me that he was very good looking, and he was. She was not considered to be a good-looking girl, but he was very handsome. 

LEVINE: So what was your oldest sister’s name? 

GABRINER: My oldest sister’s name was Rose. 

LEVINE: And the other children in the order of their birth? 

GABRINER: Rose, [Hai], Abe…well I was…Rose. Hai, Sonja, Abe, and then of course when we came here a year later, Matthew was born—the celebration baby. 

LEVINE: What…were you closest to anyone particular of your brothers and sisters?

GABRINER: [Coughs] I was…as children I was not close with my sister; I was close with my brother, my older brother whose name was Hai. I remember him taking me whenever he…a lot of times when he went like into the forest picking blueberries with his friends, he would take me along and take very good care of me because I was a very timid child, and he always was a big brother to me. And he always was a big brother to me. 

LEVINE: What was life like in Kletsk?

GABRINER: Well life was a little bit of everything. When my grandparents came to live with us, they had three children left at home who were not as yet married, an aunt and two uncles, and during the war the two younger uncles were in the army. One of them was taken prisoner on Germany and didn’t come home until after the war was over, and we didn’t know where he was or whether he was alive. But they both…they survived. Another uncle who was married and had a family, he had you know partitioned in the wall that he had built so that he wouldn’t be found and conscripted but eventually they found him but that was towards the end of the war and he wasn’t gone for very long. Schooling was not very good. I never had any formal…didn’t go to a formal school; my sister did and my brother I think. Well my brother went to Hebrew school, and my sister went to a school where my mother had to pay but I was taught by my sister or a neighbor or just a little bit. I learned to read and maybe do a little bit of addition but that’s about all I knew until I came here when I was eleven years old. 

LEVINE: What language did you speak at home?

GABRINER: Well I would say my mother tongue was Yiddish. But I spoke Russian and I read Russian. Shortly after we came here I was very anxious to be an American girl and I would not speak anything but English. For years I did not say a word in any other language, and I forgot all my Russian. I still remember a little bit of Yiddish because my parents spoke Yiddish. 

LEVINE: In this country too? 

GABRINER: Yes. Yes they did. 

LEVINE: Do your remember any ceremonies while you were still in Russia? 

GABRINER: Oh yes I do! I remember when my aunt got married. I remember the matchmaker coming to the house and talking to my grandparents and I loved my aunt. I thought she was the most beautiful creature in the world. I used to sit and watch her get dressed to go out, put on her powder and things, and wet her finger and do this to her eyebrows. So there would be…bite her lips and pinch her cheeks. 

LEVINE: And do you remember what the matchmaker…what transpired when the matchmaker was there? 

GABRINER: Yes the matchmaker would come in and describe this young man she had for her, and then my aunt would listen, and then by the description she would tell her yes she would like to meet him or no she wouldn’t like to meet him. And then when she finally met who she liked, my grandparents were not all that crazy about him. He was a rabid communist; this was before the revolution. He was very active in the party—in the revolution—but anyways she married him. 

LEVINE: So in other words, your aunt’s parents weren’t involved in the initial matching? 

GABRINER: Yes well they were there; all three were there and they would listen to what the matchmaker had to say. And they were married and the second one—the young man—he got married, that’s the youngest…yes I guess all three were married while we were still there. 

LEVINE: Do you remember anything that had to do with dowries? 

GABRINER: Well the youngest one I remember. The youngest one married a girl who was called a …everybody had a kind of instead of people knowing your last name, they knew some…they knew you by a description like Janet the shoemaker’s daughter or so-and-so the tailor’s son or the water carrier’s nephew. And this young woman was known as the [Russian word: 0:23:35] daughter. [Russian word] is a Russian expression meaning the childless couple’s daughter, which means that she was adopted, and her father was also a blacksmith like my uncle. And they…and he eventually married her and went to live there, and that was their home but the old people lived with them. But at their death, they were going to own the blacksmith’s shop in the house—that was theirs—so that was her dowry. 

LEVINE: I see and how about the wedding itself, do you remember any of those? 

GABRINER: Yes [Maya]. The wedding, the ceremony, were usually done outdoors—under the stars. 

LEVINE: Oh so it was at night? 

GABRINER: I remember them being at night. 
 
LEVINE: Mm-hmm. 

GABRINER: And then the reception or the…was in the house, and their was food and dancing and singing and sometimes their was music at weddings, and I always used to love to do the dancing. The dancing was great, and I was very much interested in their goings on. Whatever was happening in the family was of great interest to me. 

LEVINE: What…what other kinds of socializing did the families do at the time? 

GABRINER: Mostly the socializing was whatever the family could offer; there were…there were holidays and holidays were always a time of meeting the family, and eating together. The young people went for walks a lot. They walked and they went to weddings where they danced, but when they walked—they usually walked the girls walked together, and the boys walked together—but eventually they would meet someplace and talk together. They would get together that way. 

LEVINE: And were they…were most of the holidays religious occasions? 

GABRINER: Yes. There was…they were all religious occasions. All the Jewish holidays were religious occasions and a cause for celebration. 

LEVINE: Were there many Jewish people in your city or what was the mix like? 

GABRINER: I think they were mostly a Jewish people. There was a street that was called Pig’s Alley and that was…I know there were…there were other…there were non-Jews too because there was a church and there was a mosque so there must have been Muslims, but mostly it was a Jewish town. 

LEVINE: Did you ever celebrate birthdays or name days? Anything like that?

GABRINER: Well there was such a thing but we did not celebrate them; I don’t know why I guess because maybe we didn’t have enough money to buy…[Recording ends at 0:27:34].
