hopkins:	i forgot, i guess christmas and i remember so well my dad when he was over here he sent gifts over and they came well in the evening when my mother was over the neighbors. i say this so often to jim, when i was walking from my house around the corner to where my mother was. the snow was glistening, it’s like diamonds. i was just so happy because my dad had sent me a present and everybody a present.  mine was a sewing box. did i say to jim a lot now when we were here and look at see the snow i said, “that reminds me of the night i had to walk around the corner to get my mum with the snow as glistening.” keith:	so now let’s get, we’re getting now to the point of you mentioned that you played with your playmates and you had whole block of kids over there. hopkins:	yeah the whole block, yeah. keith:	what type of games did you play, what type of?

hopkins:	no, i don’t remember that. keith:	okay so you said your father came here first. hopkins:	yeah. keith:	what year did your father come over? hopkins:	1923. keith:	1923 and do you remember him first bringing up this idea about going to america? hopkins:	no, don’t remember just that when he was saying his friend jackie [inaudible 00:19:53] they’re going to america and i guess he talked to my mother about it. he decided he was going to come to america things were better. keith:	where did he come to? hopkins:	pittsburgh. keith:	why pittsburgh? hopkins:	that’s where his friends came. keith:	what were they doing in pittsburgh? hopkins:	i don’t know what jackie conley did. but he did come to see us since we moved to pittsburgh but i don’t remember. when you’re little you don’t pay that much attention what these men are doing. keith:	what was your father working as when he first came here? hopkins:	he worked in the run house of the rail road, it was hard work. that’s the only kind of work he could get i guess. then he didn’t stay there very long and then he got a job in the [inaudible 00:20:47] bank. well they called it the union trust bank downtown pittsburgh. then he just worked there and worked himself up till he was an electrician. he retired from there and he got a pretty good, but what was his pension i forget. but anyway it wasn’t much of a pension but i think i got more money because his salary was small on those days as depression. but they paid him more in retirement. i think it was 100 dollars or something he got. because nobody expected him to live to 94. but he came after my mum died then he came to live with us and he was very contended. he thought he was going to live forever. so he died at 94. keith:	well when you, so he came here first and then you waited a few years. hopkins:	2 years. keith:	2 years right. you mentioned tell me about what happened with your mom selling everything? hopkins:	well she sold everything then she went, as a job i think it was like a house keeper. so she cooked and we all the kids were there and she cooked for this family. then when my dad he kept sending money over for her to save for our fare over which she did. then she sold everything that was in the apartment and that’s how we moved.   keith:	what was your attitude about coming to the united states? hopkins:	i don’t think she was just like us i guess. i’m not sure how she really felt she never said much. i know she was awfully sick, sea sick on the boat. keith:	now when you got, did you take anything with you, what did you pack to bring here? hopkins:	i guess i think she had some blankets, she had some knick knack. keith:	like what knick knack? hopkins:	well i have one out in the kitchen it’s a little boy and girl playing here did that. i can’t really mostly remember. i think it was mostly clothing and blankets because she didn’t know what she was coming to. keith:	any family pictures or records? hopkins:	oh! yeah but my brother had. we had those big albums but my brother took them. i have pictures of my mum and dad on their wedding day. they got married in 1910 but i don’t know what i did with them. look in there jim, see if you can find them in there. keith:	okay so did you take anything special with you? hopkins:	i think i took, no i can’t remember. my sister had a doll that she was going to take but somebody told her, they told you all kind of things when you were leaving to come to america about what you could take and what you couldn’t take. so i guess we just took the bare necessities.     keith:	now did you have a medical examination before you left? hopkins:	well i don’t know but we had one in ellis island. keith:	now before you left did you see your grandparents at all, did anybody have goodbye party for you going? hopkins:	no, no, no maybe the neighbors came goodbye i don’t know. keith:	did you take any food with you? hopkins:	no not that i remember. keith:	so tell me what you remember about the trip? hopkins:	well i remember the cabin kind of remember the cabin. keith:	do you remember getting to the boat first? hopkins:	yeah well no. i don’t know whether we got to the boat, whether we went to london to get the boat i don’t remember that. i remember in scotland we used to walk down to i guess it was the clydebank river and see the people leaving.  so i’m pretty sure that we left from scotland but my brother he’s only 3 but he thinks we came from england because he made that we have one of those certificates from ellis island and he thought but unless he got just wanted to say that my dad came from london england. but i think we, i remember sort of leaving from scotland because i know we used to go down this place and we’d be waving to the people that were going to america. so then my mum and my sister got sick. they were seasick on the boat. keith:	what class accommodations did you have? hopkins:	3rd class. keith:	3rd class and did you have your own, explain to me how you slept or how it was arranged? hopkins:	it was like bunks, 4 bunks. it was a real small room. keith:	there was the 4 of you. hopkins:	yeah. keith:	your mother wasn’t escorted by anyone. hopkins:	no. keith:	so your mother was sick and your sister was sick and you and your brother were free. hopkins:	right we had a good time. keith:	what was the food like on board? hopkins:	well that’s another thing. we got food that we had never eaten before. we never had corn flakes, we didn’t know what they were corn flakes. different thing we got on the ship we had never eaten before. we didn’t like them because… keith:	what else for example? hopkins:	orange juice because in the old country we got an orange. one orange in our stock in the christmas that’s the only time we got orange in christmas in our stock one orange.  so we thought the food was great on this ship because of the things that we had never eaten.  keith:	on the boat were there things that you had never seen before? hopkins:	yeah, well no just that well i remember this great big dining room. it was big to me. i don’t know really how big it was and then these long tables. but my brother and i we went to every meal. so yeah we had a good time. keith:	now your mum suffered for how long on that trip? hopkins:	well i can’t remember that. i imagine she had good days and bad days but she was really sick. just upset stomach and that, and my sister too. i don’t remember i think she was in the dining room a couple of times but i can’t remember and there was when we were really sick they didn’t have a good time like my brother and i did. keith:	now you we’re allowed on deck you said. hopkins:	yeah. keith:	was there any entertainment for you on the ship? hopkins:	yeah there was people playing constantine and whatever instrument they brought with them because they were done and they went down below and singing. then we played ball and we saw a couple of whales come and cross yeah. everybody saying, “come and see the whale,” and then you’d go out and see it out there spouting. so i remember, i held my little brother hand all the time that’s why we’re close today i guess. keith:	you said that your mother and sister was seasick, was the voyage rough? hopkins:	yeah, some of it was rough. keith:	were there storms or any? hopkins:	yeah some it i think there was waves. there was really roughty not like the ships are today. keith:	do you remember seeing land for the first time? hopkins:	no except when the, no i don’t remember till the captain said anybody that wants to see statue of liberty come up and such and such to deck. then my brother and i went up. keith:	did you know what it meant the statue of liberty? hopkins:	oh! yes we were anxious waiting to see the statue of liberty because we knew that it was going to be a good country and we were going to there to live. in fact when i went on that trip to new york i was braced myself and i took a nerve pill that i wasn’t going to cry when i saw the statue of liberty. keith:	so what was the reaction on board of the other people, were they all cheering? hopkins:	yeah. keith:	so that means a lot to you then. hopkins:	yeah. keith:	do you remember seeing new york too, the skyline? hopkins:	no, just the statue of liberty and it was misty. but this last time i did see the skyline when we went back 2 years ago. keith:	so you couldn’t see the skyline. hopkins:	no i don’t remember the skyline, all i remember is seeing this big statue in the vague or whatever it is and it was misty. it was early in the morning but when we went back i saw it really clear. i did break down just 2 years ago when i did see it. keith:	actually, many people whom we interviewed have the same reaction about seeing the statue. hopkins:	isn’t that something? keith:	what about now what happened once you got past the statue what happened then? hopkins:	then we went in to the big room. we all had a tag. keith:	okay we’re going to take a little break for a moment for this tape. all right so you mentioned that you got to ellis island, how did the boat get to ellis island or how did you get from the boat to ellis island sorry? hopkins:	i don’t know if we just walked down the game planned or whether we had a little boat to take us. i don’t remember. all i remember getting into this real big room with lots of people. then they tagged us, we all had a name tag on. then they would take people up to examine them on a second floor. keith:	how were you treated at ellis island? hopkins:	very well and they kept us so long then we all got box lunches which was good as i remember it was a good lunch. keith:	did you have a medical examination? hopkins:	yes. keith:	so you waited… hopkins:	they looked in your hair and i remember this one beautiful irish girl she had long hair and she was crying and crying and we were wondering, what was the matter with her? i don’t know who found out but they came back and told us that she had tb and they were sending her back to ireland but she had i remember then beautiful red long hair and they send her back. they did send some people back. keith:	were you or anyone if your family frightened that they’d send you back? hopkins:	no, except my sister was frightened that they were going to cut her hair. keith:	where do you think that rumor came from?	 hopkins:	i don’t know and then another thing they told us when you get to america you have to call everybody ma’am. like your school teachers, yes ma’am, no ma’am and well that kind of scared us because we didn’t do that in the old country. keith:	ellis island did you have to stay there at all? hopkins:	i don’t think so. i think they gave us lunch then we had to get on the train to come to pittsburgh. i remember the train being very dirty and it must have been dark. keith:	on ellis island how did you describe the conditions of the great hall that you were in? hopkins:	well they had nice like it was clean and they had rows and rows of benches for people to sit on. keith:	was there any entertainment at all? hopkins:	not that i remember. no i don’t remember that. keith:	was the hall relatively crowded or would you say? hopkins:	yeah i thought it was crowded, a lot of people. keith:	were there many other people from scotland there? hopkins:	no not that i remember.  keith:	how were the people dressed in the hall? hopkins:	well some of them looked pretty fancy and other people were just medium. some were poor people. keith:	what were you wearing? hopkins:	i know i had like a brown woolen coat on with buttons and this that’s where the tag was.  keith:	that’s where the, so you had a little woolen coat on. hopkins:	yeah brown. keith:	okay so you basically think you stayed there for one day about. hopkins:	yeah maybe and then they gave us a box lunch because we were there a long time. keith:	okay so then how, did someone come to meet? hopkins:	in pittsburgh not that i remember anybody taking us. somebody must have took us and showed us where the train station was to come to pittsburgh. keith:	what were your first impressions of that train trip to pittsburgh? hopkins:	i thought it was awfully dirty. the train that when i got to pittsburgh we came in to be in our station and i was the first one to recognize my dad. i hadn’t seen him for 2 years and you had to go through these glass doors and then i saw him and i ran to him. i was always proud that i was the first one to recognize my father, because my brother was too little and then my sister i don’t know. so i always happy that because he was a great dad. he lived with us and never caused us after when he was up in years. even though he worried us a lot with the smoking because he smoked a lot. i thought he set this house on fire. keith:	so he was there to meet you and then where did you from there?  hopkins:	from there we went to where he lived. he rented a room on the north side and the lady that rented the room let us come there to stay. but we didn’t stay there very long and then he found a house to rent at the east end. keith:	you remember the address? hopkins:	yeah lautner street. i don’t remember the number but it was lautner street. then we went up this big hill to school was highland park school. i have pictures of that of me in there. my brother he was i guess about 4 and the neighbors on lautner street would tell my mother, “put long stockings,” because he just wore little short pants and socks. the neighbors told my mother he should have long stockings, long and black stockings. so she let well he hated them those long black stockings. so we went up there to school in highland park school, and i had a boyfriend. a little black boy was my boyfriend because we never saw very many blacks and his name was mckinley regan. can you imagine me remembering that, mckinley regan and he was nice he treated me nice.  keith:	you went in the school. did anyone make fun of you for being foreign at all? hopkins:	the only thing was that i couldn’t write, all i could do was print. they kind of made fun of that and i had to learn to write everything we learnt in the old country was printing. keith:	were you ever identified as scottish among the other children? hopkins:	oh! yes all made fun of them and i’d say, ‘well if your mother went to china and you were born, you wouldn’t be chinese.” so they made fun because we were scots. i can remember that was my answer to them, i’m not scot. if your mother went to china and you were born you wouldn’t be chinese. that was stalking answer. they used to like to hear us talk especially my sister because we were all about [inaudible 00:38:18]. so i wasn’t very long till i got rid of that brogue, so they wouldn’t know. keith:	how about your mum and dad did they loosen their accents? hopkins:	no, no they didn’t. we have them on tape and it’s something to hear both of them because i had them down here. we had a big party for their 50th wedding anniversary now. my dad was very emotional when we have them on tape but they never lost everything with the accent. but we kids we all lost our brogue.      keith:	how did your parents adopt to life here? hopkins:	very well, i thought very well. keith:	did they seem themselves as english scots? hopkins:	i think american because my dad never wanted to go back to england, some english people do but he said, “no this is my country.” because we even thought he’d like to go back on a trip to see his relatives, all his brothers and sisters but he said no he didn’t want to go back to england. so this was his country. keith:	how about your mum did she have the same reaction?
