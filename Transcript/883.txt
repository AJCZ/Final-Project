( she laughs ) (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: Groom? KHAVLIJIAN: Groom. ( she laughs ) And she didn't want to play with me. I said, "I'm going to tell Mommy." We used to call my mother Amma, because they all used to call her (Armenian), Amma. When I called Mom or Marik it was a shame, like, it wasn't not right, see. That's the way the . . . OFLAZIAN: Why your sister didn't take her with you? KHAVLIJIAN: Because they didn't want to show that they play. ( she laughs ) Uh, (Armenian). Bride and groom. And I used to say, "I'm going to tell my Mommy if you don't take me." And she used to take me. OFLAZIAN: How do you describe your house in Sepastia? KHAVLIJIAN: We had a big, big, a yard when you come in, and it was all marble, big, big. (Armenian), marble. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember . . . KHAVLIJIAN: We had the, we had the water that used to come all the way from far away, but we called (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for fountain. KHAVLIJIAN: Fountain, like. And we had, and two water, and that was a hand. It used to, no, no. It used to run all night and all day, and it was a hand, the breast. So. And everybody used to come and take from our house, but that we never drank, because that was a river. It was dirty, just washing clothes, clothes or things like that. And then we had another water. They used to drink with a pail that was. And that was like that. OFLAZIAN: With hands, you mean? KHAVLIJIAN: With hands. (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: Ms. Khavlijian is explaining how they used to pump up the water from the ground. KHAVLIJIAN: The ground, yeah. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember going to school? KHAVLIJIAN: School? Yes. I remember first grade. And I went, and first grade, I don't know, that there was a little boy, too. And lunchtime he said, "Let's not go to school. Let's go walk around the school, and then we go home and tell Mommy, you know, we went." I said, "You know, my aunt lives right close to the river. She's always sitting there. What she sees?" "Oh," she says, "so what?" We did. And this aunt saw, and then she called me or what, I don't know. And next day, must be it was that they must be, it was Friday, because Saturday there wasn't any schools, see. And my aunt, I don't know how, tells my mother that Alice was walking around with a little boy, and I saw. She didn't go afternoon at school, see. And Saturday my mother caught me, and she hit me, and she said, "Why did you do that?" I said, "I didn't do." (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for boy. KHAVLIJIAN: So, and my mother punished me. She punished me that I shouldn't do that to, you know, not to go to school. And she punished me all day Saturday. OFLAZIAN: What kind of punishment she gave you? KHAVLIJIAN: I don't know. Whatever, I don't know. She put me in the room. We have so many rooms. They have downstairs and the top, all looked like a basement. And we had a basement, too. And we had a cat, and this cat, when we just passed in the middle, always used to make a hole, and he used, she used to make poo-poo and everything. It was pretty hole, and my mother used to get mad. And when they came, I guess that was 1915 maybe, I don't know, before the genocide, when they came, when they put my father in jail because my father used to make guns and everything, money, so they came and they start to put big something to look if my father's hide anything back in the walls, see. But they couldn't find anything real. Well, just the same, and after that we never saw my father. OFLAZIAN: What was the name of the cat? KHAVLIJIAN: I don't know. Pussycat (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: What it look like? KHAVLIJIAN: It was greyish or black or something, it was nice. And always she used to poo right in the middle of the place. OFLAZIAN: Have you ever played with it? KHAVLIJIAN: Yes, no. They used to keep that in the basement for mice or things like that. So, and then one day we were sleeping. We had two cows. The oldest cow had a baby that I don't remember much, but the second time my father and my mother went that the cow is going to have a baby. And they put in the blanket, and my mother, we didn't have a heat or anything, we used to have a big (?) that they make a coal fire. They make that big so the (Armenian) not to be die, keeps warm. OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for baby cow. KHAVLIJIAN: Yeah. (Armenian) So, (Armenian). And my father and my mother, sometimes they used to go visit my uncle's house in (?), and my older sister was the boss. She used to take care of us, and we had a little lamp that with gas you light. There is the gas, and there was a little nipple. My daughter has in the country. So she starts playing priest. She put the blanket on the head, and she start singing or things like that, and she used, that was the, that was my older sister, and while she was playing, the gas lamp fell. And she runned, and she went and she brought water and she put it out, and that happened twice, I think. I don't know. I forgot everything. And they never, never, when my father used to get up, she used to wash his hands and face with the water, I said, in the yard. And then we used to love my father so much, we used to take the towel and one used to stand on the side and one used to hold and give the towel to my father's hand. ( she is moved ) It was nice. And then they came with the, must be the war started or whatever it was. They took it. That was it. We never saw my father no more. ( she is moved ) And when they, if he grants us, they used to say to all the people, they used to find letters that you people go daytime, and they go in the night, they used to say. And he came, Murat, Murat, where the big river that. OFLAZIAN: Murat is the name of the river. KHAVLIJIAN: They used to call Muratket River. OFLAZIAN: We are going to pause for a few moments for the recording engineer to flip the tape. END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE OFLAZIAN: This is Grace Oflazian. We are resuming now the interview of Side B with Mrs. Khavlijian. Mrs. Khavlijian, you just said that they took your father. Who took your father? KHAVLIJIAN: They came, two policemen. OFLAZIAN: Who were these policemen? KHAVLIJIAN: (Armenian), they called. OFLAZIAN: Were they Armenians? KHAVLIJIAN: No, Turkish, Turks. So they came and they took, they put in a prison for a while. OFLAZIAN: Why they took him? Huh? Why they took him? KHAVLIJIAN: Well, I guess, my father used to make guns, and that was his business. So, and sometimes I didn't have too much hair, and the man used to work for him. He used to come, and he used to put me on his ( she laughs ) on him and he used to come and take me to, and my uncle used to have a coffee shop, and he, they used to have, they used to cut hair too, and they used to cut my hair so it gets body, comes better. So, and I used to cut my, I never used to go out late because I was, I used to shame, I didn't have no hair. I used to play in the garden. We had a huge garden, a huge garden, beautiful garden. Pears, peaches, and we had bees that make honey. And my father, when they time that they're going to take the honey out, he used to put something on his face, and we had a low porch from our house on the garden, and we used to watch, that how he, you know, takes the honey out, like. ( she pauses ) And then, I guess, then this, they started to came and the Greeks, there was a lot of greeks in our town. they came at night. They took some rugs and some furniture. They said they were going to immigrant us, so we said, "It's better to give to the Greeks than the Turks." ( she laughs ) They're going to come and take it. That was my older sister. She was, she put a lot of things in the, where the water is, the pump, inside. There was the pump, and there was a cupboard, and she used to open it, and then she caused lots and lots of good things. OFLAZIAN: How old was she then? KHAVLIJIAN: Maybe she was twelve, fourteen, around. She knew. She was, you know, I was, I didn't know anything. And they said, when they came and took, we were going to go and they said, "We're going for the nice places." And my, they knew my grandmother, everybody, but they didn't tell this. They said, "We're going to go very nice, to nice places." And they made bread, they made (?), the rye bread and things like that, and they took. And my sister, we had a, keeps the water cold. It's, but it's not a brass, but it's more thicker than brass, and they keep water, like a pitcher. It's a pitcher, but brass pitcher. There is another word, but I forgot. Whatever it was, and she had, with her hand, on the way that they were take us all day and the night they used to take us someplace and we used to lay down on the floor, like a small, couple pebbles on that, my grandmother. And they start to take the five, six years old babies. My brother, my uncle's children, and my grandmother used to put her skirt top under her, her under it so they didn't see to take the kids. One, my brother's name was Barkev, and my uncle's son was Oskehan. So, and before that, when we went from Haleb, my mother died and my, before died, Oskehan was about my age. And he used to, he used to come and sit next to me, and he used to say to my mother, "Anna, Anna (Armenian)." And, "You make a son to you." And we used to sleep together with him. He died. A lot of people died at that time. OFLAZIAN: Why he died? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: What was the reason of his death? KHAVLIJIAN: Because after that when they took us away, they took our houses and we went, I don't know where we went. They took a lot of places, they used to take us daytime, and we used to sleep night time. OFLAZIAN: Where did you used to sleep? KHAVLIJIAN: Wherever they took us. On the floor, (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for ground. KHAVLIJIAN: Ground, yes. And I don't know. After that, after that we were sitting, a man came. A man came, and my grandmother said, "I have money." That was a station, train, train station. We were sitting there, and he said, "I have money. If you can take us someplace so we pay you." And he says, "All right." He took us. It was kind of half dark and half light. We go about five blocks maybe, like that was their house. They were Turks, Hamma. This was Hamma. OFLAZIAN: Hamma is a city in Syria. KHAVLIJIAN: It's in Arabic country, Hamma Haleb. This was Hamma. OFLAZIAN: Which means that you went from Sepastia to Hamma? KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: By train. KHAVLIJIAN: No, no, no. We walked. No. OFLAZIAN: What happened in the station of train then? KHAVLIJIAN: So, maybe I'm mixing a little bit. They put us to this station, and then they were going to take us. There was someplace that they kill a lot of Armenians. OFLAZIAN: And how old you were at that time? KHAVLIJIAN: Five, six. That's all I was. OFLAZIAN: So where was your father during this time? KHAVLIJIAN: They took him. They took him, the Turks took, the (Armenian), I remember. And they took him and they put all Armenians in a prison, and not only my father. A lot of them, a lot. And then we don't know what they did. And when they start to immigrants us, that we used to walk, and then they used to say, supposed to, some people find the letters that you walk daytime and we walk night time. That's the way, but we never see them. After my, they took the man in a prison. OFLAZIAN: So you did not see your father after. KHAVLIJIAN: Never after, no, no. And then they started to take boys. And my grandmother, you know, they would all, they used to wear those wide skirts, and my uncle's son and my brother, they, she used to hide them under her skirt that they'd be saved. OFLAZIAN: So you walked through the desert of Syria, right? KHAVLIJIAN: And you know what kind of, what kind of, it was this big. They called Haladada. You know what's Haladada? They called, that was a blood mountain, they used to call. And we walked this much. I don't know how my mother saved us, believe me. And it was so high, if you just put your one feet down, you'd be killed, that high. Very cruel, very cruel. OFLAZIAN: So what did you eat in the desert? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: What did you eat in the desert? KHAVLIJIAN: Well, whatever they took with them, you know. They make a lot of things. And I guess whatever you, I don't know. ( she laughs ) OFLAZIAN: So you came to Hamma, right? You said you came to Hamma. KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. We came to Hamma, and then this, he was a Turk, this man. OFLAZIAN: Who was that man? KHAVLIJIAN: He used to let me where the trains are, you know. About five, ten minutes from his house. So my grandmother says, she says, "Look, these children. Maybe you have some room or somewhere. I have money. We pay for you." See? And our money, my sister (?), she's in an old age home, she saved it. We, they had a pail like this. It's a pink cab. So my grandmother put all gold pieces, you know, big (Armenian) or (Armenian), all those things made. OFLAZIAN: Armenian jewelry, gold jewelries. KHAVLIJIAN: So, and he put in that can, in the oil. You can match (?). OFLAZIAN: The Armenian word for oil. KHAVLIJIAN: And she gave that to my sister to carry. She says, "You're little." Oh, and Sepastia, where we came for one day or what, everybody knew who was there. We are rich, we are poor. And the Turks were this way, like you and me. They look our clothes, everywhere. And he, one of them, he said to my grandmother, "I know," he says, "we know, you have a lot of money." And my grandmother said, "You took it. We left everything. We didn't take anything. We haven't got anything." He says, "Lying, we had the money. It's in the can." And my grandmother said, "You will try to sneak the other side." And she did. That's why real we are saved. Otherwise we never, never would have survived. We used that money for the train. We used, we went when this person came, and he kept us and we gave money, and they never opened the door. They were Arab Turks. Arab was nice to us, really. Nobody took us nowhere. Arabs took. OFLAZIAN: You mean the Syrian Arabs? KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: But they are Muslim too, right? KHAVLIJIAN: Yes, this was Muslim. OFLAZIAN: Weren't you scared of them? KHAVLIJIAN: No. They were very nice to us. They gave us a big room, and they put a straw, you know. And then we slept there for the while, because we were in that street they sent you to. Oh, my God. Where I become, (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: Dezor, you mean? KHAVLIJIAN: Dezor, yeah. OFLAZIAN: They took all the Armenians to Dezor, and killed them. KHAVLIJIAN: Dezor. OFLAZIAN: And killed them. KHAVLIJIAN: They all killed. And these people saved us. And then we, and my mother, she left us there. She says, and there was a lot of people that they, where the railroad is. They're sleeping on, you know, on the floor, that they're going to carry somewhere else, give them a room, whatever it was. So she saw one of our cousins. Her name was Bitha. She brought with her, she says, "At least if I go buy something my children wouldn't be alone with these people." You know, they were very nice but, you know, after all, a mother is different. She don't know when she leave us. So she came. She came with us, and she was (Armenian). My mother went . . . OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for smart. KHAVLIJIAN: Yeah. She was (Armenian). So she said to my mother, "Let's take the children, must be there is a church here. After all, there is not all Muslims. Must be there is a Christian, too. Let's go, go find out where the church, or things like that." And then they took us and they found a church, a Greek church. And then they found a room, is house. OFLAZIAN: Is this in Hamma? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Is this in Hamma? KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. This is in Hamma. So, and then they came and they took us. It was one room. And she was, and this girl, she had a girlfriend, and they were young. They said they don't want to stay with my mother. They want to go, you know, their own, like. So, and they went. One of them, both of them, I think. They got married with a Turk. And then later on, later on they, they came back later on. I guess, I don't know, they want to survive or they didn't want to bother with my mother. Whatever it was. So when we went this Greek church there was a little house, maybe like this. We used to sleep on the floor. Until I don't know, (?) got everything. Until this man, he works in a railroad. My mother says I have money, can you take me to Haleb. So he took us Haleb. OFLAZIAN: Do you remember for how long did you stay in Hamma? KHAVLIJIAN: Hamma? OFLAZIAN: Yeah, for how long? KHAVLIJIAN: Maybe one year. I don't know. You know, I was young. And I don't know. I used, it was Hamma, or Haleb. I don't remember. But I think it wasn't Haleb. Maybe Hamma. I, we start, we used to go. There was another, he's living, this guy Kirshayon, his name. And when we went we met them there, and we used to, and I was, we used to go later to . . . OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for mountain. KHAVLIJIAN: Mountain to get some wood so to make, you know, cooking or things like that. And my mother used to say, "Go, go." She used to say, "(?)." ( she laughs ) She didn't like that much. But she want to have wood, too. And we used to go. The Turks, there was a mountain. We don't know where we went, and this, so they, every Friday they come and they have a picnic, like. They have everything. When they saw us, they gave us whatever they had. They knew that we were Armenian, you know. Of course they knew. So, and everything they used to give us. OFLAZIAN: Like what? Like food, you mean? KHAVLIJIAN: Food, bread, and what they had, eggplant, you know, on the fire. They cleaned, those things with (?), like that. They used to keep us. (?). ( she laughs ) OFLAZIAN: So after you left Hamma, you came to Haleb, right? KHAVLIJIAN: My mother, there was, they were going because there was no work, too, nothing. How much money you can have, it's gone. So my, a little twelve years old boy, he knows how to go to Haleb, and he takes, like, a few families, but I don't know how many days. So, and my mother says, "I want to stay. We go, too. What I'm going to do here?" And we went. I don't know how many days we walked until we got Haleb. And there was, what they used to call? Not Gardnershach. I don't know. So we went there, and then a couple of days we slept in the church outside the, you know, church. And how much they're going to keep. And then somebody came, they know, we know. He said, he took us Hokedun. There was a place that they used to call Hokedun. OFLAZIAN: Was this an Armenian church? KHAVLIJIAN: Like a, huh?

And he gave a job to sit on the door that, you know, a couple of dollars, what they give, not money, but bread or things like that. Bread was enough anyway. So that, that's the way.

We are resuming now the interview of Tape Two with Mrs. Khavlijian. Mrs. Khavlijian, you told us that your mother died in Haleb. So where did you go then? What happened to you? KHAVLIJIAN: Well, we went. We knew there was an orphanage there. They used to call Aharon, (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for orphanage. KHAVLIJIAN: Orphanage, yes. OFLAZIAN: Was that an Armenian orphanage? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Was that an Armenian orphanage? KHAVLIJIAN: It was an Armenian orphanage. They took us, but they didn't take us. We had to go sit outside. We stayed a couple of days, and we slept outside the orphanage. Maybe they thought we were lying or something that we have family. They want to rid of us or what, we don't know, but that's the way it happened. But, anyway, they took us. OFLAZIAN: So did you go with your sister and brother? KHAVLIJIAN: My brother that . . . OFLAZIAN: Barkev. KHAVLIJIAN: Oh, yes. Only Barkev was with me. OFLAZIAN: Where was your older sister and other sister? KHAVLIJIAN: They stayed in, uh, Zoronoltz.

So she went there. There wasn't any soldiers. It was empty, so they put all Armenians there. See, they had little rooms, big rooms, things like that. And then we used to, with my Arshlous sister, she was in the orphanage, and my brother died. So he cried and cried. OFLAZIAN: What was the reason of his death? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh?

And she says, "I'll take care. I have my big son." She had one son about my age, and I couldn't eat. I used to look inside. There was a lot of children. You know, (Armenian). They're all, I used to get sick. So, and I couldn't. After that what happened? ( she sighs ) OFLAZIAN: So this woman, did she took you to her house? KHAVLIJIAN: Which woman? OFLAZIAN: You were just talking . . . KHAVLIJIAN: Bizar? OFLAZIAN: Bizar, yes. KHAVLIJIAN: It's, she's in the orphanage too, but she has, you know, she was different. Her, with her son and things like that. And we just, we played and things like that. And then we . . . I don't remember. OFLAZIAN: So did you go to her house? Did you go to her house? KHAVLIJIAN: No, no. She was in an orphanage. They used to have, but, you know, they were more private, like they had rooms like that. There was a lot of rooms. OFLAZIAN: So tell me, how long did you stay in the orphanage? KHAVLIJIAN: I stayed and then they had some kind of (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: She doesn't know how people came and they robbed the priest's daughter from the orphanage. KHAVLIJIAN: Sisters, they were. And then I was there. We were there, a lot of them. OFLAZIAN: Who took them away? Who were these people? KHAVLIJIAN: Turks. OFLAZIAN: The Turks. KHAVLIJIAN: The Turks. So, and then it got calmed down, like. And it was all right, whatever they gave us we used to eat. And this Dickin Bizar person, she always take care of me until, you know, I got used to it. I used to cry. After that I don't remember. OFLAZIAN: So tell me, how long did you stay in this orphanage? KHAVLIJIAN: Not much, not much. It got lost. It got lost. It didn't last too long. That was just for that time, I guess they had. OFLAZIAN: So where did you go then? KHAVLIJIAN: Oh, and one day they came, they were looking the Turks. They were dressed nice, they covered. They want to take . . . OFLAZIAN: Their faces were covered. KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: Their faces were covered? KHAVLIJIAN: Yeah. They're called (Armenian). So, and they took me. OFLAZIAN: The Turks took you? Where did they take you? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Where did they take you? KHAVLIJIAN: State house. Well, I guess they did good. But it was lots of Armenians saved, and (Armenian).

It was big. Lots, all Armenians they put. There was nowhere else. So, and then they took me, and this was, they were beautiful people, very nice. She had a married daughter, and she had a son was just married. And her name was Assoum (Armenian). Very, very nice. And her daughter-in-law, she used to give me a broom to sweep the yard.

KHAVLIJIAN: He wasn't ordinary man. And he had one son and one daughter. The son was married and the daughter was married, and she gave me the broom, and she, this woman (?), she says, "This (?) going to sweep the floor?" She says, "You." She gave the broom, and she never bothered no more. And my sister, when they took me, she comes back again, walks, to see where they take me. And a couple of times she came. I didn't open the door. OFLAZIAN: Why did you not open the door for her? KHAVLIJIAN: Because I didn't want to go where they are. This place was, you know, like father and mother taking care of me. I didn't know better than that. So she comes a couple of times, and they had, I used to look, and I couldn't open, and I never used to tell them to. I used to keep that myself. And one day my sister come again. I opened the door. She brought two, three woman. They grabbed me. ( she laughs ) They grabbed me, and then they took me to the orphanage. And I used to cry, this time this (?) took me to this (?), so I play. OFLAZIAN: Had you ever heard in those days people talking about America? KHAVLIJIAN: I never. Oh, I heard when we were in my sisters or those Armenians. I don't know if that's before or after, that I don't know. But my aunt heard that we are alive, that this sister is alive. Right away we were in (Armenian). You know what is (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: (Armenian) is the Armenian word for mosque. KHAVLIJIAN: Right, right. And we were there, and she sent a thousand dollars to make passport and come America. OFLAZIAN: Was your aunt here? KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. OFLAZIAN: In America. KHAVLIJIAN: Yes. My uncle died that time. When the war came in, you know, when it was war. He worked so hard that he had to make coffins, that much there were people dying that time. And they were very busy. He was making coffins. OFLAZIAN: What you were doing in the mosque? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: What you were doing? KHAVLIJIAN: The mosque, it had all small rooms like that. There was no place, so they'd put us in the mosque. And they were hunting in the door. They used to watch. They used to watch. They were nice. You know, just watch. OFLAZIAN: Were these the Syrian Moslem people? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: Were these Syrian Moslem people? KHAVLIJIAN: These two men? I think they were Moslems. You know, (Armenian). OFLAZIAN: That's the (?), you mean? KHAVLIJIAN: Because people, my sister used to stay in Jammi. We were in an orphanage when we used to come from this to visit her. See, that's the time. OFLAZIAN: So how did you receive this money from your aunt? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: When your aunt sent you the money, right, and the visa? KHAVLIJIAN: My aunt sent the money, and my older sister, we had a cousin by my father's side, I think. And he used to live in the Jammi. They give everybody room to have, you know, room. A (?), they'd had. And my sister, they took my sister to their house over there, and they had a son. They were I guess married that time or, and they had a little boy. And she used to take care of the boy. So, and when my sister, when we put our, my sister put our name, that who we have anywhere. So my sister knew that we have an uncle and an uncle's son. That's a different, the oldest son. They came to America when, the start, taking the young boys, Turks, around that time they came. OFLAZIAN: So he run away during that time. KHAVLIJIAN: Yeah. And we, we sent telegram or (Armenian). I don't know. So they came and they found us, and this (?) gave a job to my mother. She used to sit (Armenian). They used to call (Armenian), but it wasn't so much sick, but they used, you know, just like that. That's the (Armenian). I don't know what this is. OFLAZIAN: Okay. Tell me what happened after you heard from your aunt. How did you manage to get out from Haleb with your sister? KHAVLIJIAN: We got, it wasn't Haleb. I think it was in Atanna. I think it was Atanna.

KHAVLIJIAN: And one day we used to go to the church and they came, some people. They went to church and they came, "Agavnyr, Agavnyr, you got money in the church." (Armenian) OFLAZIAN: Agavnyr is your older sister, right? KHAVLIJIAN: Yeah. He says, "Go. Your name is, you know, the church." That was, at that time we were Norhadian. So my sister goes and she comes running, laughing. She says, "Nine hundred dollars for (Armenian)." They received one hundred dollars from America. OFLAZIAN: So, and then what did she do with this nine hundred dollars? KHAVLIJIAN: Huh? OFLAZIAN: What did she do? KHAVLIJIAN: And my sister was, we have a cousin, she's taking care of their son, you know. And she says, "Wait. Money comes from America, she's going to put (Armenian)." ( she laughs ) OFLAZIAN: So tell me, how did you manage to come to America? KHAVLIJIAN: And then how we did it? We had, we came Beirut, and then from . . .

And this man, he said that if you go three of you, you get caught. At least leave one. And they walked to, from Hamma to Beirut. From Hamma to Haleb, I'm sorry, Haleb. And then I stayed there, and this man, they kept me, I don't know for how long. So that was Armenian. That was somebody Armenian that they knew there. He tried to make my papers, see.
