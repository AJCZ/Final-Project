APPLEBOME: This is Edward Applebome, and I'm speaking with Mrs. Nancy Fuschetti on Thursday, October 10, 1985. We are beginning this interview at 3:30 in the afternoon. We are about to interview Mrs. Fuschetti about her immigration experience from Italy in 1913. Mrs. Fuschetti, can you tell me where and when you were born and what your maiden name was? FUSCHETTI: Yes. My name, my maiden name was Sciacca, S-C-I-A-C-C-A, and I was born in Italy, Bronte, Provincia de Catania. APPLEBOME: Ooh, you'll have to spell that one for us. FUSCHETTI: Bronte, B-R-O-N-T-E, Province of, uh, Catania, the Province was Catania, and Sicily, in 1906. APPLEBOME: In 1906. FUSCHETTI March, March 3rd, March 6th, 1906. APPLEBOME: And what do you remember about life in your native country? FUSCHETTI: Well, I remember faintly that we had made three trips to America. The first time we made it I was nineteen months. My father came to the States to look for work, and my mother didn't like it here. He stayed on, and we went to Europe. Then he called us back, he told us to come back, and I was three years old. APPLEBOME: Where in the United States was he living then, do you know? FUSCHETTI: Cherry Street. 222 Cherry Street, in New York City. That's a way from Staten, from Ellis, let me see, South Ferry. It's not too far from South Ferry. APPLEBOME: What had your mother not liked about the United States? FUSCHETTI: She didn't like it, she didn't like it here. She had to work here, where in Europe she didn't, she didn't have to go to work. She did not like it here. She went to work in a, in a chocolate factory, left me as a baby. I remember very faintly, they used to call it a five cent school. Then she went back to Europe. She didn't like it here. Then my father came and picked us up and, we, and brought us here again, three years old. I was three, and, and Josephine was born. This one was born in America, the second one. APPLEBOME: Your baby sister. FUSCHETTI: She's second. The third, my baby sister's the one she's holding in the lap that she had when we came the third time to America. This boy was born in Europe because, see, all these trips that we were making, like they asked her in Ellis Island, how come this boy was born in Europe. She said I, you know, she meant to say, "I was pregnant," she said, "I planted the seeds in the United States." I remember that very clearly. And he was born in Amer-, in Italy. Then, when he was born, he was, oh, you should see him, what an attractive boy he is. Blonde, blue eyes. Nobody took him for an Italian when he worked in the bank. He's the one that, uh, uh, worked for Manufacturer's Trust, vice president. Now he's retired. He's seventy-four. APPLEBOME: Let's talk a little bit about Italy again. FUSCHETTI: Yes. APPLEBOME: You had come to the United States for a second time when you were three? FUSCHETTI: Yes. And then, and then we went back again. We went alone, and my father made a couple of visits down there. APPLEBOME: Your mother hadn't liked it again? FUSCHETTI: My mother didn't want to come here. Then, the third time, he was sick. He was at Gouverneur Hospital in New York City. That's in Gouverneur Street, I thin it is, in New York City. And he sent us a letter to leave everything, we had a house there and everything, leave everything, immediately come here, because he was very sick. Somebody wrote it for him. Okay. We came here. The three of us. We took the Giuseppe Verdi boat that took thirteen days to get here. APPLEBOME: How did you feel about leaving under those conditions? FUSCHETTI: Well, I was going to school there, and I used to write to my father, you know, in Italian, and I was going to school there. I was more advanced than the others were here, you know. When I got here . . . APPLEBOME: What was your family doing for an income, then, in Italy, while your father was . . . FUSCHETTI: my father, we had trees, almond trees. We had almond trees and pistachio trees, and my mother used to live by, by that. I remember when the time came to, um, collect all these almonds, we had a big room there and we used, she used to put them over there to dry because the almonds have to, uh, things. One is like a peach on the outside, green, and then the other one is the almond, that has to come out. Anyway, that has to dry, and we used to sell that. And my mother used to, I had an uncle there that used to, took care of my mother. See, my mother was without a man, and she had to have somebody helping her. And we had these trees, and we lived by this. My father did not like it. He did not like to stay there. He wanted to come and making a living here. He went to Argentina, my father. And we didn't want to go to Argentina. He wanted to learn to be a barber, he wanted to learn to be a shoemaker, but my mother didn't go. He went alone to Argentina. See, and all this was taking place and, uh, we spent enough money on boats and trips. Well, the third time, when we, uh, when we came, as I was telling you, that he was sick, we came alone, my brother Nunzio, his name is Nunzio, Josephine and I, we came. We got off, Ellis Island . . . APPLEBOME: Where had the boat left from in Sicily, do you remember? FUSCHETTI: Eh, usually they say embark from Palermo, I think. APPLEBOME: From Palermo? FUSCHETTI: Almost, I think, you know. Can't remember everything. APPLEBOME: Do you remember anything about the boat trip over? FUSCHETTI: Yes, yes. We traveled third class, 'cause we had no money. Third class, and we had bunk beds, and these people spilled something on my mother's cookies there. She had made cookies to come to America. You know, she said, she figured the kids might want some biscotti, she made. Are you Italian? APPLEBOME: No. FUSCHETTI: No. She made those cookies, yes, I remember that. And, uh, those people there, they had children up there, and they messed up all our things that we were carrying. Okay. Then, when we landed . . . APPLEBOME: No, but tell me more about the boat trip. Do you remember seeing other people on the boat? FUSCHETTI: Yes, yes, but, you know, I can't remember everything. No, not on the boat. APPLEBOME: Were you able to stay well on the boat trip? FUSCHETTI: Yes, yes. We were well. APPLEBOME: What did you and your sister and brother do? Did you play? FUSCHETTI: Yes. Sure we did. We, we played by ourselves. But it took so long . . . APPLEBOME: Was it mostly Italians on the boat, do you know? FUSCHETTI: Yes, there were, there were Italians, but I don't remember any of them. No. I just remember, now, when we landed in Ellis Island, my uncle came to pick us up with a little boat, a little, eh, uh, from South Ferry, he had to come to Ellis Island. He had to come in a little boat. And my mother, when she saw him, she said, "My husband must be dead. He's not here." So he screamed, he says, "Salvatore esta bene," you know, he's all right. "Don't worry," he said, "he's all right." So when I got out of there, a tall woman approached me, an American. And she sort of, you know, took a liking to me. She gave me a banana. And when she gave me that banana, I had never seen a banana in Europe, I took the whole banana with the peel and put it in my mouth. So she came, she said, "No, no, no." So she took the peel off and I ate it. As a matter of fact, then I started school. I, I didn't know how to speak a word when I came, in English. APPLEBOME: When you traveled over under this emergency, did you take all your family belongings with you? FUSCHETTI: No. We left our house. We left out house there. My uncle took care of it. But then . . . APPLEBOME: Did you know you were traveling because your father was ill? FUSCHETTI: Yes. Now, we didn't want to go back no more. When we started to go to school over here in America, then my brother, and my sister went to school, my brother went to school, as time went on, we spent ten years in East, eh, eh, in the East Side there, you know, near Canal Street, Mulberry Street, Hester Street, Cherry Street, those were our places. They were all Jewish people, I didn't understand what they were talking about, you know. And I used to go downstairs, my mother would send me, to go to the store and get two eggs, two eggs and, she knew how to speak a little English. I'd go, and I'd say two eggs, two eggs, two eggs, all the way there, and then I'd forget what to say. But, uh, then I started to go to school, when I started to go to school, they put me in a class, an advanced class, because I had intelligence, you know. I had, I knew how to read and write letters to my father, and they were teaching me alphabets here. So then, when I started to go to school, I graduated at P.S. 177, New York City. APPLEBOME: Tell me more, when you came into the country and you thought your father was so ill, how had things turned out? FUSCHETTI: Everything turned out well. He got better. He died when he was eighty-six. My mother died in '59. So he was all better then. Then he was working for Con Ed, Con Edison, yeah. You know, laborer. APPLEBOME: Did he get out of the hospital right after you were in the country? FUSCHETTI: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Then we went to the place. APPLEBOME: Do you remember what your feelings were coming into the United States? FUSCHETTI: Well, we didn't like it. I didn't want to leave, uh, uh, Europe, because I was going to school there, I had friends there, and my mother didn't want to come here, but we had to come because he was very sick. APPLEBOME: What was it about the United States that you didn't think you would like? FUSCHETTI: Well, you know, I didn't know how to speak. I didn't like it, but we had to make our, uh, home here. APPLEBOME: What was it that you didn't like? FUSCHETTI: See, uh . . . APPLEBOME: What did your father, when he wrote to you, what had he told you about the United States? FUSCHETTI: He said that he was working and he wanted us over here. He was working. But he was sick then, when we came, see, he was, he was here. So the three of us traveled, and when we got here, we, we, we were examined. I remember very well that we were examined at Ellis Island. Those that had bad eyes they put them aside, and those that were good they passed them, we passed. Yeah, all of us were perfect, my brother, my sister and I. APPLEBOME: What else happened on Ellis Island? FUSCHETTI: And they asked us, you know, all these questions, how come this girl was born in Italy, and this boy was born in Italy, and this girl was born in a? And my mother had to explain to them that we had made several trips. See, Josephine lives in Brookline. She is younger than me, two years. I'm seventy-nine, she's seventy-seven. She was born in New York City, Hamilton Street. Then came Nunzio, he was born in Europe. But my mother was pregnant from the United States, and he was born in Europe. APPLEBOME: I understand. FUSCHETTI: Then the three of us came. Well, once we started that . . . APPLEBOME: Before the boat came into the harbor and you got onto Ellis Island, do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty? FUSCHETTI: Yes, yes. That Statue of Liberty, I used to travel every, every morning, when we lived in Staten Island. APPLEBOME: But when you came into New York for the first time . . . FUSCHETTI: Yes. APPLEBOME: When you were six, so it wasn't really the first time, did you get out on deck and see the Statue of Liberty? FUSCHETTI: Yes, yes. We all got out and watched it, b that's the trip we make. Not knowing that some day we were gonna live in Staten Island. See, we stayed ten years in New York City, then we moved to Staten Island. I was seventeen when I got married. APPLEBOME: So the first time you saw the Statue of Liberty did you have any feelings about it? FUSCHETTI: No, no. You know, America, that's all, that's America. All I saw was Cherry Street, and all these Jewish people that had this bread, you know, the black bread. I said, and the way they talked, I said, "Mom, the way they talk." APPLEBOME: It bothered you? FUSCHETTI: Yeah, you know, they were nice people, though. We got along with them. As a matter of fact, when we had to move, Mrs. Zaretsky was crying. She didn't want to see us moving. See, after we were here ten years we didn't want to stay there. We bought a house in Staten Island, and we made our residence there. Most of our thing, was done in Staten Island. I lived there forty-five years. See, I was married at seventeen, we bought a house together with my mother in Staten Island, and then we traveled to go New York to work, she and I, in the garment. APPLEBOME: Tell me about when your family had first come to the United States, then, and you're a girl now, you're six years old. FUSCHETTI: Yes. APPLEBOME: What was your life like growing up as a young immigrant in New York City? FUSCHETTI: Well . . . APPLEBOME: You could tell me about going to school. FUSCHETTI: I went to school, and my mother went to work. She, over years, she had to go to work. APPLEBOME: What kind of work did she do? FUSCHETTI: She did sewing. My mother sewed, and she taught me later on, in the garment district, you know. APPLEBOME: Did you make friends with other children? FUSCHETTI: Yes, sure, sure. As a matter of fact, some children came from Italy, and they asked me to interpret for them after. APPLEBOME: You were able to learn English quickly? FUSCHETTI: Sure, sure. Then, my mother was working, we had a factory that was across from us in New York City. We used to have a line that connected that factory, they were making men's coats. And my mother was finishing. We used to put those coats on the line and we'd just pull it like that and the boss would put in the book to market, and we'd get our pay from him. It was Pike Street. I remember very clearly. And we, we went to school and we worked, and we learned how to sew, too. My mother was taking work in, because she had small children then, and she used to take work in. And we sold, uh, finishing these jackets, men's coats. She used to make buttonholes, my mother. And we helped. So we used to, we used to make good money. At that time, twenty dollars in one day we made, to help finishing these men's coats. APPLEBOME: You and your sister would help? FUSCHETTI: Yes. APPLEBOME: What about your brother? FUSCHETTI: My brother was little then. Yeah. He was little. He used to take the bastings out, the bastings out. You know, the bastings. Oh, yes, we all chipped in. And then we went to work, my mother went to work, my sister used to do the cooking, my mother used to go to work in the garment, in the garment. APPLEBOME: What kind of apartment did you live in? FUSCHETTI: It was a, like a railroad, 222 Cherry Street. Now, if you go there, it's Knickerbocker Village. APPLEBOME: Do you know why you were living in a Jewish neighborhood rather than in an Italian neighborhood? FUSCHETTI: Well, because my aunt and my uncle lived there and my father lived there. See, my father's brother was living there. They had seven children, seven children. They were, uh, apartment houses. We were on the fifth floor. APPLEBOME: Did your mother still talk about going back to Italy? FUSCHETTI: Sure. But then we didn't want to go any more. After we, we made our home here. We children didn't want to go back to Europe. You know, my brother started to go to school, the other ones in school, and we didn't want to go. Then I got married and we made a, a living. We used to make a living, after. I worked too, with my mother. And we traveled from Staten Island, we traveled on that Staten Island ferry for a nickel, a nickel. And we could see that s every day, every morning. We made three changes, and I worked in the garment indus--, uh, eh, district, 34th Street. We used to make ladies' garments, and that paid good. That paid very good. I worked for a little while, and then I had babies and I didn't work for eight days. I had two children, a boy and a girl, I had. And I didn't work. But then, when they were older, 1930, I remember, those were bad years, 1930. That's when my son was born, and I think the stock market, everything, went down at that time. APPLEBOME: Have you ever been back to Sicily? FUSCHETTI: Yes. I was. I went back twice. Once I went with my husband, Mr. Fuschetti. He had not been to Europe in sixty-five years. And we went to Naples, he was from Naples. And he went to see the home that he was born, and also the school that he went, but there was nobody left there, all of his family had died. That was once. Then I went again last year, with y brother, and I went to Catania, and went to Taormina, where I met all my cousins there that I didn't realize there were. They're, they're building condos there. And he's well off, one of them. He sat in a restaurant, we sat in his restaurant, on our way to come home, we were gonna go to Catania to take our plane to come home. And this, uh, nephew of ours, he said we'll stop over after we, I wanted to see Taormina, you know, and went to the gift shop. When, we sat in one of those restaurants, they had eggplants and pasta. Very delicious. Along comes this fella, and I looked at him. I says, he had blue eyes. I said, gee whiz, he looks so familiar. When he sat next to me, I said, "Excuse me." I said, "What's your name?" in Italian. He says, "My name is Vito Riali." Vito Riali! (Italian), I said to him. "You're my cousin." His mother and my mother were sisters. He's a grandson, this one. So, with that, I says, "This is my brother." My brother is seventy-four now, and he traveled with me. APPLEBOME: And is your father's part of the family the only group that came over from Italy? The rest of your mother's family had stayed? FUSCHETTI: My mother, no, my father's family, only one brother was here. The other brothers stayed there. They didn't want to come. They made a living, he was, you know, doing gardening, agriculturing. APPLEBOME: Did your father come because his brother was here? Had he heard about the United States? FUSCHETTI: Yes, yes. My brother, my uncle was here and he came over here. But then he left him and he went to South American, Buenos Aires, and he, he came home to us and he talked to us about Buenos Aires. My mother did not like it. No. She did not want to go there. But he was trying to learn a, a trade. And then he ended up in the United States, there, New York City, again. APPLEBOME: Did he ever talk to you about what it was like when he first came into the United States? FUSCHETTI: Yes, he went all over looking for jobs. All over. Went to, went to, uh, where did he go, Chicago? Did he go to Chicago? You know, I, I heard more about him when he was in Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires, Argentina. He used to tell us that there was plenty of meat over there, the meat over there was cheap and the bakers, he said nobody goes, he wanted to stay there and learn a trade, but my mother didn't want to go. APPLEBOME: When you had come into the country, you were on Ellis Island for how long, do you think? FUSCHETTI: Not too long, for a couple of hours, and then we went home, to Cherry street, with my uncle. APPLEBOME: Do you have any other memories of the time you were on Ellis Island, about seeing people from other countries? FUSCHETTI: No, no. APPLEBOME: Or any food you had there? Nothing like that? FUSCHETTI: No, no. I don't remember. We were, we were bewildered, because we thought my father was gonna be dead, because we didn't see him come to meet us at South Ferry there, at Ellis Island. But, uh, he was all right, he was out of the hospital. He had temperatures, you know, but he was okay. APPLEBOME: How had your mother been on the boat trip over knowing that her husband was so ill? FUSCHETTI: Yes, she was very worried, very worried because she didn't expect to find him alive. But it worked out nicely. We just left everything there. My uncle used to send us, the rent he used to get, he rented a house. He used to send us cheese, big, beautiful cheese, you should see that cheese, with black pepper. That I remember. And that's how he, uh, recorporated, you know, reimbursed the money that he used to get from the rent. Then he sold everything, because we made our work, uh, our stay here. Once we started to go to school, who wanted to go back there? We didn't want to go back. This was a better place, this was a land of opportunity. APPLEBOME: Do you remember, as a little girl, how people treated you because you were an immigrant? FUSCHETTI: No, no. They weren't, uh, too bad. No. They weren't. I went to the school in, P.S. 177, Market Street. It was in Market Street, New York City. No. I got along because there were some other children that came, and they used to put 'em in a class where you had to learn, and they used me as an interpreter. APPLEBOME: So your Italian and your English were both good? FUSCHETTI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I learned fast. I graduated 8-B, they graduate them there. Then my mother didn't let me go to school any more, and when my teachers told her she's a bright girl, why don't you let her go, she said because I have, she had five children, and she had, I had to stay home. I had to stay home. I didn't get much training. APPLEBOME: Did you ever write to any of the friends that you had left behind in Sicily? FUSCHETTI: I do write to them, yes. APPLEBOME: Still. FUSCHETTI: I write to them now. Well, the others, I don't remember who they are any more. But I do write to my husband, my first husband, Dinaro. He came from Victoria, Sicily. And he was in this country three years when I met him and we married. I was only seventeen. And, uh, he, he had a mother, a father, sisters and brothers, in Victoria, Sicily. And he was gonna come to, to let me meet his family, but he had cancer. After three, thirty years I was married to him, and I had the two children. He had cancer. In three months, because he worked in the clay, he was a clay molderer, in New Jersey, and he got cancer. In three months, they operated on him, they took the lung out, and he died. And then I was a widow ten years, see. And then, uh, after ten years I met, my husband was in Boston, but he made my daughter's engagement ring, see. And my sister lived here. This is how he proposed to me, from Boston, he came to New York. Then I, I've had, I could write a book, what happened. My daughter left three children. There's my daughter over there, with her husband there. She had a viral infection which burned the cells of the memory. She lost her memory. She was in the hospital one month. And that three children, she lived in my house, because I had a two-family house. And I, uh, took care of those three children for two years, because she had lost her memory. Then she contacted nephritis, and the husband left my house, because I couldn't take care of her any more. But it was the same time that he proposed to me, my husband, Mr. Fuschetti. and I told him, I said look it, I says, I've got three children to take care of, and my daughter. He didn't push it. He just left it that way. He figured some day she'll make up her mind. And my brothers, my two brothers and my brother-in-law said, "Nancy, don't give up that opportunity. He's a fine man." And he was. Very nice. He's a, anybody that hears his name will tell you what an honest man he was. He had a jewelry building, jewelry place in the Jewelry building in Washington Street, Boston. And i had twenty years of him. You know how he died He was going to, December 22nd, he went to, uh, Boston, to wish everybody "Merry Christmas." He had just retired in September. He stepped out of the bus, we used to go with him together every Wednesday to eat out, even when he didn't work any more, that he, but he was partially retired, and he was eighty-seven. He stepped out of the bus here in Arlington, somehow he skipped and step, and he fell, and he got a fractured skull.l He lived twenty days, and he died. It must, and his heart was strong but once, uh, your skull is fractured, you know, he never regained consciousness. Never. He'd look at me. I would visit him every day at the hospital and he'd say, I'd say to him, "You fell down, Sal, you're in the hospital." He'd look at me, but never responded. Never said a word. APPLEBOME: I'm sorry to hear that. FUSCHETTI: They operated on him. They thought they would relieve the blood, you know, that maybe that would help but, as the doctor said to me, either that, or without the operation, he would die. So that's my story. Two years ago, January 12th, he passed away. but I've been getting along, and that's why I like it. There he is. We went to florida together. Here's my husband. Here's his picture there. See, we had a wedding, my, my granddaughter got married in September. APPLEBOME: Let's just hold it for one second, okay? You're going to tell me a little bit about how things were different in Italy from the way they were in the United States, right? FUSCHETTI: Oh, that's what you wanna know. Well, Christmas. We used to go to church with my mother. And Christmas holidays, they used to have all these oranges hanging up. Instead of the, uh, the, the Christmas decorations, they had oranges. And then they'd have those nice songs, "Lucinda D'elle Stelle." I belong to a lodge over here that is Italian, and they have some of these things, songs that they sing. I belong to the Danta Legere Society over here that they opened up, a center, culture center, in Hampshire Road. APPLEBOME: When you got to the United States, how would you celebrate Christmas? It was different. FUSCHETTI: Well, we didn't have all the stuff here. I got married December 23, 1923. I don't remember all this business here. I got married December 23rd, 1923. APPLEBOME: Uh-huh. And what was the wedding like? FUSCHETTI: Well, I had a wedding in Staten Island. I got married, no, I went to church, from Staten Island I went to the Roosevelt Street Church, because I was a St. Mary Society. That's where I originally was, was brought up, in the city. And we had Christmas there, you know, Christmas and New Year's and we used to play cards. APPLEBOME: Let me ask another question, or ask it differently: What were some of the things in this country that you had never seen before? FUSCHETTI: What were, well, as a child of six years old, what could I remember that I didn't see before? APPLEBOME: What surprised you? What looked different? Did you have street cars where you had come from? FUSCHETTI: No, no. Not at that time, no. APPLEBOME: You probably had never seen snow, also. FUSCHETTI: No. No snow, no. It was warm. Sicily was a warm country. Oh, I miss those beautiful trees that we had, Mulberry trees, uh, almond trees, pistachio trees, and they're so pretty, those pistachio trees. Now, when I went to Sicily I saw beautiful things, too. I went with my brother last year. APPLEBOME: There weren't trees like that in New York. FUSCHETTI: No. APPLEBOME: What'd it look like in the neighborhood you had moved to? FUSCHETTI: Oh, it was New York City. It was the slums there. Now they, they've glorified it. They call it, uh, what do they call it now? APPLEBOME: You said Knickerbocker . . . FUSCHETTI: Knickerbocker Village. That's what they call it. FUSCHETTI: Well, you know, I went to school there, 170. APPLEBOME: Did you have enough to eat? FUSCHETTI: Yes. That's, that's, I could remember my mother, we didn't have much money, but we had plenty of food on the table. My mother never skimped on food. She would have plenty of fruit for us, I loved the fruit that, you know, we had. But, uh, and I remember the wine we used to make. I was about twelve years old, I think. And my father, on the fifth floor, imagine, he used to make the wine. They used to go out, with my husband, to buy grapes. Was that in New York City? No. Before New York City, I wasn't married yet, I got married when I was in Staten Island. I remember we made wine, and we used to buy boxes of grapes, and those boxes, I used to carry them from, from the downstairs, to upstairs on the fifth floor. And we made wine. We never drank coffee. Never coffee on our table. It was a little wine at our meals. APPLEBOME: At breakfast? FUSCHETTI: No. A little milk and coffee. She used to make the milk with the coffee in the saucepan, I remember. And that's the way we had it, with a little bread. With bread. No, no, eh, this cereals that they have today, and farina and this and that. A little toasted bread, and that was our breakfast. APPLEBOME: What was different about the clothing, for example? FUSCHETTI: Well, the clothing. I was six years old. Tell me, what could I tell you? I was only interested in children's clothing. Then, you know, I began to see how they dressed nicely here. But there was nothing any better than what they had in Milano. Milano is a city, you know. Have you been to Europe? APPLEBOME: Yes, I have. FUSCHETTI: Is this going to be on Channel 5? FUSCHETTI: No, I don't think this will be on T.V., but we'll see. Okay, but thank you very much. It was an interesting interview. Thank you. This is the end of side one of tape one, and the end of the interview with Mrs. Nancy Fuschetti.
