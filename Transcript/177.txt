boulgouras: 	absolutely, radio city. janet: 	so then when did you come to new hampshire? boulgouras: 	it was less than two days. janet: 	i see and you came by train? boulgouras: 	came by train. my father and the conductor came and he was picking up the tickets from me, his customer and my father stuck his by the row seat and a guy who started to, "hi, ticket, ticket." he says, "boy, you're headed here is the ticket?" he says, “he don't talk in english, so give me those tickets." they used to pick them up but they were not a dollar or two dollars, they were 40 cents, 50cents. janet: 	do you remember arriving here in new hampshire? boulgouras: 	definitely, my father and my mother and i. we landed right down here, they had the biggest rail road’s station right here in this city and it was a bigger station after you leave boston, the next one big one used to be in white rivers in junction vermont, another big one, that’s it. janet: 	yeah, you remember that station?

did you go back into your father's store? boulgouras: 	no, after i got married, no. not right off. i did? i got the direct order from the high command [laughter], you know what i mean? janet: 	so you see, was it your wife says that you did go back and work with your father in the store. boulgouras: 	of course, sure. janet: 	and then did you stay doing that or did you do something else? boulgouras: 	no. janet: 	you stayed there. boulgouras: 	yeah. janet: 	i see, now did you have children? boulgouras: 	yeah. janet: 	three children and their names? boulgouras: 	constantinos was the first one, the second one was federico and the third one was alcibiades, that’s another good one. janet: 	what do you feel very proud of that you have done in your life? what makes you satisfied that you were able to do in your life? boulgouras: 	well, i was not in a position to do what i really wanted, i wanted to go to university to study something but my father says, "i have a small insurance $200," he says, "i'll cash it and with the $200 which would amount of $400, i will give $200 part of the first semester and the second semester i'll give you the balance. in the meantime," he says, "you're going to work in the kitchen with the boys helping, cooking there, washing dishes, big big pots to wash and whatever." janet: 	what kitchen? where was the kitchen? boulgouras: 	well, somewhat-- janet: 	fort deven? boulgouras: 	not fort deven, this way smaller. janet: 	[unclear 00:42:57]? boulgouras: 	[unclear 00:42:58] new jersey no. janet: 	but wait a minute, when you got out of the service then were you still thinking about going to college? boulgouras: 	i was still but after my father told me, he says, "you can go to college, unless if you want to follow classes or college i have a little policy consisting of $200 to go to college." - yeah, i have money. how could i go? janet: 	after you retired, how was your life here in concord? boulgouras: 	fine, it’s alright. well i had changed the routine, i didn't forget about going to college, taking special courses and this and then that. try to get acquainted with voice from various classes and some people i knew them before i had even was inducted and slow but sure i applied myself in. i started picking up little english. otherwise i would have been-- janet: 	how do you feel about having come to this country and lived here in this country all these years? boulgouras: 	it was fine, for me it was like having a new toy. janet: 	do you consider yourself greek and american? boulgouras: 	full-fledged greek. janet: 	what do you think about the melting pot idea? boulgouras: 	that’s just a thing- saying you know otherwise. janet: 	you don't think people melt? boulgouras: 	no. janet: 	so there all the same? boulgouras: 	yeah, i've heard that long time ago. janet: 	do you remember concard from the old days, anything different about it from when you first came here compared to now? boulgouras: 	many many things, a lot of people where they had some [unclear 00:45:22] and they were good buildings, they were not the old sharks, they tore them down and they rebuild them new and then of course in the meantime they expanded, a lot of industry came here, the next town the same thing and the next town the same thing, so that’s how the thing extended. janet:  	were there other ethnic groups besides greek? boulgouras: 	oh yeah. janet: 	what other groups came from what other countries besides from greece? boulgouras: 	mixed from all over, greeks were there, albanians- they claimed they were albanians but they were not. greek descent but they happened to be born in albania and that’s it and then others. a lot of people came from germany and they applied themselves and they had to learn something else. janet: 	so there were quite a few of people who immigrated and settled around here? boulgouras: 	definitely, oh yes. janet: 	okay, is there anything else you can think of about coming to this country that maybe we haven’t really talked about? anything else you can think off about how it affected you coming here or were you glad that you went to greece and studied greek? boulgouras: 	oh no, no that was number one that helped me immensely because if i didn't improve on my greek, how would i be improving my greek from greece? never. janet: 	so you're glad you went back and did that? boulgouras: 	definitely, there is my picture from when we graduated high school in trikala. you see what it says here? trikala. janet: 	1936. boulgouras: 	that’s it. janet: 	oh so then that must be when you came to this country? boulgouras: 	when we graduated high school. janet: 	after you graduated high school? boulgouras: 	not right away, i took one year or two. janet: 	so you maybe you came in 1937. boulgouras: 	just about. now here was the principle of the high school, this was one good professor there john [unclear 00:48:19], this guy was my favorite professor. janet: 	why did you like him? what did you like about him? boulgouras: 	because he was determined to do or die, either you learn or take the door [unclear 00:48:38], a front, side door, rear door we don't need you. if anybody who is around from these people here, this guy was physics and chemistry, this one here too. janet: 	it sounds like you're proud of the education you got in that high school? boulgouras: 	i most certainly was and if i had the opportunity i would proceed without any hesitation. janet: 	do you think you were similar as a father to your children as your father was to you? boulgouras: 	my father wasn't here with me. janet: 	that’s right. he was away a lot while you were growing up. boulgouras: 	sure, i grew away from him. i reminisce. janet: 	you remember anything that happened in your high school class that comes to mind? boulgouras: 	this guy became a major general and a cousin of mine, kind of his he was my classmate and a lot of them right here. this guy here he had a big position with the courts in trikala, that’s me here. this is the guy that became a major general right here. that really brings a lot of memories to me. janet: 	is it interesting to you to think back on these times? boulgouras: 	of course, that’s good food for thought. janet: 	how do you feel now about having come through ellis island, seeing the statue of liberty and all that? boulgouras: 	that was an item that was worthwhile and seeing it from a distance, i went with my family over there, all the kids and all that. janet: 	okay, is there anything else you would like to say before we close? boulgouras: 	well, maybe some other time too we'll finish off [chuckle]. janet: 	okay, i want to thank you very much. boulgouras: 	that’s alright, my pleasure. janet: 	i'm speaking with socrates boulgouras, who was born in the united states, went to greece at about age six and then came back here we think now around 1937 because it was about a year or so after he graduated from high school and i want to thank you very much. this is janet levine for the national park service and i'm signing off.
