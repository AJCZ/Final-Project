Nothing too much alive, you know, to have something. I never went to school over there, never. They never sent me to school. SIGRIST: Was there a school in the town? BERTOMEU: Oh, yeah. Never. Because my mother got a, can I say all this? SIGRIST: Yeah, sure. Go right ahead. BERTOMEU: My mother got six children, and my father die very young. And she got six children. And, you know, she was, very bad for her. We all, I mean, you're small. So anyway, and her, her family, they told her why you don't go to Cuba and take the three. SELLES: The oldest ones. BERTOMEU: The oldest ones, and lead the other ones to a better life, because that was very bad in those times, you know. SIGRIST: Did a lot of Spanish people go to Cuba? Was that a place to go to better yourself? SELLES: Oh, yeah. A lot of people go to Cuba. BERTOMEU: Cuba no like America. ( they laugh ) I like this place better. SELLES: Can I talk now? SIGRIST: Yes, sure, by all means. SELLES: We were okay, you know. See, my father die. My brother, my oldest brother was fifteen, she was twelve, I was seven. Another five, another three, another one-year-old. And my mother, she got, you know, panicked, responsibility, you know. SIGRIST: What did your father die of? BERTOMEU: He got killed. SELLES: He got killed on the train. SIGRIST: Killed on a train? SELLES: Yeah. He died on a train. He was looking out the window and the window fell right on the temple. SIGRIST: Was there, was there a train accident, or did the window just . . . SELLES: No. You know, they were changing the locomotive. They were having a change or something. And they even told him to be careful, because maybe he . . . BERTOMEU: He traveled a lot. SIGRIST: Let me ask Pilar. What did your father do for a living? BERTOMEU: He was a decorator, painter. SELLES: No, he was a contractor. BERTOMEU: A contractor, nice. SELLES: And then he work on the . . . BERTOMEU: But he die on one of those trips.

SIGRIST: To work in the vineyards in California? SELLES: No. He bring it back, he sells that. He was a salesman. And then he went to Mexico. Who knows? SIGRIST: Do you know how your parents met, either of you? Do you know how they met? BERTOMEU: Oh, they were neighbors. SELLES: Well, they were neighbors. BERTOMEU: Neighbors. SELLES: And I remember my mother saying, like when they were born they say, "Oh, they got to get married when they get big." ( they laugh ) Because they were one year old, you know. SIGRIST: They were destined to be together. SELLES: Yeah. SIGRIST: Were both your mother and father from this town? SELLES: Yeah. BERTOMEU: Yes. SIGRIST: Both from this town. Let me ask Sally, what do you remember about your father? What was his personality like? SELLES: ( she sighs ) I don't remember much. I was seven when he died. BERTOMEU: He was a very nice looking man, very educated. SELLES: I have a picture of him, but not here. BERTOMEU: He was very, very good. SELLES: See, I was seven years old, and I . . . BERTOMEU: And he make a good money in those apprentice he doing. When he die on the train, we were in bed. And somebody about twelve o'clock at night they're knocking on the door, and it was the family live more close to the station from the train, more close. They coming with him. She get up, she thought it was, I don't know, somebody. And they tell my father got dead. We don't even see him. They owe a lot of money, they don't give a penny to my mother. SELLES: They deny that they owe the money. BERTOMEU: Denied it. Because he got a lot of money to collect from all that he's doing. But they don't give anything. So my brother was the old one. How old was Henry? SELLES: Fifteen. BERTOMEU: Fifteen, and I was a little older. SELLES: He was the man of the house. SIGRIST: Do you remember, do either of you remember the funeral for your father?

She don't even take care of us. SELLES: You know, with six children and no money, because they even took all the money that . . . BERTOMEU: So the family . . . SELLES: He's got it with him. BERTOMEU: The family say why don't you try to go . . . SELLES: No, hermana [sister]. My brother, he was a (?), you know. And my, a cousin of ours, she says, "Don't let him go alone, because . . . BERTOMEU: He was going to forget us. He was young. SELLES: He was going to forget you. "Why don't you go and take the trip with her." BERTOMEU: And the other one, to marry with her. SIGRIST: Good. Well, let's not get to Cuba yet. I want to talk some more about Spain and growing up in Spain. BERTOMEU: In that time it was very bad. SIGRIST: Sally, can you describe the house that you lived in? SELLES: Oh. Well, the house ( she clears her throat ), it was up. You know, you got to go upstairs. And it's two bedrooms, the kitchen and the dining room. SIGRIST: What was it made out of? SELLES: What it was made out of, that I forgot. Brick? SIGRIST: Pilar, do you remember? SELLES: I think brick. BERTOMEU: Brick. SELLES: Yeah. BERTOMEU: And we got a well in the yard, outside in the yard. It wasn't very, not many rooms, not many rooms. SIGRIST: How, is the climate warm in Spain, or did you ever have to heat the house in any way? SELLES: Well . . . BERTOMEU: Not too much. SELLES: Not a bad winter. The winter wasn't too bad, you know. Just mild. BERTOMEU: It was Galicia. They call Galicia. SIGRIST: Do you remember what kind of furniture you had in the house? Does any piece of furniture stick out in your mind? SELLES: We have chairs, you know. Not sofas like here, chairs, chairs. BERTOMEU: Chairs. The thing is, my father, when he died, before he died he said, "I want to make the house," because we've got a well outside in the yard. SELLES: A spring well, you know. BERTOMEU: A spring well, good water. And he wants to make a nice house, because . . . SELLES: Oh, that was the last trip he was going to make, and then, you know, remodel the house. BERTOMEU: We got nothing. SIGRIST: Can you tell me, I never did ask you, what was your father's name? SELLES: Belisario. BERTOMEU: Belisario. SIGRIST: Can you spell that, please?

BERTOMEU: We have our husbands' name, but they're dead, too. We are widows. SIGRIST: Did your father have parents in this town? Did you have grandparents that were on your father's side? BERTOMEU: No, no, no. SELLES: No, they . . . BERTOMEU: We don't see my father's parents. SELLES: Only my mother's. BERTOMEU: My mother's. SIGRIST: So you were not close with your father's side of the family. SELLES: No. BERTOMEU: No. SELLES: They died. SIGRIST: They all died. Tell me, and what was your mom's name? BOTH: Isolina.

SELLES: A little taller than us. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Let me ask each of you individually, and I'll start with Pilar, when you think back to your mother is there a story that you remember? How do you, is there something that sticks out in your mind about your mother, a certain thing that happened maybe when you were a little girl in Spain? BERTOMEU: She was sweet. But after my father died she don't even send the kids to school or anything. She never sent me to school. She was worrying and never was happy. Only when she went to Cuba she started changing, you know, because she got to work. And over there in Cuba is not like over here. You work as housekeeper in the house for cooking, maid. SIGRIST: Sally, is there, when you think back to being a little girl, of course, you were younger, what sticks out in your mind about your mother? What do you remember? Do you have a story about your mother that you remember? SELLES: Oh, not much. SIGRIST: Your memories are similar to Pilar's memories. SELLES: Yes. She used to, I don't know. SIGRIST: What did she cook for you for food? What did you eat? SELLES: We got a lot of things in the orchard, you know. Grow potatoes, a lot of things. She didn't cook much because nobody work on the, in the, nobody, you know, the crop doesn't . . . SIGRIST: Did you have your own orchard and your own garden? SELLES: Yes, in back of the house, yes. SIGRIST: What kinds of things do people grow in Spain? What kinds of things did you have in the garden? BERTOMEU: Potatoes. SELLES: Potatoes, carrots, lettuce. BERTOMEU: We had a lot of food. SELLES: String beans, lima beans, you know. BERTOMEU: It's a small town, you know. SIGRIST: Did you eat a lot of meat? SELLES: We used to kill two pigs for the whole years, you know. The ham, they separate the hams and they make some, like sausages, but we call it chorizos, with nice lean meat, you know. SIGRIST: Would you raise the pig, and then would someone come in and slaughter it? SELLES: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: How did they do that? SELLES: Well . . . BERTOMEU: They take it out . . . SELLES: My mother's father, my grandfather, used to kill them, and two more men to hold it. So they, I don't know. With a knife they stick it here, I think. ( she gestures ) SIGRIST: Right under the throat. SELLES: To the heart. SIGRIST: The heart. SELLES: And then they, with a torch, you know, they burn all the little hair, you know, that is on the pig, burn it all and wash it all, you know, with a pig hanging. And then they make, you know, the hams, they cut the hams. BERTOMEU: Sausage. SELLES: They cut the ribs, all that. SIGRIST: Because you were a little older, Pilar, did you have to do a lot of work in the house? BERTOMEU: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: Can you tell me some of the things you had to do in the house? BERTOMEU: I had to go to, como se llama el monte? I used to go to, with my brother, to Rige. What you call that? SELLES: Like, let me see, wait a minute, to describe it. BERTOMEU: He got a horse.

And he take out the horse and bring him home and I stay there to get more, that stuff. SELLES: Like bush, you know. BERTOMEU: To be ready when he comes back, and he can come and get me, you know. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: These animals were yours? SELLES: Yeah. Chickens. SIGRIST: Were they pets, or were they just food, basically? And work, you know, the horse being the . . .

We make . . . SELLES: People, they roast like a little lamb, you know, a baby lamb, or a baby goat, you know. They bring it to the oven where they make the bread. Then you go, every year, let me see, every week, you know, they have an oven there where they make the bread. They make the long bread, and they . . . BERTOMEU: Special ovens. SELLES: A lamb, or a little pig, you know. SIGRIST: So this is like a town oven, a communal oven. SELLES: The one everybody goes and makes the bread there.

But he don't believe in the girls to go to school. He wanted to sent us to sew, you know. In those times. So you'd be a dope, sit that way.

BERTOMEU: So, I don't know. I don't even want to come here, because I don't know. You know, what I know is talk with the people and . . . SIGRIST: Did, was this typical, though, in this town in Spain? Girls, a lot of families didn't allow the girls in the family to have education? SELLES: Oh, yeah, they all go to school, but not us. SIGRIST: Just your family. SELLES: My father was that away. BERTOMEU: She like to show, teach us to sewing more than anything. SELLES: To sew. SIGRIST: Did you have to learn how to sew?

SIGRIST: You said your brother, your brother's fifteen, and he's sent to Cuba, he goes to Cuba. SELLES: No. He went to Cuba when he were eighteen. He wanted to go. And that's why we all, we came with him, because otherwise him alone . . . BERTOMEU: The family started saying if he goes alone maybe he forget yous and this and that, you know.

He say, "Sell everything and come over here with the kids." SELLES: She got two at the time, her and my brother. BERTOMEU: She don't want to go, because she don't want to leave her family, parents and sisters and brothers. She don't want to go. SIGRIST: Her life would have been very different had she gone.

( she laughs ) And a lot of people, it smelled. BERTOMEU: We don't want to go to sleep downstairs because it stink, vomit. SELLES: We sleep upstairs, you know, on the floor. We had a blanket, you know. SIGRIST: So this was not a pleasant trip. BERTOMEU: No. SIGRIST: Were there lots of Spanish people going to Cuba at that time? BOTH: Yes. SIGRIST: What was in Cuba? Why did people want to go to Cuba? SELLES: Who knows? I don't know. BERTOMEU: I wish we come here first, but we can't, you know. We got to wait till the time. SELLES: When we got to Cuba there is no, all of the restaurants, the hotels, they call a fonda, that means a motel, like. But they got food too, you know. Everything was full, nothing. So a family that we knew, you know, we stayed there for a few days in their house. That was nice. SIGRIST: How long did the boat trip take from Spain to Cuba? BOTH: Nineteen days. SIGRIST: That's a long time. BOTH: Yeah. SIGRIST: Where in Spain did you leave from? SELLES: From Coruna, Coruna. SIGRIST: Which is where, roughly? SELLES: It's in the north, too.

SELLES: The cows, you know, there. Yeah, they kill it. A lot of cows. And they kill, you know, every day, some of them, to make the . . . BERTOMEU: The food. SIGRIST: So they actually took livestock on the boat to feed the passengers. SELLES: Right, right. SIGRIST: Did this boat have different classes to travel, or was it just . . . SELLES: First class and second, and third. But third was awful. SIGRIST: That's where you were. SELLES: Yes! SIGRIST: With the vomit. SELLES: Oh, yeah.

SIGRIST: Tell me how your mother reacted to this experience. Was she a good sailor? How did she, uh . . . BOTH: Yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: She didn't get sick, or . . . SELLES: I think we all got sick. I didn't get sick. I was a kid, you know. BERTOMEU: Oh, we got a cousin there. She got a little daughter. SIGRIST: Oh, she gave birth to a child? BERTOMEU: No. She, we came with the two sisters. SELLES: Our cousins. SIGRIST: Your cousins. BERTOMEU: Yeah. And she got a little baby. And she didn't give the breast. And before she went to the boat, she took one can of milk. And my mother said, "Oh, you got to get more milk. That's not enough." So after she started giving the baby all the food, and the baby died on the boat. SELLES: She got diarrhea. BERTOMEU: Diarrhea. SELLES: She was about, let me see, ten months old, maybe eight. BERTOMEU: Yeah, maybe eight months. SELLES: And so, you know, when they, when we came, we got out. We came, you know, out. But they went to, like, some place like this. SIGRIST: Like a medical facility or something. SELLES: Yeah. They call them, which over here is Ellis Island, they call them Triscornio over there. SIGRIST: Oh, that's a terrible story. SELLES: And she died over there, the little kid, you know, the baby, she died. BERTOMEU: And that's what, she killed him, because, you know, that food. SELLES: You know, they give that, diarrhea. SIGRIST: Now, where in Cuba did you land? SELLES: In Havana. BERTOMEU: Havana. SIGRIST: And you said that when you arrived you couldn't get a hotel room. SELLES: No. SIGRIST: So you stayed with a family. SELLES: With a family which, they were very nice. BERTOMEU: A friend's house. SIGRIST: Where did you meet these people? BERTOMEU: Well, they ( acquiesing to her sister ), all right, okay. SELLES: Well, my mother, you know, those people's mother, they told them to, you know . . . BERTOMEU: Go see. SELLES: To go there if we don't find, you know. That's what we did. SIGRIST: And how long did you stay with them? BERTOMEU: Well, my mother and I, we find a job. SIGRIST: Oh, you found a job right off the bat, right when you got there? What did you do? BERTOMEU: Yeah. Because over there, even if they got a little store they got servants. The wife don't do anything in Cuba at that time. They got two or three servants to do the house, the housework. SIGRIST: And so you do this domestic work. BERTOMEU: Yeah, domestic work. SIGRIST: Do you remember the family that you worked for? BERTOMEU: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: What were they like? BERTOMEU: Oh, they were nice. One man, he was in Spain, he was from Spain. And he went to Cuba when he was a young boy. But he don't, he don't do any, any jobs. He don't know. He was too young. And he went back home. ( she laughs ) And the parents, they thought he got a lot of money. But they see they don't have any money, he come back to Cuba. SELLES: He had a deaf mother, you know, that's right. BERTOMEU: He had a deaf mother, come back to Cuba again. So his mother was working over there. And wherever she worked, wherever she stays, you know, I have to stay with her, because she was . . . ( voices garbled ) SIGRIST: Because you're young, younger. SELLES: I didn't work, I didn't work, though. Just stayed with over there. SIGRIST: And, of course, you went to Cuba with the intention to stay in Cuba, so you're trying to set up a life for yourselves. SELLES: Who knows? Maybe with the intention to make money and go back to Spain, you know? BERTOMEU: Yeah, but my brother, he got a nice job in Cuba. SIGRIST: What did he do? BERTOMEU: What did he do in that place? SELLES: He was like a club, you know. SIGRIST: A clerk? SELLES: No, wait a minute. Like a country club, you know. SIGRIST: A country club. SELLES: And he work over there.

Over there you don't do any work. You look like, why don't you?" ( to her sister ) So he come first? BERTOMEU: Yeah. SELLES: He came. BERTOMEU: He came first. SELLES: With the intention to later try to get us here, you know. So that's what happened. SIGRIST: So how long were you in Cuba? SELLES: Four years. BERTOMEU: Four years. SIGRIST: Four years, that's a long time. Did you eventually get your own house or apartment? SELLES: No. BERTOMEU: No. SELLES: No, because domestic work there, you sleep there, you everything. BERTOMEU: You sleep there and eat in there. SELLES: Your own house. In Cuba is no, not like here. SIGRIST: Did your mother dislike Cuba as much as you seem to dislike Cuba? BERTOMEU: I don't know. SELLES: She like here after she came here. SIGRIST: Was your mother a person who expressed how she felt about things, or was she kind of a quiet . . . SELLES: Yeah, quiet. Here was quiet. SIGRIST: So even if she were unhappy you might not necessarily know that. SELLES: No. SIGRIST: What, let me ask Sally, because this is a whole different side to this story, you're a kid in Cuba. Basically you're just that much younger. What did you do all the time? I mean, what did a kid do in Cuba? SELLES: Well, she didn't send me to school. I was in the house with her and with the other, you know, I was in the house. SIGRIST: Were people from Spain looked at as sort of second class citizens in Cuba? Because you were immigrants, to a certain extent. SELLES: Yeah. Oh, you got to, a maid, that's all, a maid, you know. BERTOMEU: Yeah. She don't send them over there. And over there they don't make you to go to school como [like] over here. SIGRIST: Were there lots of wealthy people in Cuba at that time? Were you working for a wealthy person?

SIGRIST: He got another job. BERTOMEU: When Alex got sick, he got married. SELLES: Oh, but that's later. BERTOMEU: That was much later. SELLES: He died, too. SIGRIST: We haven't gotten to that yet. ( he laughs ) Let's get you to America first. So is your brother writing to you while you're in Cuba, and telling you . . . BOTH: Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: What did you guys know about America? SELLES: We know what we hear about America. SIGRIST: What did you hear about America? SELLES: We thought that over here was . . . BERTOMEU: There's a lot of difference after we see it. SELLES: Over here you come and you get money all around. ( she gestures ) ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: Just scoop it right up. ( they laugh ) Did you believe that? BERTOMEU: I find a job, Broadway, over here, you know, sewing ladies' suits and clothes, and even talk Spanish or don't talk Italian and mixed. And it was much more for jobs. It's not so good now, anyway. SIGRIST: Did your brother send you money to leave Cuba with? SELLES: No. BERTOMEU: No. SELLES: No, because, see, in 1921 was a crisis here, and there was no money. ( she laughs ) No, my mother had it. SIGRIST: Of course, you two are working, right, ( to Ms. Bertomeu ) you and your mother, so you do have some money. BERTOMEU: Yeah, yeah. And she send the money to Spain to the kids. SELLES: They were making, uh . . . SIGRIST: Oh, so your mother's sending money back to whoever was taking care of the . . .

SIGRIST: That was a lot of money. SELLES: Twenty-five, thirty. BERTOMEU: I never got a penny. She take right away. I say, "Ma, don't send so much, because they got all the properties we got, you know, to take a lot of food there, and the house." But . . . SIGRIST: They were living better than you were, and you were sending the money to them. BERTOMEU: So after we got them over here . . . SELLES: That's later. SIGRIST: When did you leave Cuba? It was 1923? SELLES: 1923. SIGRIST: What month? Do you remember? SELLES: September. SIGRIST: September 1923. Do you know what boat you took from Cuba to New York? SELLES: Esperanza.

SIGRIST: You knew anything couldn't be worse than where you were from. BERTOMEU: Oh, sure. Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: So you had to sleep overnight on the boat just one night? SELLES: One night, ain't it? BERTOMEU: Yeah. I think one night. SIGRIST: There were three of you, right? There's your mother and you, too. SELLES: That lady was so good. SIGRIST: What lady was that?

BERTOMEU: A little boat. They took us out. SIGRIST: They took you to here, and then what happened when you got here? SELLES: Well, my brother came to the island. And, so I didn't know that we were going to, we weren't going to stay here. So I remember that, well, I was almost fourteen. I started to cry when he left. I want to go with him. And then they all pepped up a little. SIGRIST: That's right. Because you hadn't seen your brother for a while. And they wouldn't let you go. How did your mother react to this? SELLES: Oh, she react good. BERTOMEU: Good, she have patience. SELLES: Maybe they send us back to Cuba, you know. That's what we thought. SIGRIST: What did Ellis Island look like at that time?

Did you see, you didn't have that in Spain probably. SELLES: Oh, not in Spain. SIGRIST: In Cuba you might have seen that stuff. SELLES: Oh, yeah, the rich people yeah. BERTOMEU: Oh, yeah, my God. SELLES: But in Spain we went outside. ( they laugh ) SIGRIST: No toilets there. BERTOMEU: Well, we had a chance to have it, but because my father, when he don't want to do that job any more, he didn't fix the house. SIGRIST: When he was going to fix the house. BERTOMEU: Put a bath. SIGRIST: Modernize it. BERTOMEU: But, like my mother say, that was not for me. SIGRIST: Did, when you first got to Newark, was there a big Spanish population in Newark at that time? BERTOMEU: Yeah. SELLES: Oh, yeah. You hear Spanish people. But a lot speaking in Polish, in German. You hear every language, a lot of languages, yeah. SIGRIST: Was this unusual for you, or surprising to you to see all these different kinds of people that you had never seen before? Because really you're going from Spain to Cuba, which is also Spanish-speaking. SELLES: We had already, you know, knew that, because they taught us over here is immigrants, you know, a lot of people talked a whole lot of languages. SIGRIST: So you sort of expected that. SELLES: Yeah, we expected it. SIGRIST: Well, let me ask Pilar, what was the first job you got in America? BERTOMEU: The first? SELLES: Edison, no? BERTOMEU: Edison. SIGRIST: Edison. BERTOMEU: Edison. And a machine around, and got a little holes, and used to put the holes in there all around, you know, in there. It's for lights, for the bulb. And I'm telling you. I can't see good. And I never like to go to the movies. I never liked it because I can't see the, and I tell my mother, I say, "How come you see the cars so far and I can't see?" And she say, "Because you don't look right." She never told me take me to the doctor. And you know I needed glasses so bad and I hated movies. I hated movies. And I went to, took me to the doctor, "I can't see the movies. I can't see anything." Even the people from across the street, I don't recognize. And a lot of people say, "Oh, she's so stuck, she don't even want to talk." When I got the glasses I said, "Oh, my God." SIGRIST: Did that happen soon after you go to Newark? BERTOMEU: You know, after I got married and I went to the movies with my children, I even say to him, to them, "What does that man got in the nose?" He say, "A moustache?" (?) to have the same trouble like me. SIGRIST: So this job that you got, your first job, it really bothered your eyes to do this? BERTOMEU: Yes, it bothered my eyes. SIGRIST: Was that typical of the people of your mother's generation, to not go to the doctor for things, or was it just something she didn't . . . BERTOMEU: I don't know. Even in Cuba. I told her. That happened to me in Cuba, too. When I come over here, and when I put the glasses, "Oh, my God." I said, "What I lose, so much." SIGRIST: Kind of your Welcome To America present. You can see. ( he laughs ) BERTOMEU: America is the best place to go to, believe me. SIGRIST: Sally, talk to me a little bit about your mother. Tell me what she did when she first got to this country. SELLES: Oh, she, uh, I stay home with her. She went to work, you know. I stayed home. They didn't send me to school. I got shopping, she goes shopping, you know, for food, and I go with her, all that. SIGRIST: So your mother didn't get a job right off the bat. SELLES: No, no, she didn't get a job. SIGRIST: Was your mother kind of frightened by it all? BOTH: No. SELLES: No. BERTOMEU: I got a job because there were a lot of people from Spain, girls, and they make me go to there and I got a job right away, and then in sewing . . . SIGRIST: So you were kind of, kind of the breadwinner of the family. You were bringing home the paychecks. BERTOMEU: Oh, yeah. I never take a penny from there. SIGRIST: And your brother, too. He went with you? SELLES: Yeah. But then after, you know, passed three months, maybe four months, maybe, and I was home. And one day two detectives came home. ( voices garbled ) And they told me, you know. If Monday she's not in school, two hundred fifty dollars fine. And, you know, in those times, two hundred fifty dollars was a lot of money. So that's how I went over here to school. SIGRIST: Sort of forced to, in a way. SELLES: I don't even know how to put my name, how to write my name. BERTOMEU: Even me. I'm older than her. They told me, one time they come into the house and my mother say, "A man was just over here." She say, "You got to go to school in the night." They want you to learn, you know. And you know what my brother say? I don't have to block myself from nothing. He say, "In the night only go the bad girls to school." SIGRIST: So this is the mentality that we're dealing with. This is how they felt about women getting an education. SELLES: Right, right. SIGRIST: Even when he came to this country your brother is still thinking in these Old World sort of ways. BERTOMEU: And in Spain he went to school while my father was alive, and he goes in the day to the school, and then I go to learn French in Spain, my brother. SIGRIST: Well, so did you eventually go to night class? BERTOMEU: This don't go on the record. SIGRIST: Did you go to night classes in Newark? Did you finally? BERTOMEU: No, because he told me don't go. Only bad girls go to school in the night. SIGRIST: That's terrible. Well, Sally, tell me about going to school for those two years. BERTOMEU: So I'm the dope in the family. SELLES: Monday came, my brother took me to school. SIGRIST: Did he feel differently about you going to school because you were younger? SELLES: Well, he feel different because they really forced them to send to school. And . . . BERTOMEU: It's more fair in this country. SELLES: So I went. I didn't know what they were talking about. BERTOMEU: Education is best. SIGRIST: Tell me how you learned English, Sally. BERTOMEU: Well, she went . . . SELLES: I went only two years to school, you know, and I didn't know nothing in Spanish because no numbers, and nothing, almost. And it took me a lot, because they put me in a class with little kids, ABC. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: How did you feel about that? SELLES: It was hard. And I didn't feel like staying there, you know, with the little kids. But then I went to the third grade, you know, third or fourth, which I improve a little, you know. They told me, I used to write my name like that, you know. Like this. ( she gestures ) I write like this, the way I learn. SIGRIST: Do you remember when it all made sense to you? Do you remember that moment when suddenly you understood English? SELLES: Yeah. SIGRIST: I mean, was there a moment where it just kind of clicked on inside of you? SELLES: Yeah. SIGRIST: Do you remember that? Did you help teach your mother English? How did your mother learn, or did she learn? SELLES: Well, I help her to get the American citizen. That's how she brought the other kids from Spain, see, the American citizen. So I tried to, you know, teach them, teach her. SIGRIST: Teach your mother. SELLES: Yeah. SIGRIST: Was that hard? SELLES: Oh, yeah, yeah. SIGRIST: What kinds of things did you have to teach her for her to get her citizenship papers? SELLES: Everything. If they ask, "What's your name?", you know, say, and how they, you know, how many kids you have, when did your husband die, and when you left Spain. Things that they are supposed to ask, you know, all those things. SIGRIST: Did you have to teach her American history, too? Did she have to answer questions about . . . SELLES: Yeah, the American flag, about the senators, representatives. BERTOMEU: Sometimes they, and she goes ( she demonstrates mumbling ) and she doesn't open her mouth. SELLES: I remember when she got the immigrant citizens papers. SIGRIST: Was it hard for her to learn because, I mean, she's so much older, of course. SELLES: Yeah. SIGRIST: Was it hard for her to understand and . . . SELLES: Very hard, very hard. SIGRIST: Did she go outside a lot? Did she have friends outside the home? SELLES: No, she wasn't that kind to. Only in Spanish, you know. SIGRIST: Pilar, let me ask you, how did you learn English? BERTOMEU: By talking with friends. ( they laugh ) SIGRIST: Because you were in, you were in a work situation where other languages are being spoken, right? You probably didn't have to speak English at your job. BERTOMEU: And, like I say, where I work there's a lot of Spanish people and talk only Spanish in the house. If it weren't for my mother, when I got in my grandchild, she talk Spanish to her. And I said, "If I'm today, I don't talk Spanish to my grandchildren for nothing." Because, you know, I got a little granddaughter, she's a doctor, and her husband is a doctor. She's Germany, I mean, national. There was a little Jewish boy, and they played together in the yard next door. That's in Irvington, in Newark. And she talk, and she knows, because my mother, we got to talk Spanish with her, even if we don't want to, we got to talk Spanish with her. She talk Spanish with all the grandchildren, too. And that two boys, that little boy and my granddaughter, she's so cute. They both was Jewish, and the parents, they got a store next door my house, couple of blocks. A nice couple, a young couple. And they was talking. He talk in Jewish, and my daughter talk to my in Spanish. ( she laughs ) Because my mother, everybody got to talk Spanish. SIGRIST: Well, that sounds kind of like being in Newark in 1923. Everyone is talking different languages. BERTOMEU: And I hear sometimes in the yard, and I see those two kids. And she say, "I'm going to mi casa [my house]. Yo me voy a mi casa. [I'm going to my house.]" My granddaughter. And he say in Jewish, he say in Jewish. I'm laughing with those two kids, I'm telling you. SELLES: He talking Spanish, my son. SIGRIST: It's good to know different languages. SELLES: Oh, yeah. BERTOMEU: Oh, sure. SIGRIST: What about your brother? Did he learn English? SELLES: Who? SIGRIST: Your brother. SELLES: Oh, yeah. He died, he died. SIGRIST: Soon after you got here? SELLES: No. He died, let me see, about nine years ago. SIGRIST: Oh, oh. Okay. But he learned English. BOTH: Oh, yeah. BERTOMEU: When you know, and he knows in Spanish, he, I mean, he went to school in Spain when my father was alive. SIGRIST: He was well-educated. SELLES: It's easy to learn the other languages. And when you don't know, it's hard. SIGRIST: And neither of you had the advantage of being in a school situation and having to learn when you were young, so it must have been just that much harder once you got here. SELLES: Sure, sure. BERTOMEU: Sure. SIGRIST: Tell me a little bit about, you said your mother was not terribly religious, but . . . SELLES: No. SIGRIST: Did she become more religious here, because I imagine most of the Spanish people would have been around the church, probably. SELLES: No, she didn't go to church, no. SIGRIST: So that really wasn't part of your life. BERTOMEU: No. You never hear of Jehovah's Witness, about Jehovah's Witness? SIGRIST: Excuse me? Jehovah's Witnesses. SELLES: Jehovah's Witnesses. She became that. SIGRIST: Later on. SELLES: Later, yeah. Oh, yeah, she was. SIGRIST: I see. Well, that's interesting. Well, let me see. When, ( to Ms. Bertomeu ) did you get married soon after you got to America? BERTOMEU: I think a couple of years. SIGRIST: What year did you get married? SELLES: 1925. SIGRIST: Pilar got married in 1925. SELLES: 1925, yeah. SIGRIST: And what was your husband's name? BOTH: Vincent. SIGRIST: Bertomeu. SELLES: Yeah, Bertomeu. SIGRIST: And was he an immigrant, or had he been born in this country. SELLES: Oh, no. He was an immigrant, too. BERTOMEU: And immigrant, too. SIGRIST: Where did he come from? SELLES: From Valencia. SIGRIST: That's interesting. How did you meet your husband? BERTOMEU: Well, I meet him one time in the dance. We was going to the dance, and I meet him. He's nice. And her husband is from Valencia, too, Valencia. SIGRIST: And when did you marry your husband? SELLES: 1933, I think. SIGRIST: And what was his name? SELLES: John. SIGRIST: John Selles. SELLES: John Selles. SIGRIST: So your son is a junior. And he was also from Valencia. SELLES: From Valencia, yes. SIGRIST: How did you meet your husband? SELLES: In the dances. We used to go to Spanish dances a lot. SIGRIST: Was this, were you still in Newark when this happened. SELLES: Yeah, we were in Newark. SIGRIST: Can you tell me a little bit about the Spanish community in Newark? It seems like . . . SELLES: Oh, a lot of Spanish in Newark. BERTOMEU: My daughter, she belonged to a club, the Spanish, in America, too. And the other day they went to, her and her husband, they call . . . SIGRIST: I mean then, in the 1920's, was Newark, the Spanish community very active in Newark and very large? BERTOMEU: Yeah. SIGRIST: Can you talk to me about the dances you used to go to? BERTOMEU: They belonged, the Spanish dances, to this club, they call, uh, Young, uh, La Joventud, como se dice [The Youth, how do you say it?], the Youth Club. SELLES: The Youth Club. BERTOMEU: The Youth Club. SIGRIST: Direct translation. BERTOMEU: So now they all, you know. Not old yet, and they went, I no longer go. They went to the dance. And they, they put some money. And every year they make the reunion. So the other day they went. Her husband's name is Mike, and they sit all together. There's a lot of Americans there, too. And they went to the dancing, and she say, "You know, Ma, Mike, he look better than everybody. Young." ( she laughs ) You know, still they're young. The forties, seventies, something like that. And they enjoy. SIGRIST: But when you were girls. Let's get us back into the 1920's, when you were girls who sponsored these Spanish dances? Who . . . SELLES: The club. It was, they have a club that they call Center Espanol, the Spanish club, so they even got a, so that's, you know, everybody, you pay every month some. SIGRIST: And that's how it worked back then. SELLES: Yeah. Another club, they call it. The Spanish people go there. SIGRIST: And would adults and young people go to these dances, or did they just have young people dances? SELLES: No, everybody. And the old ladies go with the young daughter, you know. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: That's right, chaperons. Did your mother go to these dances with you? SELLES: Yeah, yeah, yeah. BERTOMEU: She used to go. SIGRIST: It was, I suppose, a change for her. BOTH: They make a show, too. SIGRIST: You mean like a performance. SELLES: Yeah. SIGRIST: Did you ever have to perform? SELLES: I did. BERTOMEU: She danced. ( they laugh ) And my brother, too. They was good. He was good, too. SELLES: I was the maid. SIGRIST: You were the maid? SELLES: Maid, yeah. And the, uh, the first, you know . . . BERTOMEU: Actress. SIGRIST: And these were all in Spanish? BERTOMEU: In Spanish, yeah. SIGRIST: So this is really a major way of meeting other Spanish people. BOTH: Yeah. BERTOMEU: Oh, they got a lot, and good actors from New York, too. Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: So what year was it that the rest of your brothers and sisters came over? Do you remember exactly what year it was? BERTOMEU: 1933. SIGRIST: '33 they came over. And tell me a little bit about your mother's life after the whole family was together. SELLES: She was happy, though. Oh, she was happy. BERTOMEU: She was very happy. We all was very happy. My brother took the truck to the boat, to . . . SELLES: Yeah. BERTOMEU: And we see three together. I had my little girl, too. I had my little girl. She was four years old. And she went, my brother with the truck, a couple of friends. SELLES: And even the truck, they got it Mendez, you know, so they recognize it because were small when we . . . BERTOMEU: Maybe they don't recognize them, and three together. And we started calling, my brother started calling. And they looking, and they know, because they got to wait. You know, you can't, you got to wait when you're going to get out. Oh, I was really. My mother, she make so much food. I can't believe it. She was so sick. SIGRIST: But maybe this was kind of your mother's reward for all those years of hardship. SELLES: Yeah, she suffered. SIGRIST: And finally her whole family is together. SELLES: She suffered. SIGRIST: Well, I have a couple final questions to ask you, and one is, your mother never wanted to go back to Spain, did she? BOTH: No. SIGRIST: Did either of you, in your adult life, ever want to go back to Spain? SELLES: She did. SIGRIST: Did you go back? BERTOMEU: Oh, I went three times. SIGRIST: But only to visit. BERTOMEU: I went one time to my place and another time to my husband's, my husband's place. SIGRIST: Did it look different than how you had remembered it? BERTOMEU: Oh, yeah, much different, much better. SIGRIST: Things had gotten better. BERTOMEU: Yeah. SELLES: Oh, she was in Madrid and all these places. SIGRIST: Madrid is nice. SELLES: Not in, where we used to be. ( she laughs ) SIGRIST: With the goats. SELLES: With the goats and the pigs. BERTOMEU: I went with my husband around two times to see his family, and then, well, after he died I didn't go any more. I went with my daughter and her husband, too, to my place. SIGRIST: How did you feel when you saw, when you saw your old house? BERTOMEU: They all look better, and they still live in one house. SIGRIST: But emotionally how did you feel? When you saw the house you grew up in, how did you feel inside? BERTOMEU: Oh, I don't feel anything. I feel happy over here. SIGRIST: Just kind of forget about it. SELLES: She didn't even know where she was. SIGRIST: ( he laughs ) Maybe it's better that way. So are you glad you came to this country? BOTH: Oh, yes. SIGRIST: How do you think your life would have been different if you hadn't come here. BERTOMEU: I love America better than any country. SELLES: I send the kids to school, to college and everything. Over there we couldn't. We got a good family. Big difference. Our kids, they got a better education. SIGRIST: So the education is a really important thing. BOTH: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. SIGRIST: Well, before we close can I entice either or both of you into singing a little Spanish song? SELLES: ( they laugh ) I don't have no voice. SIGRIST: It's okay. Please, just something little into the microphone in Spanish, something your mother sang to you as a child, or something like that. SELLES: Rock-a-bye baby. ( she laughs ) Como le cantado [how did she sing it?]. BERTOMEU: I'm sorry. I have no voice. SELLES: I used to sing. SIGRIST: Just a little something. BOTH: ( they sings ) "Munequita linda, de cabellos de oro, de diente de perla, labios de ruby. Di me si le quieres, como yo te quiero, tanto como entonces, siempre hasta morir." [Pretty doll with hair of gold, teeth like pearls, lips like rubies. Tell me if you love me like I love you always, until we die.] A little bit. ( they laugh ) SELLES: It was our pleasure. SIGRIST: That was really nice, thank you. I want to thank you both for coming out here. This has been a real treat, and you're both delightful. I told you it would be fun. ( they laugh ) BERTOMEU: To my nephew, I say, "I want to kill you." Why you go through this trouble? SELLES: Oh, come on. ( they laugh ) SIGRIST: This is Paul Sigrist signing off with Pilar Bertomeu and Sally Selles on Wednesday, May 19, 1993.
