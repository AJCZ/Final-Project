The other days we had anything that comes along. NASH: How did the people amuse themselves on the boat? PAPPAS: Nothing, just sit down on the deck and nothing else. And look at the ocean. NASH: You said there was a storm on the boat? PAPPAS: Very strong almost all the way. NASH: Were there times you thought you wouldn't make it? PAPPAS: Or else I got sick, seasick many times, but I got through. So... NASH: Did you make any friends on the boat? PAPPAS: Yes. I made friends. Big friends, you know, who come together from the same place where I started. NASH: Tell me what happened when you got off the boat. PAPPAS: When I came off the boat they took me to Ellis Island, New York. They examine me there, my eyes. Sooner they found out my eyes was okay, they let me off and my brother was waiting for me downstairs and took me home. What else you want me to say? Did I say it right? NASH: Yes, you did. What were your first impressions of New York City? PAPPAS: That time I was a young fellow, you know. My impression was very nice.

PAPPAS: Last about five hours. NASH: Was there dancing? PAPPAS: Dancing, music, and all. NASH: Do you remember --I would like to know what the difference was between the different weddings of the different groups like the Greeks. PAPPAS: The Polish wedding, after they finish, ready to go, they sit at the table again to eat a second time. They do. NASH: So it was a very long wedding, a very long banquet? PAPPAS: Oh, short. Not many things as the first ones, and the other ones just almost the same. The food is the same. Sometimes they ate chicken or prime ribs of beef. Do you know what that is? NASH: Yes. PAPPAS: And the rest. All this was in there? NASH: Yes. Were any groups nicer to the waiters than any others? PAPPAS: I found lot of nice people and lot of bad people, very rough. They start trouble every minute, but you have to stand for that. Do you know what I mean? NASH: Yes. PAPPAS: One night we had 150 people, FBI. NASH: The FBI came to the wedding? PAPPAS: No, no, just party. And they got drunk as can be. I was surprised people like that to be -- NASH: So drunk? PAPPAS: Yes. That is true. (break in tape) NASH: Mr. Pappas, why did you go back to Greece to fight in the army? PAPPAS: I went back to fight other people, (?) badly treated. That's because they fight them against the Bulgarians and Turks because they want to come to take Greece over. That is why I went to fight for. NASH: And other--many people too? PAPPAS: Lot of people from over here, they went over to (?). Almost half Greeks while I was in New York (?). NASH: That is very interesting, I didn't know that. So many people cared so much about Greece. PAPPAS: Oh, yes. That time was different, not like today. Today they try to escape. Who is that? NASH: It is Pamela. PAPPAS: Yeah, my niece, my granddaughter, is in Greece. She is about nineteen now, and she telephone from England yesterday. NASH: Really?
