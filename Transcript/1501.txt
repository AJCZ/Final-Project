DALLETT: My name is Nancy Dallett and I'm speaking with Rebecca Santlofer on Thursday, January 31, 1985. We are beginning this interview, which is number 010, at 6:15 PM. Present in the room also is Bob Bielecki, the sound engineer. We are seated in Mrs. Santlofer's living room and we are about to begin the interview with Mrs. Santlofer about her immigration experience from Poland in July of 1920. This is the beginning of side one of tape number one. SOUND ENGINEER: Okay, we're rolling. DALLETT: Can you tell me where and when you were born? SANTLOFER: I was born December the 25th . I'm eighty-five years old. You figure it out. DALLETT: And where were you born? SANTLOFER: In Poland. What else do you want to know? SANTLOFER: The name of the town? SANTLOFER: Ostrow. DALLETT: Ostrow. Would you know how to spell that? SANTLOFER: O-S-T-R-O-W. DALLETT: Ah, tell me how large was your family. SANTLOFER: My family we were five children. DALLETT: And where were you in that lineup in terms of age of the other four children. SANTLOFER: The other four, my older sister was eleven years old and I was seven months old when my father passed away. My mother was left alone, in Europe. And, of course, she had a hard time bringing us up. She was a Hebrew teacher. And she tried to make a living and send us to school, each and every child. When the children got older each one went their own way and I remained with my mother. Then my two sisters, are you interested in that? DALLETT: Yes. SANTLOFER: My two older sisters, not the, an uncle of them in Chicago brought them over. And then another sister of mine got married and her husband was supposed to go to service so he went to America and then he took her over. We had one brother. So he was supposed to go to service. My mother borrowed money and sent them to America. So I was left with Mama. I went to school with my husband. We were childhood, friends, we didn't know what sweetheart meant. And we went to Hebrew school together and to public school. And then when I wasn't quite sixteen we got married because my mother said it's not nice to go around with a boy being connected. And before you knew, that's life. I had a child, and the war broke out, the first World War, and we lost our family. We didn't know where they were. We couldn't get connected with them, in touch with any of them in America, everything was. Finally one day I got the paper, The Jewish Day, in Europe. I used to read the Jewish paper. And I found that my sisters, my sisters are looking for a mother and daughter. They didn't know that I was married. So, of course, we got in touch through the HIAS with them and that's how our journey started. Meanwhile I had another child and we started to make our passports. And they wouldn't let my husband out of Poland because he was of age that time. They pulled in the eighteen hundred, the eighteen, when you were eighteen years old they pulled them in. So we tried for when you were eighteen years old, they pulled him in. So we tried for money to buy him out and we made passports. I hate to say it, through graft. And we started out to this country. It took us three months, our voyage. We were fourteen days on the boat. And finally, of course my mother was with me, I wouldn't leave mama behind. Finally we arrived to this country and my family came to take us and they said that there's a sickness on the boat and we wouldn't be able to get off, they should, it's no sense for them staying there, they should go and come tomorrow and see what's going to be done. So then I had two little kids and an old mother ( she laughs ) and we didn't know what the devil to do. So one man came over to us and says, "You know, if you want to go into the country we'll let you but your mother must stay here until your brother comes and signs for her." Because my family went home. So I started to cry. I wouldn't leave my mother. He says, "Listen, you have two little children. Believe me." He spoke to me in Jewish. "Believe me, if I tell you everything is going to be all right you just tell your brother to come tomorrow and sign for your mother." So that's what we did, we came to my older sister. It was funny. We get off the boat and I says to my husband, "You know, Phil, they say they're all thieves here. If you get a cab maybe it wouldn't be the right, maybe they'll rob us." We had two hundred and sixty-five dollars with us, don't forget. So, ah, he says, "Don't worry, we'll take that chance." We came to my sister, she looks at us like we're crazy, "What are you doing here? Mama is not here?" I says, "Our brother should go for her tomorrow morning." Well, then that next morning my brother came and signed for my mother, and she came. And they started like this, my sister, "stay here with us fora while. We'll teach your husband a trade. And maybe you wouldn't have to struggle the way we did." I said to my sister, "No. If I have on board I want it for myself." I started house hunting. And in 1920 it was almost as bad as now. So finally I got an apartment downtown on Houston Street. Three rooms, you shouldn't know from it, with one window, and the john in the hall, cold water. And a walk-up, and I have two little children. But to me, I made the best of it. I come back to my sister and I say, "I've found an apartment." And where, what, and I showed her. I see my mother sittin' in the corner, this is very important for you people, and she's crying like she lost her last friend. I says, "Mama, what did they do to you? Did they insult you? What happened?" She says, "No." "Aren't they good to you?" She says, "Yes." So why are you crying?" She says to me, "Why are you leaving me?" I says, "But Mother, I have nothing to offer you. I have two, three little rooms like one. We are four people, two children, my husband and I. You wouldn't be comfortable." She says, "Darling, do me a favor. But a chair in the corner. I don't need a bed, and I want to be with you." I cried when I heard. I says, "Mother, you don't have to worry." I tell you something, my husband and I slept on a folding bed and I gave my mother the bedroom for a whole year until I could afford another apartment, yeah. DALLETT: If you don't mind, let's go back a bit in time. Uh, okay, you're still young and your sisters have come over. Your sisters came over before your brother? SANTLOFER: Way before, yeah. DALLETT: Did they come together? SANTLOFER: No, each one separate. DALLETT: No, one at a time. So, do you remember sending off each of your sisters and your brother? SANTLOFER: No. DALLETT: No, you were too young. SANTLOFER: Only my brother I remember. DALLETT: Your brother, you do remember. Uh, do you, you must have been told stories or do you remember the circumstances or what year it was that your sis, your first sister came? SANTLOFER: I can't tell you that. Because I was very young. Trouble we had, I know, but I was young. DALLETT: But you . . . SANTLOFER: I remember them leaving. DALLETT: You do remember them leaving? SANTLOFER: Yeah, that I cried, that's all. DALLETT: And once they got to America, uh . . . SANTLOFER: They used to write to us and send us a little money. But, like I said, when the war broke out we lost them. We didn't hear from them until that time that I told you that I saw them, the name in the paper. And that's the story so far. DALLETT: Okay, at this point your two sisters and your brother have left and you're alone with your mother, uh, how did you make that decision that it was time for you, well before you found the advertisement looking for you in the paper had you planned . . . SANTLOFER: It didn't dawn on us. DALLETT: . . . to come to America? SANTLOFER: It didn't dawn on us. Because Hitler took over Poland that time. It wasn't Hitler, it was the Germans. And they were just as bad. And you weren't sure with your life. But you know, we were young and ambitious. We used to deal with things. We used to buy wheat and bring up to the meal and make flour and a little to the bakers and that's how we made a living. In fact, I made cigarettes and sold them to the, the neighborhood. In Europe I'm talking about. There wasn't a thing that we didn't do to support ourselves. But we never dreamt that we would come to this country until I found my family and then we got papers from them and we started out. But it was, it was a rough situation, believe me. DALLETT: So it wasn't like you spent a long time dreaming about coming to America or thinking about that? SANTLOFER: No, no, I didn't, no. DALLETT: You were just living your life, carrying on . . . SANTLOFER: From day to day, whatever will happen will happen. DALLETT: And you read this, you read this advertisement in the paper and . . . SANTLOFER: In the paper and I ran to my mother and I said, "Mama, I found them." And my mother didn't know what I find. So this is how I came to this country, and of course there was hardship because I knew, I was, I found out I'm having another child. And, uh, so we got another apartment. I went out, while I was downtown I used to buy, I was very handy with the needle. I used to buy pieces of material and make skirts, different sizes and sell them in the neighborhood to the people to try and help out to make a living. Shall I go on? DALLETT: Sure, uh-huh. SANTLOFER: We were two years in this country and we went to business. We opened a cleaning store, in the Bronx, and we lost out. So that didn't, that didn't scare us. We started all over again and a friend of my brothers lived in in Whitestone here and he belonged to the Odd Fellows. My brother was a "Past Noble Grant." So we were invited to an open meeting, they took us. And I met that man and he felt sorry for us. He says, "In College Point." You don't know where that is, no t far from here. "In College Point there's a place that nobody can stay in the business. I'm sure that your sister and brother-in-law will make out. We did. We bought the store for one hundred dollars. And we started out, I'll, I'll never forget it, in June. I was sitting outside on a chair and I made believe I read the paper. And when I saw somebody going by with a bundle of work I picked up my head and I says, "We are new people, how about giving us a break?" And believe me, when they came in they had no reason to go away from us. We tried our best. But it's all right if there's a season and a slow time, so my husband and I was thinking what else can we do. So we moved our place. There was a sidestreet to the main street in College Point and I says, "You know, that place, this place is only factories in College Point, a lot of working people. How about buying second hand clothes?" We tried it out and I'll tell you, we made money. U wouldn't be the way I am now if not this. When we got through with that I had a cousin, it was in the trimming business. I went over to him and I says, "Jack, I need open doors." "What do you want now?" I said, "I want to buy dresses, job lots." I bought, I don't know, I guess you understand what I mean. The Gentiles is a beautiful thing to deal with, the Jews it's good to go to, to temple. So, I told the people that I don't charge them for alterations, and we, we cleaned up on that. Then we took in men's clothes. We made a regular department store out of our store. DALLETT: Had you done work like this before you came to America? SANTLOFER: No, that was my hobby, sewing. I used to make dolls dresses and then I made for myself a dress, and then I couldn't afford more than one piece of material so if I had another, another place to go to in Europe. I took off the flower and I put on a ball here for a different dress. I was crazy about clothes. So I had an idea and that's what put us on our feet. DALLETT: And did, what did your husband do when he was young, when he was eighteen, before you left the country? SANTLOFER: He was an only son. He went to school, but then he started to take up a little tailoring, but he didn't like it. He never liked that. But here we couldn't help it. We worked together. I was twenty-one years in one store in College Point with my husband together. The children grew up there, went to school there. DALLETT: Okay. I don't mean to interrupt this story, I want to hear all these details. I just want to make sure we go back to the beginning a bit. I'm still curious about the point where you're still in Poland and you've had this letter, well, you've read the advertisement. And, uh, you're about to make this decision to move. Um, how long a process was that? How long did it take you from the time you knew you were going to go the States? DALLETT: It took us, it took us three months. DALLETT: No, I mean to make that decision and to . . . SANTLOFER: To make the decision, as soon as we got the papers we went to the HIAS and they got in touch with my family and they sent us papers. As soon as the papers came we started to make passports. Which was, well, for my husband the passport, it wasn't easy. They wouldn't let him out. But he got it and we started out. DALLETT: Did you know a lot of other people who were doing that at the time you knew you were going to go to the States? DALLETT: It took us, it took us three months. DALLETT: No, I mean to make that decision and to . . . SANTLOFER: To make the decision as soon as we got the papers we went to the HIAS and they got in touch with my family and they sent us papers. As soon as the paper came we started to make passports. Which was, well, for my husband the passport, it wasn't easy. They wouldn't let him out. But he got it and we started out. DALLETT: Did you know a lot of other people who were doing that at the time so you knew how to go about it? SANTLOFER: No, darling. DALLETT: How did you even know where to go to get that information? SANTLOFER: You know trouble teaches you a lot. If you have a lot of trouble in your life, if your life isn't easy, it's better than a college, believe me. You get a good education. And we were always on the go. We, we, I used to make those, take the cigarettes and go to Warsaw and sell them. We were straight business people. DALLETT: And so did it fall to you or did your husband sort out how to get that passport for himself or . . . SANTLOFER: He wasn't allowed. DALLETT: No. SANTLOFER: It was my mother and I. DALLETT: So you and your mother sorted that out. SANTLOFER: Because when we started to go to this country, on the, on the train they took off young men, you know, from the train, back to Poland to the service. My husband let himself grow a beard and had a big raincoat on and my poor mother held the two children in, one in an apron and one near her. And she was praying to God to let him go through. DALLETT: So where is it you took a train from/to when you, all right, you're about to leave . . . SANTLOFER: From Warsaw there is a station there that, not in Warsaw, near Warsaw, there's a station that the trains come. We went to Danzig. And from there we were, they kept us there fourteen days in Danzig because they knew that I have money from America, believe it or not, so they keep you. DALLETT: How did they know that? SANTLOFER: They know because you can't hide the money because you put it in the bank there, in their bank. So, when I saw the money's going and they don't do anything for me, so a young man came from different part, you know, different organization, they have some many. And they, he felt sorry for us. So he says, "If you can get a pass, get with me to the city." Wherever it was. "I can, I can take the money out from here and put it, you'll sign for it, and I'll see that you get transportation." So from there they took us to Antwerpen, where the boat would leave. And that's through that young man we got on the boat and that's how we . . . DALLETT: And that's how you learned the ropes. SANTLOFER: You have to, you ask. That's an awful long thing . . . DALLETT: Do you actually remember getting on the boat? SANTLOFER: Of course, of course. I went sightseeing in the afternoon before the boat started. But, uh, and then my mother was kosher, she wouldn't eat anything on the boat. So all her eating was bread and herring, because otherwise it wasn't kosher enough for her. Well, I kept a strictly kosher house when I had my mother, not now. Because I loved my mother very much. She was my mother and father. She was a great person. So what else do you want to know? DALLETT: Okay, so now we're at the point where you're gonna get on the boat. You're leaving Poland. SANTLOFER: So I'm on the boat. Third class, we came, of course, because it's cheaper. DALLETT: How much was it? Do you remember? SANTLOFER: I don't. You want too much. I don't remember that much. ( she laughs ) Don't forget it's sixty-five years. I only know that it took us fourteen days on the boat till we came to this country. DALLETT: And the exit port where you left from was? SANTLOFER: Antwerpen. You want to know the name of the boat? DALLETT: Do you remember that? SANTLOFER: Finland. DALLETT: Finland. SANTLOFER: Yeah, things like that you can't forget. DALLETT: Tell me what you remember about the crossing. Tell me about those fourteen days. SANTLOFER: The fourteen days was bad because my mother didn't feel good. I didn't feel good, you know, the voyage, the only one that was healthy was my oldest son and my husband. They ate everything. We didn't. DALLETT: How old was your oldest son then? SANTLOFER: My oldest son was three years old and my second son was nine months. Jonathan's father was nine months old. DALLETT: So you were in third class and what did that mean? SANTLOFER: That meant that the first class is good, that people get the best of everything and they get waited on, and the second is a little lower and the third is what's ever left over. DALLETT: Sleeping accommodations, what was that like? SANTLOFER: Are you kidding? We had one little cabin for all of us. For four, five people, my mother, the two kids, and my husband and I, in one cabin. DALLETT: How large would that cabin be? SANTLOFER: Smaller than this room, much smaller, maybe like my dining area, maybe. DALLETT: With a pull-down bed or how did that work? SANTLOFER: No, it was one you had to go up on a ladder. One up and one down. What can I tell you? ( she laughs ) I tell you the truth. It's good those things, you know that they say, it's good those things happened when I was young. You can take things when you're young. DALLETT: How did your mother handle that kind of . . . SANTLOFER: My mother, my mother, I think, I used to say that the old, the real old generation were iron. She took care of everything. And you think I could manage to go, to go to business with my mother, if not for my mother? She used to bake and cook and take care of the children. That's how we tried to make a living. DALLETT: Do, did you associate with other people on the boat or did you pretty much stay in your cabin or did you know anyone else before you got on the boat who was coming at that time? SANTLOFER: No, not a soul. We met people there, like in our, the same story as us. But I didn't, I didn't have enough time for that. The truth, I was so involved with my family, you know, that nobody bothered, I didn't bother with anybody, but when we came here. We tried, we, ah. DALLETT: There wasn't like a place where the kids could, uh, where your three-year-old could play with some other children? SANTLOFER: Are you, are you kidding? DALLETT: You just were in charge the whole time. SANTLOFER: They held on to my skirt or my mother's apron. And the little one, of course, the nine month old was in my arms. DALLETT: Did your mother have reservations about wanting to stay in the country or was she sure she would come? SANTLOFER: She didn't want it, we could have come before the World War started, but she says it's not kosher here. She was very religious because she came out from a rabbinical family. And I used to say, "Mother, wherever you are you can lie your own life, you don't have to live like other people." But after we went through so much trouble and we found out family she said to me, "You know, my child, I'm sorry I didn't go with you when you asked me to." And I wouldn't go without my mother. I wouldn't leave her. DALLETT: Why did she think that she couldn't lead, live the kosher style when she came here? Did she get letters? SANTLOFER: Honey, no. Old-fashioned way they had it in their mind that America is, is not kosher. DALLETT: Right. She had heard about the reform movement/ SANTLOFER: That's it, that's it, and she couldn't see it. DALLETT: No. Did you have feelings about that, too, were you religious? SANTLOFER: Well, I'll tell you, I was more on the modern side. I always, I was young but I always associated with older friends than me. Because I figured I'd learn from them more. And, uh, to me, I figure if you're good, you did good to people, that's enough. And my mother couldn't see it, well, I wouldn't tell that to my mother, because, like I said, when she was at my house everything was strictly kosher. So, and then my mother passed away and I'm not a hypocrite. I was in business, I tore paper, I wrote up the receipts, I took money, and you're not supposed to do that on Saturday. So you see, it's a different life. When my mother passed away I gave all that up. I am not, I don't take in ham or so because I don't care for it, but if I go out with the children . . . I went out with Edith, you know Edith, and she says, "Mom, what are you going to have?" I said, "A bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich." So, I feel, I look at life a little different. DALLETT: How about your older sisters and your brother? Were they strictly kosher? SANTLOFER: No, none of them, that's why my mother wouldn't stay with it. None of them had kosher homes. DALLETT: So that fell to you. SANTLOFER: My, I remember, I remember my older . . . DALLETT: How did she manage then on the boat while she ate her herring or . . . SANTLOFER: Just, just bread and herring, that was her, and tea, that was her food. DALLETT: For fourteen days. SANTLOFER: That's right. And she held out beautifully. She only was afraid of me because I was very thin. Now I'm bigger, according to than I was, I weighed eighty-nine pounds when I had my three kids. ( she laughs ) And Mama was always afraid. Look, nothing happens, if you have years to live, leave, and you make up your mind that that is your life and you have to take it this way . . . DALLETT: How about your husband, how did he fare on the journey? SANTLOFER: He was healthy, he ate everything. Him and my older son. I looked to them and I almost didn't, you know what I mean. DALLETT: Did he have family that had come here as well? SANTLOFER: No. DALLETT: He was the only son, I'm sorry, you said that. SANTLOFER: He was one son, he had two sisters. So one remained in Europe and the other one Hitler killed him when Hitler came in after, you know, in '30, you know, and killed my father-in-law. My mother-in-law died before, I mean after we left, but my father-in-law and my sister-in-law and her husband and the little girl was killed by Hitler. And he has the only sister that remained is now in Israel. DALLETT: So he didn't have reservations about coming to this country when . . . SANTLOFER: No, no, but he was like this, "Where you go, I go, we all go together or we stay here together." We had, didn't have a rich life, but we had a happy life. DALLETT: Okay, so, you've had your fourteen days on board, and did you have any idea how long it was going to take, did you have people tell you in letters how long to expect or anything like that? SANTLOFER: Nope, nope. We take everything, every day the way it came. That's how it was. And the same thing as when we were in this country. DALLETT: Tell me about when you docked and came through the harbor and . . . SANTLOFER: I just, I told you before, that man that told me to go and we took the cab and came to my sister. DALLETT: How about when you initially, first when you came into Ellis Island, you got the ferry and . . . SANTLOFER: And I looked, and I looked at the Statue of Liberty I just, if I could reach I would kiss her, you know. Because whatever hardship we had here doesn't compare to Europe. It's a different life entirely. See, people don't realize that here they have every opportunity in the world. Which in Europe you haven't got it. I went to school on account of my uncle had property, a taxpayer, otherwise you're, you're not entitled to school. It's a very rough life there. So . . . DALLETT: And you were conscious when you came in at that age, knowing that she really represented, you were in a new country with new possibilities. SANTLOFER: That's right, and I loved it. We were about a couple of days here, we came on a Tuesday, and Friday we went to Brooklyn to visit my husband's aunt and my sister was scared stiff. We won't make it. We made it. You write down the address and you make it. Lot of things. DALLETT: So it was a Tuesday that you, that you came into the harbor. SANTLOFER: On a Tuesday, yes. DALLETT: And, tell me about coming into Ellis, coming into the building. SANTLOFER: To the building, it was a building, a huge building. People, for the world. This one cried. This one, he laughed, you know. This was one, was held back because they, they examined your eyes and everything else, you know. DALLETT: Tell me about that process. Did they split you up or were you all together with your family? SANTLOFER: Not my family, they didn't. The only one they took back was my mother because on account of my brother had to come and sign for her. Other we were together. DALLETT: So you went through your eye examinations at the same time. SANTLOFER: And I'll tell you something else. You'll always find if it's in a strange country or whatever, you'll find people that are decent. People helped us out and advised us. Don't go this way, go that way, you know what I mean. DALLETT: No officials, just people who would . . . SANTLOFER: No, plain people there. Wherever there were there, I don't know, but somehow they felt, felt sorry for us, you see people with little children, you know. And we were dressed very nice because we make our own clothes, you know. And the children, too. And my mother was like a princess, she looked. And, uh, so people were very nice to us, they advised us what to do. And when I, when we came off there was nothing else, nobody was, in fact, my sisters wanted, when my mother was with me and I had hard times my sisters wanted to help me out financially because my mother was with me, I says, "You better get out of here. for my mother you're gonna pay me?" I wouldn't take it. Mrs. Big Shot, you know? DALLETT: Do you remember them actually examining the children or examining your husband? SANTLOFER: Yeah, yeah, doctors, yeah. They took each one in a room. DALLETT: Separately? SANTLOFER: Separate, but only I could go with the children together because on account they were too young, you know, so I was very happy because I cried, "Let me be with my kids," and only me and the children. DALLETT: So normally they wouldn't let you in . . . SANTLOFER: I don't think so, I can't tell you exactly if they would or not, but when I start to beg, you know, that I would love to be with my children, that they'll get scared, they'll cry, and it, you, it'll be easier for you to examine them when I'm with them, so I was with the children, my husband separate, of course, and my mother separate. But after that it was . . . DALLETT: So they just sailed through the medical exam, and you did and your husband did. SANTLOFER: Yeah. DALLETT: That's the end, that's the end of Side A of Tape One of Interview 010. END OF SIDE ONE, TAPE ONE BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO, TAPE ONE DALLETT: This is the beginning of side B of tape one. Okay, so where we now, um, we've landed and you've gone through your medical examination, uh, what language were all the officials speaking to you in? How did you understand them? SANTLOFER: They spoke to me in Jewish. There were people that if they didn't speak Jewish they were translators. But this gentleman that told us to go, not to worry about my mother, he was . . . DALLETT: Where did he come from? SANTLOFER: He was there, he must have been some kind of official, I don't know, really. But he was marching around there, and looking, and, uh, you know, trying to help people. DALLETT: Right. And it was after what point that he said your mother was gonna have to stay? SANTLOFER: When they put my mother in a separate room. The ones that remained remained, were put in a separate room. DALLETT: And why was it she put it in the other room? SANTLOFER: Because she couldn't, she couldn't land. My brother wasn't there to sign for her, I told you. That's why. And they told, so this man came, and I said, and I started to cry. I wouldn't go without my mother, so. DALLETT: So it wasn't a medical reason. SANTLOFER: No, no. My mother was healthy. And, uh, when this man said to me, "It's foolish of you to stay here." So I figured he was right. DALLETT: Why was it that they would hold her back without your brother vouching for her and they would let you come through? SANTLOFER: Because we were a family. We had a little money on us. I told you, that's why. A family they let through and we had an address to my family to go to. We showed them where we going to. And, and my family that were there the day before left the telephone number and the address from them for us. DALLETT: They thought you would be landing the day before? SANTLOFER: That's why they came there but, uh, they heard that some kind of a something is wrong on the boat, some sickness which turned out to be nothing. So that's why we remained there over night. And then they told me that we can go, and my mother remained another day. DALLETT: Okay. So tell me about what it was like that one night that you stayed. SANTLOFER: It wasn't good. ( she laughs ) I don't even remember. I think we were sitting all night, all of us. So it's . . . DALLETT: You don't remember eating? At that point did they feed you, or . . . SANTLOFER: Oh, come on, it's, it wasn't important to us. The important thing to us was to come in here and try and make a living for ourselves. DALLETT: But you didn't have fear that you wouldn't actually get in because that man told you and you believed that . . . SANTLOFER: No, no, I wasn't afraid at all. Because in general I'm not, I'm not a frightened one. DALLETT: Okay. So next day you're met, were you met by your sister? SANTLOFER: We went by ourselves, we took a cab, I told you. DALLETT: Oh, that's right, okay. SANTLOFER: We took a cab and we went to my sisters, she got, she looks at us like crazy. Foreigners. They come and they came in a cab. Because you couldn't walk anyway, it was . . . DALLETT: Where did she live? SANTLOFER: She lived on Seventh Street, downtown. Between First and Second Avenue. She had a big apartment, seven rooms. I came in. I thought she, I thought it's a palace. But that's what she wanted me to stay with her. And then she wanted my mother to stay with her, but my mama wouldn't stay there. DALLETT: So once your mother joined you, you only stayed there until you found your . . . SANTLOFER: Tell we saved a few dollars. DALLETT: How did you manage to do that. What did you do initially? SANTLOFER: Initially? DALLETT: Yeah. SANTLOFER: My husband found a job. He had three jobs. Whatever somebody told him to do he did. And I bought material, I told you, and I made skirts and sold in the neighborhood. And, uh, we made a living. DALLETT: How about your other sister? Where was she living at that time when you arrived? SANTLOFER: I had, I had three sisters, we were three sisters, besides me, we were four sisters. Each one lived in a different place. One lived in South America, but when we came she came back here. DALLETT: Oh, so she wasn't living in New York when you, when you arrived at the other one. SANTLOFER: No. Then, no, then she came here because she wanted to be with the family. DALLETT: And was your brother in, in this country? SANTLOFER: My brother was here, yes, my brother was, uh, I don't know where he was living, he was single, but, uh, he had a nice apartment and he did, did pretty well. DALLETT: And could they help your husband to find some work right off or . . . SANTLOFER: There was an, an uncle that tried, and he tried a lot by himself, he was very ambitious. We tried ourselves. The truth of the matter, I'll tell you, is nobody helped us at all. DALLETT: No kind of aid societies, nothing like that came? SANTLOFER: No, ma'am. There was, there was an uncle in Newark. He's dead now, but I'm sorry, he would be two hundred years old, and my father's brother, very wealthy, in Newark. So my father-in-law wrote to him, this is my only son, please help him out. He was filthy rich. They had some, such a big business. He had an inn and a store to just dust off the things they paid him fifty dollars a week. If he would do it to us we would be in heaven. So he came to see us, to my sister. And the sister and me. "Gee whiz, you look like a kid yourself. Come, I'll buy you a dress." I says, "Uncle, I don't need a dress. My husband needs a job. A dress I can make on my own." So what do you think, I didn't get a dress and I didn't get a job. Yes, yes, my friend. But, uh . . . DALLETT: Did you ever think about living anywhere else besides New York? Did you think about moving somewhere else? Or you knew you were going to come and live in New York City? SANTLOFER: No, no, I wasn't going to live in New York. I came to, you can imagine we came in 1920, we were in a business already, and we lost out, and in 1926 we came to College Point and there we remained. Beautiful town. DALLETT: What was it like when you, when you moved? SANTLOFER: To College Point? SANTLOFER: Yeah, tell me about the neighborhood. DALLETT: ( she laughs ) You know, one house from the other was about two blocks. Otherwise it was shrubs, cows. The ferry would go from there to Pleasant Point across to the Bronx. And it was, mostly it was there factories. And it, wasn't it nice to live there, you know it was a handful of Jews. But those handful we became very close friends. And, uh, we started to go into the church to their affairs. If they had a card party we went to it then, or other things, so you see we became very friendly. And we were there twenty- one years in business. DALLETT: How did your mother adjust originally when you first moved out there? SANTLOFER: She didn't mind because we had built a little Temple, you know. We the Jews, when we came there. In fact, the Temple, I'm a charter member there. Now I don't go because they meet at nights, but I get the minutes every time from there and they ask me if I want they would pick me up to go to a meeting. The first three bricks is my first three sons initials on them. (?) It was nice. And my husband was a learned man, so he used to be the cantor, we couldn't afford our cantor. And we had a good time of it at College Point, it was great. Life changed for us when we came to College Point. And then of course in 1937, '39, my mother passed away. She was eighty-six and when I lost my mother I felt I lost a lot. But you feel you can't live forever. I tell my children that, too. My kids think I'm sixteen years old. DALLETT: How old were your kids then, when your mother died? SANTLOFER: Well, my, my youngest son was bar mitzvahed, my mother was still at the bar mitzvah. He must have been around fourteen, fifteen years old. DALLETT: And your older son was eighteen by then. SANTLOFER: Sure, they all remember her. If you talk to Lou, to Jonathan's father, he says there was nothing like her. DALLETT: So you didn't have any, you didn't have any question about settling, moving to any other major city or moving west or anything. SANTLOFER: No, no, I loved country life. In College Point it was like a country. We lived there from 1926 till 1954. 1954 we bought this co-op. We sold the house there, we bought a house, and we sold it and we bought a co-op. And this, we were here a few years together. In 196-, '65, my husband retired. We went for a trip. We went to Israel, we went to Paris, we went to London. And in 1967 he was gone. It just, we came from a dinner we had with the children and he came up the house and he closed his eyes and that's it. It's gonna be eighteen years. I didn't think I'd last without him that long. But, you've got to, you've got to make up your mind that this is your life. You can't lay down with him. It's something that's impossible. But we were very well liked here, too. Now I belong to a lot of organizations. I belong to, I'm life member of Hadassah, a life member of the Red (?). Do you know what the (?) means? DALLETT: No. SANTLOFER: The Jewish Red Cross. I'm a charter member in the synagogue in College Point. I'm on the Board of the Sisterhood here on (?) Street, and I'm a (?) in the Rebecca Lodge. It keeps, if I'm only well enough to go they come and take me now since I don't feel too good. I have friends that come that driver, come and take me and bring me back home. I don't sit home. I belong to Sholom A'Lechaim, you know that, that place, you know what that means? Sholom A L'Chaim was (?). We used to write books, and we had a club that meetings are conducted in Jewish only. DALLETT: Tell me about how you, how you learned English then. How did you learn English? SANTLOFER: This ( she laughs ) is a story really. When I lived downtown yet, I read the paper, you see, back home I learned Russian, Polish, Hebrew and German. Four languages. I came here and I knew nothing. Because the translation is so much different, but the German lettering is the same. You only have to read it different. So I used to, I didn't take any books, only the paper. I read to find if I understood it. And if not, I asked. So, I see on top it says "Schools for Foreigners with Children." I understood what that meant, that was on Third Street between First and Second Avenue they had a Hebrew school there that the children used to come from public school, three o'clock there, but from one to three they gave you lessons. So one half of the building was for the children, somebody took care of them, and the adults got the other half of the building, and believe it or not I got a book, a present, a gift I'm entitled to my citizenship without questions. I was so eager to learn. And I went to school. DALLETT: Now what was that, you got something in the mail? SANTLOFER: No, from the class, from my class. I got a gift, a book, that was written underneath I'm entitled to my citizenship without questions. But then I moved from there. I moved to Brooklyn. And I went into. I had three kids already. I went into Roebling Street, there was a school, I went into, into the office and I said to one of them, I says, "I'd like to learn how." I says, "Do me a favor, give me a class in the afternoon somehow because I can't go at night." My husband went to night school then. Someone had to be home. So she says to me, "If you can get me twenty women," that was the principal, "I'll make you a class." Honestly, I went out canvassing and I got them in the neighborhood. And the poor guy, the one that, the handyman, when he saw me with the carriage he was so sorry for me that he pulled in the carriage for me and that's how I learned. And then by books. I read a lot. I have a library. I read an awful lot. And I, I can't be a bookkeeper, I can't, uh, but I can write my own letters. I read, write. DALLETT: And then your children just grew yo learning English in the public schools. SANTLOFER: You know what i used to tell to them when they went to school? "If I say something wrong please correct me. I wouldn't be mad at you." DALLETT: So they learned strictly English, and you didn't teach them other languages? SANTLOFER: Well, no, while my mother was in the house they used to, sometimes they understand, speaking Yiddish to them, but other than that I always, even when my mother was here, I spoke to the kids in English because I wanted to learn. DALLETT: And did your mother continue to speak only Yiddish, or did she . . . SANTLOFER: No, my mother, my mother learned English too. She went to night school. DALLETT: She went, too. Tell me, um, I know you weren't there that long, on 7th Street, when you lived with your sister when you first came. SANTLOFER: I was there just a week. DALLETT: Yeah, do you remember that. SANTLOFER: I couldn't wait to get into my own place. DALLETT: Yeah, and your first place was where. SANTLOFER: My sister, for my sister. DALLETT: After your sister, I mean. SANTLOFER: In Houston Street, I told you I got the three rooms. ( she laughs ) DALLETT: And were you in a neighborhood that was surrounded by other people who were just coming to this country and finding their own way? SANTLOFER: No, but believe it or not they were in this country and they didn't speak English. When I moved into Houston Street I said to the neighbor next door, she was Jewish, I says to her "Do me a favor and tell the milkman to leave me milk for the children." I told her in Jewish. She says, "You think I know how to speak English?" So I felt good, you know. Where there's a will, there's a way. DALLETT: So how did you manage in the beginning like that? SANTLOFER: You would be surprised. Because the milkman understood Jewish. The iceman understood Jewish. The coal man understood Jewish. You, you spoke into it a word of English. It's hard, but if you want, you manage. DALLETT: And your husband had to manage because he was finding work at that point. SANTLOFER: That's right. It was a rough life. DALLETT: And, uh, your mother, at that point, let's see, you had to keep the kosher home for your mother then. SANTLOFER: Oh, yes, strictly. DALLETT: And did she find a temple? Was that one of the first things she wanted to do? SANTLOFER: Yes, yes. She used to go three times. Morning prayers, and then there is afternoon prayers. And evening prayers when the stars come out. We didn't deprive her of that. She could do because that was her pleasure. There, yes. DALLETT: So she found one in the neighborhood . . . SANTLOFER: And then when we came, of course, when we came to College Point she surely got because we built up little temple and she was in heaven because her baby's affiliated with the temple. DALLETT: Have you ever been back to Ellis Island? SANTLOFER: No. Once we went to go to the Statue of Liberty, my husband and I. We went there. For a trip, just, for pleasure. But other than that, I don't want to go to Poland. I don't want to go to Ellis Island. I had enough of that. But, you know . . . DALLETT: Did your children grow up with stories of, were they aware of what you had gone through to come to this country? SANTLOFER: No, no, no, I never, I never, in fact Johnnie found out, you know my Lou, his father, has a beautiful home on the island, with a pool. So I was sitting once on the chaise lounge, you know, and I was talking to my granddaughter, and he comes over and says, "Grandma, it's a very nice story you're telling. Can I, can I listen in?" And he tells his wife, he says, "Joy, come over here, you wanna listen to my grandma's story?" So that's what, that's how he got that woman from the, from Japan, to interview me. I'm not even interested in what happened to me there. Right now, in truth, I'm very grateful, that I can take care of myself. The kids want me to be with them. But I don't want it. When I came I was very bad. I went, last Passover I went to the children for the holidays and they took me out on a stretcher. They didn't believe that I'm gonna live. And I was five weeks in the hospital. I was two weeks in intensive care. But, I had my life, I'm not, I'm not going to, and then I was with Lou and Edith three months after that. And I says, "I wanna go home." "Mom, why don't you want to stay, give up the apartment, you shouldn't be by yourself. We all love you." "It's nice you love me. I like to come as a visitor." In fact, I have an appointment with Edith, she's going to pick me up Saturday to go to Johnnie to see the baby . I'm in the best of friends with the children. But when it happened and my husband passed away, of course, it hit me, if a person is sick, you expect it. Here we came from being together for dinner with the children and we came up and we drove the car in the garage. And he came and sat on this chair, made the TV to hear the news, and he grabs my hand, "Take good care of yourself, sweetheart." That was it. So, of course, Lou, I called the children. I didn't tell them that their father was dead. I said, "Dad isn't feeling good. How about coming up? I don't want to be alone." Because I was afraid that while they were driving the car they go too fast. So they started like this, Lew and Edith says, "Mom, you come to us. You and Edith getting along so nicely." My older son lives in Jersey and he says, "Mom, I have three bedrooms. Only one son lives there now." The other one was married. "Come stay with me." I say, "Thank you, I will think about it." My youngest son lives in Rockaway Park. He hasn't got a house. Got a beautiful apartment. He says, "Mom, I haven't got a house, but I can get you an apartment in the same building." I says, "Do me a favor, children, I don't want to spoil the relationship I have with you, let me be by myself." It's not easy. It was easy until I took sick. Now doctor tells me I'm not allowed to. I can't clean the house. I pay for it, I get a girl in. I can't do my laundry. I can't do shopping because I'm not allowed to carry packages. Eventually, I fooled him a little bit once, too. I can't sit. (?) I had little pieces of wool, I made a coat. I cannot sit like this. But, thank God that I belong to the organizations, that I go out. I have Monday a meeting, Tuesday a, Wednesday a social, Thursday a meeting, Friday I stay in the house, I take care of the house a little bit. So I'm not one to stay in the house. DALLETT: When you look back over these years do you, can you imagine what it was you expected life in this country was gonna be like? SANTLOFER: No, you know what I, when I, now that I have plenty of time I sit and think it to myself how in the, excuse me, H-E-L-L did I take that (?). How did I do it? DALLETT: Which part? What amazes you? SANTLOFER: Hard work, hard work. Very hard work. We had the store. I took care of my house. I raised the children. I couldn't afford a help. Now it's, now it's, now it's nothing, according to the way it was. Because when the children grew up they got through school and they went to business and they got married. They came a little different. But this is good. My husband retired in '65, in January. And then we went away to Europe. We stopped in London, Paris, Greece and Florence. And we went to Israel. We stayed ten weeks in Israel. DALLETT: You never wanted to go to Poland, you didn't want to go back? SANTLOFER: No, I didn't even want to hear about it. I had too much of it. So how do you like my story? DALLETT: It's wonderful. SANTLOFER: Believe it or not, it's no end to it of what we went through, but still the truth of the matter is I wish my husband would be alive. Whatever how hard it was, you're not alone. I know, I don't, I don't want to get emotional. Okay. DALLETT: Do you have friends that date back to when you first came to this country, that went through the whole immigration experience? SANTLOFER: No, no, only one woman. One girl, rather, she came to (?) the year before, that we were raised up together and came on the same boat, but we lost each other. Because my life was entirely different. She was single. We had a family. We had to make a living with the move to Brooklyn, then we moved to College Point. When I moved to College Point I lost all connections with New York. Because it wasn't interesting to me. DALLETT: How about from the point of College Point, you made friends, you were still young then. Do you have friends from that period? SANTLOFER: Oh, to this day, to this day. DALLETT: And they went through similar kinds of experiences coming into this country? SANTLOFER: No, no, they were American people, American born. And, I'm the foreigner. But, uh, I have plenty of friends, and around here, too. The one good thing, I'm pretty fairly liked by people. DALLETT: Have you felt like a foreigner through your life? SANTLOFER: No. Somebody talking about, uh, I say, "I'm an American. This is my country. And you know it gets me when they, when they speak a different language in the street. You come here. You make a living. You get all the opportunities. Why the devil don't you speak the language of the town, of the, it's true, of the land. So. DALLETT: Do you still have any letters or anything like that, the letters that your sisters and brothers wrote when you were in Poland, from America . . . SANTLOFER: No, no, no. DALLETT: You don't have any of those? SANTLOFER: No, if I would have . . . DALLETT: Documents, passports, information . . . SANTLOFER: In fact, I left, I lost my passport when I came here a couple of years I had a hard time to get my citizenship because they couldn't find me in Ellis Island. (?) They found my whole family but not me. But then they found it, I got it. DALLETT: So when you got your citizenship it was after you took this, uh, reading course and test. SANTLOFER: Test. Yeah, you have to take a test, of course. DALLETT: And it was just granted automatically. How long after you had been in this country was it? SANTLOFER: You have to be five years, you know that. My husband became a citizen before me because I was always busy. But then I decided that I wanted to become a citizen, too. We started to go through the rigamaree and they couldn't fine me, I says, "It's not possible." And finally we, uh, we, I got my papers." DALLETT: Uh, I think that's all the questions I have. SANTLOFER: Good. DALLETT: Thank you very much. SANTLOFER: You're very welcome. DALLETT: This is the end of tape, Side B of tape number one of interview number 010 and we're ending at 7:15 PM.
